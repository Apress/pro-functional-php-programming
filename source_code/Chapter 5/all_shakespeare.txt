All's Well That Ends Well

ACT I
SCENE I. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA, and LAFEU, all in black

COUNTESS

    In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.

BERTRAM

    And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
    anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
    whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.

LAFEU

    You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
    sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
    good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
    worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
    than lack it where there is such abundance.

COUNTESS

    What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?

LAFEU

    He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
    practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
    finds no other advantage in the process but only the
    losing of hope by time.

COUNTESS

    This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
    'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
    almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
    far, would have made nature immortal, and death
    should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
    king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
    the death of the king's disease.

LAFEU

    How called you the man you speak of, madam?

COUNTESS

    He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
    his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.

LAFEU

    He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
    lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
    was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
    could be set up against mortality.

BERTRAM

    What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?

LAFEU

    A fistula, my lord.

BERTRAM

    I heard not of it before.

LAFEU

    I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
    the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?

COUNTESS

    His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
    overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
    her education promises; her dispositions she
    inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
    an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
    commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
    traitors too; in her they are the better for their
    simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.

LAFEU

    Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.

COUNTESS

    'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
    in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
    her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
    livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
    go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
    a sorrow than have it.

HELENA

    I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.

LAFEU

    Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
    excessive grief the enemy to the living.

COUNTESS

    If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
    makes it soon mortal.

BERTRAM

    Madam, I desire your holy wishes.

LAFEU

    How understand we that?

COUNTESS

    Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
    In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
    Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
    Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
    Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
    Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
    Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
    But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
    That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
    Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
    'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
    Advise him.

LAFEU

    He cannot want the best
    That shall attend his love.

COUNTESS

    Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.

    Exit

BERTRAM

    [To HELENA] The best wishes that can be forged in
    your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
    to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.

LAFEU

    Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
    your father.

    Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU

HELENA

    O, were that all! I think not on my father;
    And these great tears grace his remembrance more
    Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
    I have forgot him: my imagination
    Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
    I am undone: there is no living, none,
    If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
    That I should love a bright particular star
    And think to wed it, he is so above me:
    In his bright radiance and collateral light
    Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
    The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
    The hind that would be mated by the lion
    Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
    To see him every hour; to sit and draw
    His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
    In our heart's table; heart too capable
    Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
    But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
    Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?

    Enter PAROLLES

    Aside
    One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
    And yet I know him a notorious liar,
    Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
    Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
    That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
    Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
    Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.

PAROLLES

    Save you, fair queen!

HELENA

    And you, monarch!

PAROLLES

    No.

HELENA

    And no.

PAROLLES

    Are you meditating on virginity?

HELENA

    Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
    ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
    may we barricado it against him?

PAROLLES

    Keep him out.

HELENA

    But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
    in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
    warlike resistance.

PAROLLES

    There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
    undermine you and blow you up.

HELENA

    Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
    blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
    virgins might blow up men?

PAROLLES

    Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
    blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
    the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
    is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
    preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
    increase and there was never virgin got till
    virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
    metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
    may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
    ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!

HELENA

    I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.

PAROLLES

    There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
    rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
    is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
    disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
    virginity murders itself and should be buried in
    highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
    offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
    much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
    paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
    Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
    self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
    canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
    by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
    itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
    principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!

HELENA

    How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?

PAROLLES

    Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
    likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
    lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
    while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
    Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
    of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
    like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
    now. Your date is better in your pie and your
    porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
    your old virginity, is like one of our French
    withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
    'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
    marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?

HELENA

    Not my virginity yet [ ]
    There shall your master have a thousand loves,
    A mother and a mistress and a friend,
    A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
    A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
    A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
    His humble ambition, proud humility,
    His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
    His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
    Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
    That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
    I know not what he shall. God send him well!
    The court's a learning place, and he is one--

PAROLLES

    What one, i' faith?

HELENA

    That I wish well. 'Tis pity--

PAROLLES

    What's pity?

HELENA

    That wishing well had not a body in't,
    Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
    Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
    Might with effects of them follow our friends,
    And show what we alone must think, which never
    Return us thanks.

    Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.

    Exit

PAROLLES

    Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I
    will think of thee at court.

HELENA

    Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.

PAROLLES

    Under Mars, I.

HELENA

    I especially think, under Mars.

PAROLLES

    Why under Mars?

HELENA

    The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
    be born under Mars.

PAROLLES

    When he was predominant.

HELENA

    When he was retrograde, I think, rather.

PAROLLES

    Why think you so?

HELENA

    You go so much backward when you fight.

PAROLLES

    That's for advantage.

HELENA

    So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
    but the composition that your valour and fear makes
    in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.

PAROLLES

    I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
    acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
    which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
    thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
    counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
    thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
    thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
    thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
    none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
    and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.

    Exit

HELENA

    Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
    Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
    Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
    Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
    What power is it which mounts my love so high,
    That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
    The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
    To join like likes and kiss like native things.
    Impossible be strange attempts to those
    That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
    What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
    So show her merit, that did miss her love?
    The king's disease--my project may deceive me,
    But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.

    Exit

SCENE II. Paris. The KING's palace.

    Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France, with letters, and divers Attendants

KING

    The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
    Have fought with equal fortune and continue
    A braving war.

First Lord

    So 'tis reported, sir.

KING

    Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
    A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
    With caution that the Florentine will move us
    For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
    Prejudicates the business and would seem
    To have us make denial.

First Lord

    His love and wisdom,
    Approved so to your majesty, may plead
    For amplest credence.

KING

    He hath arm'd our answer,
    And Florence is denied before he comes:
    Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
    The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
    To stand on either part.

Second Lord

    It well may serve
    A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
    For breathing and exploit.

KING

    What's he comes here?

    Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES

First Lord

    It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
    Young Bertram.

KING

    Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
    Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
    Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
    Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.

BERTRAM

    My thanks and duty are your majesty's.

KING

    I would I had that corporal soundness now,
    As when thy father and myself in friendship
    First tried our soldiership! He did look far
    Into the service of the time and was
    Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
    But on us both did haggish age steal on
    And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
    To talk of your good father. In his youth
    He had the wit which I can well observe
    To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
    Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
    Ere they can hide their levity in honour;
    So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
    Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
    His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
    Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
    Exception bid him speak, and at this time
    His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
    He used as creatures of another place
    And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
    Making them proud of his humility,
    In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
    Might be a copy to these younger times;
    Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
    But goers backward.

BERTRAM

    His good remembrance, sir,
    Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
    So in approof lives not his epitaph
    As in your royal speech.

KING

    Would I were with him! He would always say--
    Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
    He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
    To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
    This his good melancholy oft began,
    On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
    When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
    'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
    Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
    All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
    Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
    Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;
    I after him do after him wish too,
    Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
    I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
    To give some labourers room.

Second Lord

    You are loved, sir:
    They that least lend it you shall lack you first.

KING

    I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
    Since the physician at your father's died?
    He was much famed.

BERTRAM

    Some six months since, my lord.

KING

    If he were living, I would try him yet.
    Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
    With several applications; nature and sickness
    Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
    My son's no dearer.

BERTRAM

    Thank your majesty.

    Exeunt. Flourish

SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown

COUNTESS

    I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?

Steward

    Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I
    wish might be found in the calendar of my past
    endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make
    foul the clearness of our deservings, when of
    ourselves we publish them.

COUNTESS

    What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:
    the complaints I have heard of you I do not all
    believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know
    you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability
    enough to make such knaveries yours.

Clown

    'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.

COUNTESS

    Well, sir.

Clown

    No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though
    many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have
    your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel
    the woman and I will do as we may.

COUNTESS

    Wilt thou needs be a beggar?

Clown

    I do beg your good will in this case.

COUNTESS

    In what case?

Clown

    In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
    heritage: and I think I shall never have the
    blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for
    they say barnes are blessings.

COUNTESS

    Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.

Clown

    My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
    by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.

COUNTESS

    Is this all your worship's reason?

Clown

    Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they
    are.

COUNTESS

    May the world know them?

Clown

    I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
    all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry
    that I may repent.

COUNTESS

    Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.

Clown

    I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have
    friends for my wife's sake.

COUNTESS

    Such friends are thine enemies, knave.

Clown

    You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the
    knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.
    He that ears my land spares my team and gives me
    leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my
    drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
    of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh
    and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my
    flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses
    my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to
    be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;
    for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the
    Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in
    religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl
    horns together, like any deer i' the herd.

COUNTESS

    Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?

Clown

    A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next
    way:
    For I the ballad will repeat,
    Which men full true shall find;
    Your marriage comes by destiny,
    Your cuckoo sings by kind.

COUNTESS

    Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.

Steward

    May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to
    you: of her I am to speak.

COUNTESS

    Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;
    Helen, I mean.

Clown

    Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
    Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
    Fond done, done fond,
    Was this King Priam's joy?
    With that she sighed as she stood,
    With that she sighed as she stood,
    And gave this sentence then;
    Among nine bad if one be good,
    Among nine bad if one be good,
    There's yet one good in ten.

COUNTESS

    What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.

Clown

    One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying
    o' the song: would God would serve the world so all
    the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,
    if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we
    might have a good woman born but one every blazing
    star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery
    well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck
    one.

COUNTESS

    You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.

Clown

    That man should be at woman's command, and yet no
    hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it
    will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of
    humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am
    going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.

    Exit

COUNTESS

    Well, now.

Steward

    I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.

COUNTESS

    Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and
    she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully
    make title to as much love as she finds: there is
    more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid
    her than she'll demand.

Steward

    Madam, I was very late more near her than I think
    she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate
    to herself her own words to her own ears; she
    thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any
    stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:
    Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put
    such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no
    god, that would not extend his might, only where
    qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that
    would suffer her poor knight surprised, without
    rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.
    This she delivered in the most bitter touch of
    sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I
    held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;
    sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns
    you something to know it.

COUNTESS

    You have discharged this honestly; keep it to
    yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this
    before, which hung so tottering in the balance that
    I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,
    leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you
    for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.

    Exit Steward

    Enter HELENA
    Even so it was with me when I was young:
    If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
    Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
    Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;
    It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
    Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:
    By our remembrances of days foregone,
    Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
    Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.

HELENA

    What is your pleasure, madam?

COUNTESS

    You know, Helen,
    I am a mother to you.

HELENA

    Mine honourable mistress.

COUNTESS

    Nay, a mother:
    Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
    Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'
    That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;
    And put you in the catalogue of those
    That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
    Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
    A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
    You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
    Yet I express to you a mother's care:
    God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
    To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
    That this distemper'd messenger of wet,
    The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
    Why? that you are my daughter?

HELENA

    That I am not.

COUNTESS

    I say, I am your mother.

HELENA

    Pardon, madam;
    The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
    I am from humble, he from honour'd name;
    No note upon my parents, his all noble:
    My master, my dear lord he is; and I
    His servant live, and will his vassal die:
    He must not be my brother.

COUNTESS

    Nor I your mother?

HELENA

    You are my mother, madam; would you were,--
    So that my lord your son were not my brother,--
    Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,
    I care no more for than I do for heaven,
    So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
    But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?

COUNTESS

    Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:
    God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
    So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
    My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see
    The mystery of your loneliness, and find
    Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
    You love my son; invention is ashamed,
    Against the proclamation of thy passion,
    To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
    But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks
    Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
    See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
    That in their kind they speak it: only sin
    And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
    That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
    If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
    If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,
    As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
    Tell me truly.

HELENA

    Good madam, pardon me!

COUNTESS

    Do you love my son?

HELENA

    Your pardon, noble mistress!

COUNTESS

    Love you my son?

HELENA

    Do not you love him, madam?

COUNTESS

    Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,
    Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
    The state of your affection; for your passions
    Have to the full appeach'd.

HELENA

    Then, I confess,
    Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
    That before you, and next unto high heaven,
    I love your son.
    My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:
    Be not offended; for it hurts not him
    That he is loved of me: I follow him not
    By any token of presumptuous suit;
    Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
    Yet never know how that desert should be.
    I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
    Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
    I still pour in the waters of my love
    And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,
    Religious in mine error, I adore
    The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
    But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
    Let not your hate encounter with my love
    For loving where you do: but if yourself,
    Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
    Did ever in so true a flame of liking
    Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
    Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity
    To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
    But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
    That seeks not to find that her search implies,
    But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!

COUNTESS

    Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--
    To go to Paris?

HELENA

    Madam, I had.

COUNTESS

    Wherefore? tell true.

HELENA

    I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
    You know my father left me some prescriptions
    Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
    And manifest experience had collected
    For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
    In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
    As notes whose faculties inclusive were
    More than they were in note: amongst the rest,
    There is a remedy, approved, set down,
    To cure the desperate languishings whereof
    The king is render'd lost.

COUNTESS

    This was your motive
    For Paris, was it? speak.

HELENA

    My lord your son made me to think of this;
    Else Paris and the medicine and the king
    Had from the conversation of my thoughts
    Haply been absent then.

COUNTESS

    But think you, Helen,
    If you should tender your supposed aid,
    He would receive it? he and his physicians
    Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
    They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
    A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
    Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
    The danger to itself?

HELENA

    There's something in't,
    More than my father's skill, which was the greatest
    Of his profession, that his good receipt
    Shall for my legacy be sanctified
    By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
    But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture
    The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
    By such a day and hour.

COUNTESS

    Dost thou believe't?

HELENA

    Ay, madam, knowingly.

COUNTESS

    Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
    Means and attendants and my loving greetings
    To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home
    And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:
    Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
    What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Paris. The KING's palace.

    Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING, attended with divers young Lords taking leave for the Florentine war; BERTRAM, and PAROLLES

KING

    Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles
    Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:
    Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all
    The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,
    And is enough for both.

First Lord

    'Tis our hope, sir,
    After well enter'd soldiers, to return
    And find your grace in health.

KING

    No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
    Will not confess he owes the malady
    That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
    Whether I live or die, be you the sons
    Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--
    Those bated that inherit but the fall
    Of the last monarchy,--see that you come
    Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
    The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
    That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.

Second Lord

    Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!

KING

    Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:
    They say, our French lack language to deny,
    If they demand: beware of being captives,
    Before you serve.

Both

    Our hearts receive your warnings.

KING

    Farewell. Come hither to me.

    Exit, attended

First Lord

    O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!

PAROLLES

    'Tis not his fault, the spark.

Second Lord

    O, 'tis brave wars!

PAROLLES

    Most admirable: I have seen those wars.

BERTRAM

    I am commanded here, and kept a coil with
    'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'

PAROLLES

    An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.

BERTRAM

    I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
    Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
    Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
    But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.

First Lord

    There's honour in the theft.

PAROLLES

    Commit it, count.

Second Lord

    I am your accessary; and so, farewell.

BERTRAM

    I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.

First Lord

    Farewell, captain.

Second Lord

    Sweet Monsieur Parolles!

PAROLLES

    Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good
    sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall
    find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain
    Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here
    on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
    entrenched it: say to him, I live; and observe his
    reports for me.

First Lord

    We shall, noble captain.

    Exeunt Lords

PAROLLES

    Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?

BERTRAM

    Stay: the king.

    Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire

PAROLLES

    [To BERTRAM] Use a more spacious ceremony to the
    noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the
    list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to
    them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the
    time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and
    move under the influence of the most received star;
    and though the devil lead the measure, such are to
    be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.

BERTRAM

    And I will do so.

PAROLLES

    Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.

    Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES

    Enter LAFEU

LAFEU

    [Kneeling] Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.

KING

    I'll fee thee to stand up.

LAFEU

    Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.
    I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,
    And that at my bidding you could so stand up.

KING

    I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
    And ask'd thee mercy for't.

LAFEU

    Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;
    Will you be cured of your infirmity?

KING

    No.

LAFEU

    O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
    Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
    My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
    That's able to breathe life into a stone,
    Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
    With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,
    Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
    To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,
    And write to her a love-line.

KING

    What 'her' is this?

LAFEU

    Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,
    If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
    If seriously I may convey my thoughts
    In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
    With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
    Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
    Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
    For that is her demand, and know her business?
    That done, laugh well at me.

KING

    Now, good Lafeu,
    Bring in the admiration; that we with thee
    May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
    By wondering how thou took'st it.

LAFEU

    Nay, I'll fit you,
    And not be all day neither.

    Exit

KING

    Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.

    Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA

LAFEU

    Nay, come your ways.

KING

    This haste hath wings indeed.

LAFEU

    Nay, come your ways:
    This is his majesty; say your mind to him:
    A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
    His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,
    That dare leave two together; fare you well.

    Exit

KING

    Now, fair one, does your business follow us?

HELENA

    Ay, my good lord.
    Gerard de Narbon was my father;
    In what he did profess, well found.

KING

    I knew him.

HELENA

    The rather will I spare my praises towards him:
    Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
    Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
    Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,
    And of his old experience the oily darling,
    He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
    Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;
    And hearing your high majesty is touch'd
    With that malignant cause wherein the honour
    Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
    I come to tender it and my appliance
    With all bound humbleness.

KING

    We thank you, maiden;
    But may not be so credulous of cure,
    When our most learned doctors leave us and
    The congregated college have concluded
    That labouring art can never ransom nature
    From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
    So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
    To prostitute our past-cure malady
    To empirics, or to dissever so
    Our great self and our credit, to esteem
    A senseless help when help past sense we deem.

HELENA

    My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
    I will no more enforce mine office on you.
    Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
    A modest one, to bear me back again.

KING

    I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:
    Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
    As one near death to those that wish him live:
    But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
    I knowing all my peril, thou no art.

HELENA

    What I can do can do no hurt to try,
    Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
    He that of greatest works is finisher
    Oft does them by the weakest minister:
    So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
    When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
    From simple sources, and great seas have dried
    When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
    Oft expectation fails and most oft there
    Where most it promises, and oft it hits
    Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.

KING

    I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
    Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
    Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.

HELENA

    Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:
    It is not so with Him that all things knows
    As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
    But most it is presumption in us when
    The help of heaven we count the act of men.
    Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
    Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
    I am not an impostor that proclaim
    Myself against the level of mine aim;
    But know I think and think I know most sure
    My art is not past power nor you past cure.

KING

    Are thou so confident? within what space
    Hopest thou my cure?

HELENA

    The great'st grace lending grace
    Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
    Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
    Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
    Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
    Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
    Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
    What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
    Health shall live free and sickness freely die.

KING

    Upon thy certainty and confidence
    What darest thou venture?

HELENA

    Tax of impudence,
    A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame
    Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name
    Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended
    With vilest torture let my life be ended.

KING

    Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
    His powerful sound within an organ weak:
    And what impossibility would slay
    In common sense, sense saves another way.
    Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
    Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,
    Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
    That happiness and prime can happy call:
    Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
    Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
    Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
    That ministers thine own death if I die.

HELENA

    If I break time, or flinch in property
    Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
    And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;
    But, if I help, what do you promise me?

KING

    Make thy demand.

HELENA

    But will you make it even?

KING

    Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.

HELENA

    Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
    What husband in thy power I will command:
    Exempted be from me the arrogance
    To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
    My low and humble name to propagate
    With any branch or image of thy state;
    But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
    Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.

KING

    Here is my hand; the premises observed,
    Thy will by my performance shall be served:
    So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
    Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
    More should I question thee, and more I must,
    Though more to know could not be more to trust,
    From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest
    Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
    Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
    As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.

    Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter COUNTESS and Clown

COUNTESS

    Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of
    your breeding.

Clown

    I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I
    know my business is but to the court.

COUNTESS

    To the court! why, what place make you special,
    when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!

Clown

    Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he
    may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make
    a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,
    has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed
    such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
    court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all
    men.

COUNTESS

    Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all
    questions.

Clown

    It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,
    the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
    buttock, or any buttock.

COUNTESS

    Will your answer serve fit to all questions?

Clown

    As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,
    as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's
    rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove
    Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his
    hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen
    to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the
    friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.

COUNTESS

    Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all
    questions?

Clown

    From below your duke to beneath your constable, it
    will fit any question.

COUNTESS

    It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
    must fit all demands.

Clown

    But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned
    should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that
    belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall
    do you no harm to learn.

COUNTESS

    To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in
    question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I
    pray you, sir, are you a courtier?

Clown

    O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,
    more, a hundred of them.

COUNTESS

    Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.

Clown

    O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.

COUNTESS

    I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.

Clown

    O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.

COUNTESS

    You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.

Clown

    O Lord, sir! spare not me.

COUNTESS

    Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and
    'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very
    sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well
    to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.

Clown

    I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,
    sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.

COUNTESS

    I play the noble housewife with the time
    To entertain't so merrily with a fool.

Clown

    O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.

COUNTESS

    An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,
    And urge her to a present answer back:
    Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:
    This is not much.

Clown

    Not much commendation to them.

COUNTESS

    Not much employment for you: you understand me?

Clown

    Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.

COUNTESS

    Haste you again.

    Exeunt severally

SCENE III. Paris. The KING's palace.

    Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES

LAFEU

    They say miracles are past; and we have our
    philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,
    things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that
    we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
    into seeming knowledge, when we should submit
    ourselves to an unknown fear.

PAROLLES

    Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
    shot out in our latter times.

BERTRAM

    And so 'tis.

LAFEU

    To be relinquish'd of the artists,--

PAROLLES

    So I say.

LAFEU

    Both of Galen and Paracelsus.

PAROLLES

    So I say.

LAFEU

    Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--

PAROLLES

    Right; so I say.

LAFEU

    That gave him out incurable,--

PAROLLES

    Why, there 'tis; so say I too.

LAFEU

    Not to be helped,--

PAROLLES

    Right; as 'twere, a man assured of a--

LAFEU

    Uncertain life, and sure death.

PAROLLES

    Just, you say well; so would I have said.

LAFEU

    I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.

PAROLLES

    It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you
    shall read it in--what do you call there?

LAFEU

    A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.

PAROLLES

    That's it; I would have said the very same.

LAFEU

    Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,
    I speak in respect--

PAROLLES

    Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the
    brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most
    facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the--

LAFEU

    Very hand of heaven.

PAROLLES

    Ay, so I say.

LAFEU

    In a most weak--

    pausing
    and debile minister, great power, great
    transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a
    further use to be made than alone the recovery of
    the king, as to be--

    pausing
    generally thankful.

PAROLLES

    I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.

    Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants. LAFEU and PAROLLES retire

LAFEU

    Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the
    better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he's
    able to lead her a coranto.

PAROLLES

    Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?

LAFEU

    'Fore God, I think so.

KING

    Go, call before me all the lords in court.
    Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
    And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
    Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive
    The confirmation of my promised gift,
    Which but attends thy naming.

    Enter three or four Lords
    Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
    Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
    O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
    I have to use: thy frank election make;
    Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.

HELENA

    To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
    Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!

LAFEU

    I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,
    My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
    And writ as little beard.

KING

    Peruse them well:
    Not one of those but had a noble father.

HELENA

    Gentlemen,
    Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.

All

    We understand it, and thank heaven for you.

HELENA

    I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,
    That I protest I simply am a maid.
    Please it your majesty, I have done already:
    The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
    'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
    Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;
    We'll ne'er come there again.'

KING

    Make choice; and, see,
    Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.

HELENA

    Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
    And to imperial Love, that god most high,
    Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?

First Lord

    And grant it.

HELENA

    Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.

LAFEU

    I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace
    for my life.

HELENA

    The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
    Before I speak, too threateningly replies:
    Love make your fortunes twenty times above
    Her that so wishes and her humble love!

Second Lord

    No better, if you please.

HELENA

    My wish receive,
    Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.

LAFEU

    Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,
    I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the
    Turk, to make eunuchs of.

HELENA

    Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
    I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:
    Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
    Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!

LAFEU

    These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:
    sure, they are bastards to the English; the French
    ne'er got 'em.

HELENA

    You are too young, too happy, and too good,
    To make yourself a son out of my blood.

Fourth Lord

    Fair one, I think not so.

LAFEU

    There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk
    wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth
    of fourteen; I have known thee already.

HELENA

    [To BERTRAM] I dare not say I take you; but I give
    Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
    Into your guiding power. This is the man.

KING

    Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.

BERTRAM

    My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,
    In such a business give me leave to use
    The help of mine own eyes.

KING

    Know'st thou not, Bertram,
    What she has done for me?

BERTRAM

    Yes, my good lord;
    But never hope to know why I should marry her.

KING

    Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.

BERTRAM

    But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
    Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
    She had her breeding at my father's charge.
    A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
    Rather corrupt me ever!

KING

    'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
    I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
    Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
    Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
    In differences so mighty. If she be
    All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
    A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest
    Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
    From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
    The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
    Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
    It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
    Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
    The property by what it is should go,
    Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
    In these to nature she's immediate heir,
    And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
    Which challenges itself as honour's born
    And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
    When rather from our acts we them derive
    Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
    Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
    A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
    Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
    Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
    If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
    I can create the rest: virtue and she
    Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.

BERTRAM

    I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.

KING

    Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.

HELENA

    That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:
    Let the rest go.

KING

    My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
    I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
    Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
    That dost in vile misprision shackle up
    My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
    We, poising us in her defective scale,
    Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
    It is in us to plant thine honour where
    We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
    Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
    Believe not thy disdain, but presently
    Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
    Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
    Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
    Into the staggers and the careless lapse
    Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
    Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
    Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.

BERTRAM

    Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
    My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
    What great creation and what dole of honour
    Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
    Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
    The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
    Is as 'twere born so.

KING

    Take her by the hand,
    And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
    A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
    A balance more replete.

BERTRAM

    I take her hand.

KING

    Good fortune and the favour of the king
    Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
    Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
    And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
    Shall more attend upon the coming space,
    Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,
    Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.

    Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES

LAFEU

    [Advancing] Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.

PAROLLES

    Your pleasure, sir?

LAFEU

    Your lord and master did well to make his
    recantation.

PAROLLES

    Recantation! My lord! my master!

LAFEU

    Ay; is it not a language I speak?

PAROLLES

    A most harsh one, and not to be understood without
    bloody succeeding. My master!

LAFEU

    Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?

PAROLLES

    To any count, to all counts, to what is man.

LAFEU

    To what is count's man: count's master is of
    another style.

PAROLLES

    You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.

LAFEU

    I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which
    title age cannot bring thee.

PAROLLES

    What I dare too well do, I dare not do.

LAFEU

    I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty
    wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
    travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the
    bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
    believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I
    have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care
    not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and
    that thou't scarce worth.

PAROLLES

    Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--

LAFEU

    Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou
    hasten thy trial; which if--Lord have mercy on thee
    for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee
    well: thy casement I need not open, for I look
    through thee. Give me thy hand.

PAROLLES

    My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.

LAFEU

    Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.

PAROLLES

    I have not, my lord, deserved it.

LAFEU

    Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not
    bate thee a scruple.

PAROLLES

    Well, I shall be wiser.

LAFEU

    Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at
    a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound
    in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is
    to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold
    my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,
    that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.

PAROLLES

    My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.

LAFEU

    I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor
    doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by
    thee, in what motion age will give me leave.

    Exit

PAROLLES

    Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off
    me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must
    be patient; there is no fettering of authority.
    I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with
    any convenience, an he were double and double a
    lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I
    would of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.

    Re-enter LAFEU

LAFEU

    Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news
    for you: you have a new mistress.

PAROLLES

    I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
    some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good
    lord: whom I serve above is my master.

LAFEU

    Who? God?

PAROLLES

    Ay, sir.

LAFEU

    The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou
    garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of
    sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set
    thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine
    honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat
    thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and
    every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
    created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.

PAROLLES

    This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.

LAFEU

    Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a
    kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and
    no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords
    and honourable personages than the commission of your
    birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not
    worth another word, else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.

    Exit

PAROLLES

    Good, very good; it is so then: good, very good;
    let it be concealed awhile.

    Re-enter BERTRAM

BERTRAM

    Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!

PAROLLES

    What's the matter, sweet-heart?

BERTRAM

    Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
    I will not bed her.

PAROLLES

    What, what, sweet-heart?

BERTRAM

    O my Parolles, they have married me!
    I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.

PAROLLES

    France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
    The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!

BERTRAM

    There's letters from my mother: what the import is,
    I know not yet.

PAROLLES

    Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
    He wears his honour in a box unseen,
    That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
    Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
    Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
    Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions
    France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
    Therefore, to the war!

BERTRAM

    It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,
    Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
    And wherefore I am fled; write to the king
    That which I durst not speak; his present gift
    Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
    Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
    To the dark house and the detested wife.

PAROLLES

    Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?

BERTRAM

    Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
    I'll send her straight away: to-morrow
    I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.

PAROLLES

    Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
    A young man married is a man that's marr'd:
    Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:
    The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Paris. The KING's palace.

    Enter HELENA and Clown

HELENA

    My mother greets me kindly; is she well?

Clown

    She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's
    very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be
    given, she's very well and wants nothing i', the
    world; but yet she is not well.

HELENA

    If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's
    not very well?

Clown

    Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.

HELENA

    What two things?

Clown

    One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her
    quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence
    God send her quickly!

    Enter PAROLLES

PAROLLES

    Bless you, my fortunate lady!

HELENA

    I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own
    good fortunes.

PAROLLES

    You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them
    on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?

Clown

    So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,
    I would she did as you say.

PAROLLES

    Why, I say nothing.

Clown

    Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's
    tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say
    nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have
    nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which
    is within a very little of nothing.

PAROLLES

    Away! thou'rt a knave.

Clown

    You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a
    knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
    been truth, sir.

PAROLLES

    Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.

Clown

    Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you
    taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;
    and much fool may you find in you, even to the
    world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.

PAROLLES

    A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
    Madam, my lord will go away to-night;
    A very serious business calls on him.
    The great prerogative and rite of love,
    Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
    But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
    Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
    Which they distil now in the curbed time,
    To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
    And pleasure drown the brim.

HELENA

    What's his will else?

PAROLLES

    That you will take your instant leave o' the king
    And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
    Strengthen'd with what apology you think
    May make it probable need.

HELENA

    What more commands he?

PAROLLES

    That, having this obtain'd, you presently
    Attend his further pleasure.

HELENA

    In every thing I wait upon his will.

PAROLLES

    I shall report it so.

HELENA

    I pray you.

    Exit PAROLLES
    Come, sirrah.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Paris. The KING's palace.

    Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM

LAFEU

    But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.

BERTRAM

    Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.

LAFEU

    You have it from his own deliverance.

BERTRAM

    And by other warranted testimony.

LAFEU

    Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.

BERTRAM

    I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in
    knowledge and accordingly valiant.

LAFEU

    I have then sinned against his experience and
    transgressed against his valour; and my state that
    way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my
    heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make
    us friends; I will pursue the amity.

    Enter PAROLLES

PAROLLES

    [To BERTRAM] These things shall be done, sir.

LAFEU

    Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?

PAROLLES

    Sir?

LAFEU

    O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, 's a good
    workman, a very good tailor.

BERTRAM

    [Aside to PAROLLES] Is she gone to the king?

PAROLLES

    She is.

BERTRAM

    Will she away to-night?

PAROLLES

    As you'll have her.

BERTRAM

    I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
    Given order for our horses; and to-night,
    When I should take possession of the bride,
    End ere I do begin.

LAFEU

    A good traveller is something at the latter end of a
    dinner; but one that lies three thirds and uses a
    known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should
    be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.

BERTRAM

    Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?

PAROLLES

    I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
    displeasure.

LAFEU

    You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs
    and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and
    out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer
    question for your residence.

BERTRAM

    It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.

LAFEU

    And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's
    prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this
    of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the
    soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in
    matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
    tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:
    I have spoken better of you than you have or will to
    deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.

    Exit

PAROLLES

    An idle lord. I swear.

BERTRAM

    I think so.

PAROLLES

    Why, do you not know him?

BERTRAM

    Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
    Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.

    Enter HELENA

HELENA

    I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
    Spoke with the king and have procured his leave
    For present parting; only he desires
    Some private speech with you.

BERTRAM

    I shall obey his will.
    You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
    Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
    The ministration and required office
    On my particular. Prepared I was not
    For such a business; therefore am I found
    So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you
    That presently you take our way for home;
    And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
    For my respects are better than they seem
    And my appointments have in them a need
    Greater than shows itself at the first view
    To you that know them not. This to my mother:

    Giving a letter
    'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so
    I leave you to your wisdom.

HELENA

    Sir, I can nothing say,
    But that I am your most obedient servant.

BERTRAM

    Come, come, no more of that.

HELENA

    And ever shall
    With true observance seek to eke out that
    Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
    To equal my great fortune.

BERTRAM

    Let that go:
    My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.

HELENA

    Pray, sir, your pardon.

BERTRAM

    Well, what would you say?

HELENA

    I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
    Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
    But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
    What law does vouch mine own.

BERTRAM

    What would you have?

HELENA

    Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
    I would not tell you what I would, my lord:
    Faith yes;
    Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.

BERTRAM

    I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.

HELENA

    I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.

BERTRAM

    Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.

    Exit HELENA
    Go thou toward home; where I will never come
    Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
    Away, and for our flight.

PAROLLES

    Bravely, coragio!

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Florence. The DUKE's palace.

    Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence attended; the two Frenchmen, with a troop of soldiers.

DUKE

    So that from point to point now have you heard
    The fundamental reasons of this war,
    Whose great decision hath much blood let forth
    And more thirsts after.

First Lord

    Holy seems the quarrel
    Upon your grace's part; black and fearful
    On the opposer.

DUKE

    Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
    Would in so just a business shut his bosom
    Against our borrowing prayers.

Second Lord

    Good my lord,
    The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
    But like a common and an outward man,
    That the great figure of a council frames
    By self-unable motion: therefore dare not
    Say what I think of it, since I have found
    Myself in my incertain grounds to fail
    As often as I guess'd.

DUKE

    Be it his pleasure.

First Lord

    But I am sure the younger of our nature,
    That surfeit on their ease, will day by day
    Come here for physic.

DUKE

    Welcome shall they be;
    And all the honours that can fly from us
    Shall on them settle. You know your places well;
    When better fall, for your avails they fell:
    To-morrow to the field.

    Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter COUNTESS and Clown

COUNTESS

    It hath happened all as I would have had it, save
    that he comes not along with her.

Clown

    By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very
    melancholy man.

COUNTESS

    By what observance, I pray you?

Clown

    Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the
    ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
    teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of
    melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.

COUNTESS

    Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.

    Opening a letter

Clown

    I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our
    old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing
    like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:
    the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to
    love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.

COUNTESS

    What have we here?

Clown

    E'en that you have there.

    Exit

COUNTESS

    [Reads] I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath
    recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded
    her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'
    eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it
    before the report come. If there be breadth enough
    in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty
    to you. Your unfortunate son,
    BERTRAM.
    This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
    To fly the favours of so good a king;
    To pluck his indignation on thy head
    By the misprising of a maid too virtuous
    For the contempt of empire.

    Re-enter Clown

Clown

    O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two
    soldiers and my young lady!

COUNTESS

    What is the matter?

Clown

    Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
    comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I
    thought he would.

COUNTESS

    Why should he be killed?

Clown

    So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:
    the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of
    men, though it be the getting of children. Here
    they come will tell you more: for my part, I only
    hear your son was run away.

    Exit

    Enter HELENA, and two Gentlemen

First Gentleman

    Save you, good madam.

HELENA

    Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.

Second Gentleman

    Do not say so.

COUNTESS

    Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,
    I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,
    That the first face of neither, on the start,
    Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?

Second Gentleman

    Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:
    We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
    And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
    Thither we bend again.

HELENA

    Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.

    Reads
    When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which
    never shall come off, and show me a child begotten
    of thy body that I am father to, then call me
    husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'
    This is a dreadful sentence.

COUNTESS

    Brought you this letter, gentlemen?

First Gentleman

    Ay, madam;
    And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.

COUNTESS

    I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
    If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
    Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;
    But I do wash his name out of my blood,
    And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?

Second Gentleman

    Ay, madam.

COUNTESS

    And to be a soldier?

Second Gentleman

    Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,
    The duke will lay upon him all the honour
    That good convenience claims.

COUNTESS

    Return you thither?

First Gentleman

    Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.

HELENA

    [Reads] Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
    'Tis bitter.

COUNTESS

    Find you that there?

HELENA

    Ay, madam.

First Gentleman

    'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his
    heart was not consenting to.

COUNTESS

    Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
    There's nothing here that is too good for him
    But only she; and she deserves a lord
    That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
    And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?

First Gentleman

    A servant only, and a gentleman
    Which I have sometime known.

COUNTESS

    Parolles, was it not?

First Gentleman

    Ay, my good lady, he.

COUNTESS

    A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
    My son corrupts a well-derived nature
    With his inducement.

First Gentleman

    Indeed, good lady,
    The fellow has a deal of that too much,
    Which holds him much to have.

COUNTESS

    You're welcome, gentlemen.
    I will entreat you, when you see my son,
    To tell him that his sword can never win
    The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
    Written to bear along.

Second Gentleman

    We serve you, madam,
    In that and all your worthiest affairs.

COUNTESS

    Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
    Will you draw near!

    Exeunt COUNTESS and Gentlemen

HELENA

    'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
    Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
    Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;
    Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I
    That chase thee from thy country and expose
    Those tender limbs of thine to the event
    Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
    That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
    Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
    Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
    That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
    Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
    That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
    Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
    Whoever charges on his forward breast,
    I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
    And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
    His death was so effected: better 'twere
    I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
    With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
    That all the miseries which nature owes
    Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
    Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
    As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
    My being here it is that holds thee hence:
    Shall I stay here to do't? no, no, although
    The air of paradise did fan the house
    And angels officed all: I will be gone,
    That pitiful rumour may report my flight,
    To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!
    For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.

    Exit

SCENE III. Florence. Before the DUKE's palace.

    Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence, BERTRAM, PAROLLES, Soldiers, Drum, and Trumpets

DUKE

    The general of our horse thou art; and we,
    Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
    Upon thy promising fortune.

BERTRAM

    Sir, it is
    A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
    We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
    To the extreme edge of hazard.

DUKE

    Then go thou forth;
    And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
    As thy auspicious mistress!

BERTRAM

    This very day,
    Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
    Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
    A lover of thy drum, hater of love.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter COUNTESS and Steward

COUNTESS

    Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
    Might you not know she would do as she has done,
    By sending me a letter? Read it again.

Steward

    [Reads]
    I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:
    Ambitious love hath so in me offended,
    That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
    With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
    Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
    My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:
    Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
    His name with zealous fervor sanctify:
    His taken labours bid him me forgive;
    I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
    From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
    Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:
    He is too good and fair for death and me:
    Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.

COUNTESS

    Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
    Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,
    As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,
    I could have well diverted her intents,
    Which thus she hath prevented.

Steward

    Pardon me, madam:
    If I had given you this at over-night,
    She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,
    Pursuit would be but vain.

COUNTESS

    What angel shall
    Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
    Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
    And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
    Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
    To this unworthy husband of his wife;
    Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
    That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.
    Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
    Dispatch the most convenient messenger:
    When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
    He will return; and hope I may that she,
    Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
    Led hither by pure love: which of them both
    Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense
    To make distinction: provide this messenger:
    My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;
    Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.

    Enter an old Widow of Florence, DIANA, VIOLENTA, and MARIANA, with other Citizens

Widow

    Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we
    shall lose all the sight.

DIANA

    They say the French count has done most honourable service.

Widow

    It is reported that he has taken their greatest
    commander; and that with his own hand he slew the
    duke's brother.

    Tucket
    We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary
    way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.

MARIANA

    Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with
    the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this
    French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and
    no legacy is so rich as honesty.

Widow

    I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited
    by a gentleman his companion.

MARIANA

    I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a
    filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the
    young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,
    enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of
    lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid
    hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,
    example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of
    maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,
    but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten
    them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but
    I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,
    though there were no further danger known but the
    modesty which is so lost.

DIANA

    You shall not need to fear me.

Widow

    I hope so.

    Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim
    Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at
    my house; thither they send one another: I'll
    question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?

HELENA

    To Saint Jaques le Grand.
    Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?

Widow

    At the Saint Francis here beside the port.

HELENA

    Is this the way?

Widow

    Ay, marry, is't.

    A march afar
    Hark you! they come this way.
    If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
    But till the troops come by,
    I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;
    The rather, for I think I know your hostess
    As ample as myself.

HELENA

    Is it yourself?

Widow

    If you shall please so, pilgrim.

HELENA

    I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.

Widow

    You came, I think, from France?

HELENA

    I did so.

Widow

    Here you shall see a countryman of yours
    That has done worthy service.

HELENA

    His name, I pray you.

DIANA

    The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?

HELENA

    But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:
    His face I know not.

DIANA

    Whatsome'er he is,
    He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
    As 'tis reported, for the king had married him
    Against his liking: think you it is so?

HELENA

    Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.

DIANA

    There is a gentleman that serves the count
    Reports but coarsely of her.

HELENA

    What's his name?

DIANA

    Monsieur Parolles.

HELENA

    O, I believe with him,
    In argument of praise, or to the worth
    Of the great count himself, she is too mean
    To have her name repeated: all her deserving
    Is a reserved honesty, and that
    I have not heard examined.

DIANA

    Alas, poor lady!
    'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
    Of a detesting lord.

Widow

    I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,
    Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her
    A shrewd turn, if she pleased.

HELENA

    How do you mean?
    May be the amorous count solicits her
    In the unlawful purpose.

Widow

    He does indeed;
    And brokes with all that can in such a suit
    Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:
    But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
    In honestest defence.

MARIANA

    The gods forbid else!

Widow

    So, now they come:

    Drum and Colours

    Enter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole army
    That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;
    That, Escalus.

HELENA

    Which is the Frenchman?

DIANA

    He;
    That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.
    I would he loved his wife: if he were honester
    He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?

HELENA

    I like him well.

DIANA

    'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave
    That leads him to these places: were I his lady,
    I would Poison that vile rascal.

HELENA

    Which is he?

DIANA

    That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?

HELENA

    Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.

PAROLLES

    Lose our drum! well.

MARIANA

    He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.

Widow

    Marry, hang you!

MARIANA

    And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!

    Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and army

Widow

    The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
    Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents
    There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
    Already at my house.

HELENA

    I humbly thank you:
    Please it this matron and this gentle maid
    To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking
    Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,
    I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
    Worthy the note.

BOTH

    We'll take your offer kindly.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Camp before Florence.

    Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords

Second Lord

    Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his
    way.

First Lord

    If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no
    more in your respect.

Second Lord

    On my life, my lord, a bubble.

BERTRAM

    Do you think I am so far deceived in him?

Second Lord

    Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
    without any malice, but to speak of him as my
    kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and
    endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner
    of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
    entertainment.

First Lord

    It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in
    his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some
    great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.

BERTRAM

    I would I knew in what particular action to try him.

First Lord

    None better than to let him fetch off his drum,
    which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.

Second Lord

    I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
    surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he
    knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
    him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he
    is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when
    we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
    present at his examination: if he do not, for the
    promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
    base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the
    intelligence in his power against you, and that with
    the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never
    trust my judgment in any thing.

First Lord

    O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;
    he says he has a stratagem for't: when your
    lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to
    what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
    melted, if you give him not John Drum's
    entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.
    Here he comes.

    Enter PAROLLES

Second Lord

    [Aside to BERTRAM] O, for the love of laughter,
    hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch
    off his drum in any hand.

BERTRAM

    How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your
    disposition.

First Lord

    A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.

PAROLLES

    'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!
    There was excellent command,--to charge in with our
    horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!

First Lord

    That was not to be blamed in the command of the
    service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar
    himself could not have prevented, if he had been
    there to command.

BERTRAM

    Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some
    dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is
    not to be recovered.

PAROLLES

    It might have been recovered.

BERTRAM

    It might; but it is not now.

PAROLLES

    It is to be recovered: but that the merit of
    service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
    performer, I would have that drum or another, or
    'hic jacet.'

BERTRAM

    Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you
    think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
    instrument of honour again into his native quarter,
    be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will
    grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you
    speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.
    and extend to you what further becomes his
    greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your
    worthiness.

PAROLLES

    By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.

BERTRAM

    But you must not now slumber in it.

PAROLLES

    I'll about it this evening: and I will presently
    pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my
    certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;
    and by midnight look to hear further from me.

BERTRAM

    May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?

PAROLLES

    I know not what the success will be, my lord; but
    the attempt I vow.

BERTRAM

    I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of
    thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.

PAROLLES

    I love not many words.

    Exit

Second Lord

    No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a
    strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems
    to undertake this business, which he knows is not to
    be done; damns himself to do and dares better be
    damned than to do't?

First Lord

    You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it
    is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
    for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but
    when you find him out, you have him ever after.

BERTRAM

    Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of
    this that so seriously he does address himself unto?

Second Lord

    None in the world; but return with an invention and
    clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we
    have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall
    to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.

First Lord

    We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
    him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:
    when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a
    sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this
    very night.

Second Lord

    I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.

BERTRAM

    Your brother he shall go along with me.

Second Lord

    As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.

    Exit

BERTRAM

    Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
    The lass I spoke of.

First Lord

    But you say she's honest.

BERTRAM

    That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once
    And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
    By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,
    Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
    And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:
    Will you go see her?

First Lord

    With all my heart, my lord.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. Florence. The Widow's house.

    Enter HELENA and Widow

HELENA

    If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
    I know not how I shall assure you further,
    But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.

Widow

    Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,
    Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
    And would not put my reputation now
    In any staining act.

HELENA

    Nor would I wish you.
    First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,
    And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
    Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
    By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
    Err in bestowing it.

Widow

    I should believe you:
    For you have show'd me that which well approves
    You're great in fortune.

HELENA

    Take this purse of gold,
    And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
    Which I will over-pay and pay again
    When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,
    Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
    Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,
    As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
    Now his important blood will nought deny
    That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,
    That downward hath succeeded in his house
    From son to son, some four or five descents
    Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
    In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,
    To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
    Howe'er repented after.

Widow

    Now I see
    The bottom of your purpose.

HELENA

    You see it lawful, then: it is no more,
    But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
    Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
    In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
    Herself most chastely absent: after this,
    To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
    To what is passed already.

Widow

    I have yielded:
    Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
    That time and place with this deceit so lawful
    May prove coherent. Every night he comes
    With musics of all sorts and songs composed
    To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
    To chide him from our eaves; for he persists
    As if his life lay on't.

HELENA

    Why then to-night
    Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
    Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
    And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
    Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:
    But let's about it.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Without the Florentine camp.

    Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other Soldiers in ambush

Second Lord

    He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
    When you sally upon him, speak what terrible
    language you will: though you understand it not
    yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to
    understand him, unless some one among us whom we
    must produce for an interpreter.

First Soldier

    Good captain, let me be the interpreter.

Second Lord

    Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?

First Soldier

    No, sir, I warrant you.

Second Lord

    But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?

First Soldier

    E'en such as you speak to me.

Second Lord

    He must think us some band of strangers i' the
    adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of
    all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every
    one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we
    speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to
    know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
    gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,
    interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,
    ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,
    and then to return and swear the lies he forges.

    Enter PAROLLES

PAROLLES

    Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be
    time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
    done? It must be a very plausive invention that
    carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces
    have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
    my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the
    fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not
    daring the reports of my tongue.

Second Lord

    This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
    was guilty of.

PAROLLES

    What the devil should move me to undertake the
    recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the
    impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
    must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in
    exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they
    will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great
    ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the
    instance? Tongue, I must put you into a
    butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of
    Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.

Second Lord

    Is it possible he should know what he is, and be
    that he is?

PAROLLES

    I would the cutting of my garments would serve the
    turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.

Second Lord

    We cannot afford you so.

PAROLLES

    Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
    stratagem.

Second Lord

    'Twould not do.

PAROLLES

    Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.

Second Lord

    Hardly serve.

PAROLLES

    Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.

Second Lord

    How deep?

PAROLLES

    Thirty fathom.

Second Lord

    Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.

PAROLLES

    I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear
    I recovered it.

Second Lord

    You shall hear one anon.

PAROLLES

    A drum now of the enemy's,--

    Alarum within

Second Lord

    Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.

All

    Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.

PAROLLES

    O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.

    They seize and blindfold him

First Soldier

    Boskos thromuldo boskos.

PAROLLES

    I know you are the Muskos' regiment:
    And I shall lose my life for want of language;
    If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,
    Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll
    Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.

First Soldier

    Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak
    thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy
    faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.

PAROLLES

    O!

First Soldier

    O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.

Second Lord

    Oscorbidulchos volivorco.

First Soldier

    The general is content to spare thee yet;
    And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
    To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform
    Something to save thy life.

PAROLLES

    O, let me live!
    And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
    Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that
    Which you will wonder at.

First Soldier

    But wilt thou faithfully?

PAROLLES

    If I do not, damn me.

First Soldier

    Acordo linta.
    Come on; thou art granted space.

    Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within

Second Lord

    Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,
    We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
    Till we do hear from them.

Second Soldier

    Captain, I will.

Second Lord

    A' will betray us all unto ourselves:
    Inform on that.

Second Soldier

    So I will, sir.

Second Lord

    Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Florence. The Widow's house.

    Enter BERTRAM and DIANA

BERTRAM

    They told me that your name was Fontibell.

DIANA

    No, my good lord, Diana.

BERTRAM

    Titled goddess;
    And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
    In your fine frame hath love no quality?
    If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
    You are no maiden, but a monument:
    When you are dead, you should be such a one
    As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
    And now you should be as your mother was
    When your sweet self was got.

DIANA

    She then was honest.

BERTRAM

    So should you be.

DIANA

    No:
    My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
    As you owe to your wife.

BERTRAM

    No more o' that;
    I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
    I was compell'd to her; but I love thee
    By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
    Do thee all rights of service.

DIANA

    Ay, so you serve us
    Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
    You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
    And mock us with our bareness.

BERTRAM

    How have I sworn!

DIANA

    'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
    But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
    What is not holy, that we swear not by,
    But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
    If I should swear by God's great attributes,
    I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
    When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
    To swear by him whom I protest to love,
    That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
    Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,
    At least in my opinion.

BERTRAM

    Change it, change it;
    Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;
    And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
    That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
    But give thyself unto my sick desires,
    Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever
    My love as it begins shall so persever.

DIANA

    I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
    That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.

BERTRAM

    I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power
    To give it from me.

DIANA

    Will you not, my lord?

BERTRAM

    It is an honour 'longing to our house,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
    In me to lose.

DIANA

    Mine honour's such a ring:
    My chastity's the jewel of our house,
    Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
    Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
    In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
    Brings in the champion Honour on my part,
    Against your vain assault.

BERTRAM

    Here, take my ring:
    My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
    And I'll be bid by thee.

DIANA

    When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:
    I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
    Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
    When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
    Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
    My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
    When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:
    And on your finger in the night I'll put
    Another ring, that what in time proceeds
    May token to the future our past deeds.
    Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won
    A wife of me, though there my hope be done.

BERTRAM

    A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.

    Exit

DIANA

    For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
    You may so in the end.
    My mother told me just how he would woo,
    As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men
    Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me
    When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
    When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
    Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
    Only in this disguise I think't no sin
    To cozen him that would unjustly win.

    Exit

SCENE III. The Florentine camp.

    Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers

First Lord

    You have not given him his mother's letter?

Second Lord

    I have delivered it an hour since: there is
    something in't that stings his nature; for on the
    reading it he changed almost into another man.

First Lord

    He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
    off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.

Second Lord

    Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
    displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his
    bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a
    thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.

First Lord

    When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the
    grave of it.

Second Lord

    He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
    Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he
    fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
    given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself
    made in the unchaste composition.

First Lord

    Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,
    what things are we!

Second Lord

    Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
    of all treasons, we still see them reveal
    themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,
    so he that in this action contrives against his own
    nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.

First Lord

    Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of
    our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
    company to-night?

Second Lord

    Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.

First Lord

    That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see
    his company anatomized, that he might take a measure
    of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had
    set this counterfeit.

Second Lord

    We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
    presence must be the whip of the other.

First Lord

    In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?

Second Lord

    I hear there is an overture of peace.

First Lord

    Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.

Second Lord

    What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel
    higher, or return again into France?

First Lord

    I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
    of his council.

Second Lord

    Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal
    of his act.

First Lord

    Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his
    house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
    le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere
    sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the
    tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
    grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and
    now she sings in heaven.

Second Lord

    How is this justified?

First Lord

    The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
    makes her story true, even to the point of her
    death: her death itself, which could not be her
    office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
    the rector of the place.

Second Lord

    Hath the count all this intelligence?

First Lord

    Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
    point, so to the full arming of the verity.

Second Lord

    I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.

First Lord

    How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!

Second Lord

    And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
    in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
    here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
    with a shame as ample.

First Lord

    The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and
    ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our
    faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
    despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.

    Enter a Messenger
    How now! where's your master?

Servant

    He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath
    taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next
    morning for France. The duke hath offered him
    letters of commendations to the king.

Second Lord

    They shall be no more than needful there, if they
    were more than they can commend.

First Lord

    They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
    Here's his lordship now.

    Enter BERTRAM
    How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?

BERTRAM

    I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
    month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:
    I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
    nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my
    lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
    and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
    many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but
    that I have not ended yet.

Second Lord

    If the business be of any difficulty, and this
    morning your departure hence, it requires haste of
    your lordship.

BERTRAM

    I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
    hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
    dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
    bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
    me, like a double-meaning prophesier.

Second Lord

    Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,
    poor gallant knave.

BERTRAM

    No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
    his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?

Second Lord

    I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry
    him. But to answer you as you would be understood;
    he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he
    hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes
    to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to
    this very instant disaster of his setting i' the
    stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?

BERTRAM

    Nothing of me, has a'?

Second Lord

    His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
    face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you
    are, you must have the patience to hear it.

    Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier

BERTRAM

    A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of
    me: hush, hush!

First Lord

    Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa

First Soldier

    He calls for the tortures: what will you say
    without 'em?

PAROLLES

    I will confess what I know without constraint: if
    ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.

First Soldier

    Bosko chimurcho.

First Lord

    Boblibindo chicurmurco.

First Soldier

    You are a merciful general. Our general bids you
    answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.

PAROLLES

    And truly, as I hope to live.

First Soldier

    [Reads] 'First demand of him how many horse the
    duke is strong.' What say you to that?

PAROLLES

    Five or six thousand; but very weak and
    unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and
    the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation
    and credit and as I hope to live.

First Soldier

    Shall I set down your answer so?

PAROLLES

    Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.

BERTRAM

    All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!

First Lord

    You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur
    Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own
    phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the
    knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of
    his dagger.

Second Lord

    I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
    clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him
    by wearing his apparel neatly.

First Soldier

    Well, that's set down.

PAROLLES

    Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say
    true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.

First Lord

    He's very near the truth in this.

BERTRAM

    But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he
    delivers it.

PAROLLES

    Poor rogues, I pray you, say.

First Soldier

    Well, that's set down.

PAROLLES

    I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the
    rogues are marvellous poor.

First Soldier

    [Reads] 'Demand of him, of what strength they are
    a-foot.' What say you to that?

PAROLLES

    By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
    hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a
    hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so
    many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
    and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own
    company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and
    fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and
    sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
    poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off
    their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.

BERTRAM

    What shall be done to him?

First Lord

    Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
    condition, and what credit I have with the duke.

First Soldier

    Well, that's set down.

    Reads
    'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain
    be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is
    with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and
    expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not
    possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to
    corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what
    do you know of it?

PAROLLES

    I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of
    the inter'gatories: demand them singly.

First Soldier

    Do you know this Captain Dumain?

PAROLLES

    I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,
    from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
    fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not
    say him nay.

BERTRAM

    Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know
    his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.

First Soldier

    Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?

PAROLLES

    Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.

First Lord

    Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
    lordship anon.

First Soldier

    What is his reputation with the duke?

PAROLLES

    The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
    of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him
    out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.

First Soldier

    Marry, we'll search.

PAROLLES

    In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,
    or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
    in my tent.

First Soldier

    Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?

PAROLLES

    I do not know if it be it or no.

BERTRAM

    Our interpreter does it well.

First Lord

    Excellently.

First Soldier

    [Reads] 'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--

PAROLLES

    That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an
    advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
    Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
    Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
    ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.

First Soldier

    Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.

PAROLLES

    My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the
    behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be
    a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to
    virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.

BERTRAM

    Damnable both-sides rogue!

First Soldier

    [Reads] 'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
    After he scores, he never pays the score:
    Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
    He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;
    And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
    Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
    For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,
    Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
    Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
    PAROLLES.'

BERTRAM

    He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
    in's forehead.

Second Lord

    This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
    linguist and the armipotent soldier.

BERTRAM

    I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now
    he's a cat to me.

First Soldier

    I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be
    fain to hang you.

PAROLLES

    My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to
    die; but that, my offences being many, I would
    repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,
    sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.

First Soldier

    We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
    therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you
    have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
    his valour: what is his honesty?

PAROLLES

    He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
    rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
    professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he
    is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
    such volubility, that you would think truth were a
    fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
    be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little
    harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they
    know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
    little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
    every thing that an honest man should not have; what
    an honest man should have, he has nothing.

First Lord

    I begin to love him for this.

BERTRAM

    For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
    him for me, he's more and more a cat.

First Soldier

    What say you to his expertness in war?

PAROLLES

    Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English
    tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of
    his soldiership I know not; except, in that country
    he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
    called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of
    files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
    this I am not certain.

First Lord

    He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
    rarity redeems him.

BERTRAM

    A pox on him, he's a cat still.

First Soldier

    His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
    to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.

PAROLLES

    Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple
    of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the
    entail from all remainders, and a perpetual
    succession for it perpetually.

First Soldier

    What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?

Second Lord

    Why does be ask him of me?

First Soldier

    What's he?

PAROLLES

    E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so
    great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
    deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,
    yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:
    in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming
    on he has the cramp.

First Soldier

    If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
    the Florentine?

PAROLLES

    Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.

First Soldier

    I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.

PAROLLES

    [Aside] I'll no more drumming; a plague of all
    drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to
    beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
    the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
    would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?

First Soldier

    There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the
    general says, you that have so traitorously
    discovered the secrets of your army and made such
    pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can
    serve the world for no honest use; therefore you
    must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.

PAROLLES

    O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!

First Lord

    That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.

    Unblinding him
    So, look about you: know you any here?

BERTRAM

    Good morrow, noble captain.

Second Lord

    God bless you, Captain Parolles.

First Lord

    God save you, noble captain.

Second Lord

    Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?
    I am for France.

First Lord

    Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
    you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?
    an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you:
    but fare you well.

    Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords

First Soldier

    You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that
    has a knot on't yet

PAROLLES

    Who cannot be crushed with a plot?

First Soldier

    If you could find out a country where but women were
    that had received so much shame, you might begin an
    impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France
    too: we shall speak of you there.

    Exit with Soldiers

PAROLLES

    Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,
    'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
    But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
    As captain shall: simply the thing I am
    Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
    Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
    that every braggart shall be found an ass.
    Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
    Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!
    There's place and means for every man alive.
    I'll after them.

    Exit

SCENE IV. Florence. The Widow's house.

    Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA

HELENA

    That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,
    One of the greatest in the Christian world
    Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,
    Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
    Time was, I did him a desired office,
    Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
    Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
    And answer, thanks: I duly am inform'd
    His grace is at Marseilles; to which place
    We have convenient convoy. You must know
    I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
    My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
    And by the leave of my good lord the king,
    We'll be before our welcome.

Widow

    Gentle madam,
    You never had a servant to whose trust
    Your business was more welcome.

HELENA

    Nor you, mistress,
    Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
    To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven
    Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
    As it hath fated her to be my motive
    And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
    That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
    When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
    Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play
    With what it loathes for that which is away.
    But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
    Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
    Something in my behalf.

DIANA

    Let death and honesty
    Go with your impositions, I am yours
    Upon your will to suffer.

HELENA

    Yet, I pray you:
    But with the word the time will bring on summer,
    When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,
    And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;
    Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:
    All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;
    Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown

LAFEU

    No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
    fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have
    made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
    his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
    this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
    by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.

COUNTESS

    I would I had not known him; it was the death of the
    most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
    praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
    flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
    could not have owed her a more rooted love.

LAFEU

    'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a
    thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.

Clown

    Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
    salad, or rather, the herb of grace.

LAFEU

    They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.

Clown

    I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much
    skill in grass.

LAFEU

    Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?

Clown

    A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.

LAFEU

    Your distinction?

Clown

    I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.

LAFEU

    So you were a knave at his service, indeed.

Clown

    And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.

LAFEU

    I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.

Clown

    At your service.

LAFEU

    No, no, no.

Clown

    Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
    great a prince as you are.

LAFEU

    Who's that? a Frenchman?

Clown

    Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy
    is more hotter in France than there.

LAFEU

    What prince is that?

Clown

    The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
    darkness; alias, the devil.

LAFEU

    Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
    to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;
    serve him still.

Clown

    I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
    great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a
    good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
    world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for
    the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
    too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
    themselves may; but the many will be too chill and
    tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that
    leads to the broad gate and the great fire.

LAFEU

    Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I
    tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
    with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well
    looked to, without any tricks.

Clown

    If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
    jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.

    Exit

LAFEU

    A shrewd knave and an unhappy.

COUNTESS

    So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much
    sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
    which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,
    indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.

LAFEU

    I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to
    tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and
    that my lord your son was upon his return home, I
    moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
    my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,
    his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did
    first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
    it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath
    conceived against your son, there is no fitter
    matter. How does your ladyship like it?

COUNTESS

    With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
    happily effected.

LAFEU

    His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able
    body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here
    to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such
    intelligence hath seldom failed.

COUNTESS

    It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
    die. I have letters that my son will be here
    to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
    with me till they meet together.

LAFEU

    Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
    safely be admitted.

COUNTESS

    You need but plead your honourable privilege.

LAFEU

    Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I
    thank my God it holds yet.

    Re-enter Clown

Clown

    O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
    velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't
    or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of
    velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
    half, but his right cheek is worn bare.

LAFEU

    A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery
    of honour; so belike is that.

Clown

    But it is your carbonadoed face.

LAFEU

    Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk
    with the young noble soldier.

Clown

    Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
    hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head
    and nod at every man.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Marseilles. A street.

    Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA, with two Attendants

HELENA

    But this exceeding posting day and night
    Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:
    But since you have made the days and nights as one,
    To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
    Be bold you do so grow in my requital
    As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;

    Enter a Gentleman
    This man may help me to his majesty's ear,
    If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.

Gentleman

    And you.

HELENA

    Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.

Gentleman

    I have been sometimes there.

HELENA

    I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen
    From the report that goes upon your goodness;
    An therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
    Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
    The use of your own virtues, for the which
    I shall continue thankful.

Gentleman

    What's your will?

HELENA

    That it will please you
    To give this poor petition to the king,
    And aid me with that store of power you have
    To come into his presence.

Gentleman

    The king's not here.

HELENA

    Not here, sir!

Gentleman

    Not, indeed:
    He hence removed last night and with more haste
    Than is his use.

Widow

    Lord, how we lose our pains!

HELENA

    ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL yet,
    Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
    I do beseech you, whither is he gone?

Gentleman

    Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
    Whither I am going.

HELENA

    I do beseech you, sir,
    Since you are like to see the king before me,
    Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
    Which I presume shall render you no blame
    But rather make you thank your pains for it.
    I will come after you with what good speed
    Our means will make us means.

Gentleman

    This I'll do for you.

HELENA

    And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
    Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again.
    Go, go, provide.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Rousillon. Before the COUNT's palace.

    Enter Clown, and PAROLLES, following

PAROLLES

    Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this
    letter: I have ere now, sir, been better known to
    you, when I have held familiarity with fresher
    clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's
    mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong
    displeasure.

Clown

    Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it
    smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will
    henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.
    Prithee, allow the wind.

PAROLLES

    Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake
    but by a metaphor.

Clown

    Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my
    nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get
    thee further.

PAROLLES

    Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.

Clown

    Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's
    close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he
    comes himself.

    Enter LAFEU
    Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's
    cat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into the
    unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he
    says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the
    carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
    ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his
    distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to
    your lordship.

    Exit

PAROLLES

    My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly
    scratched.

LAFEU

    And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to
    pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the
    knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
    of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves
    thrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for
    you: let the justices make you and fortune friends:
    I am for other business.

PAROLLES

    I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.

LAFEU

    You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;
    save your word.

PAROLLES

    My name, my good lord, is Parolles.

LAFEU

    You beg more than 'word,' then. Cox my passion!
    give me your hand. How does your drum?

PAROLLES

    O my good lord, you were the first that found me!

LAFEU

    Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.

PAROLLES

    It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,
    for you did bring me out.

LAFEU

    Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once
    both the office of God and the devil? One brings
    thee in grace and the other brings thee out.

    Trumpets sound
    The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,
    inquire further after me; I had talk of you last
    night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall
    eat; go to, follow.

PAROLLES

    I praise God for you.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.

    Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two French Lords, with Attendants

KING

    We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem
    Was made much poorer by it: but your son,
    As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
    Her estimation home.

COUNTESS

    'Tis past, my liege;
    And I beseech your majesty to make it
    Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;
    When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
    O'erbears it and burns on.

KING

    My honour'd lady,
    I have forgiven and forgotten all;
    Though my revenges were high bent upon him,
    And watch'd the time to shoot.

LAFEU

    This I must say,
    But first I beg my pardon, the young lord
    Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady
    Offence of mighty note; but to himself
    The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
    Whose beauty did astonish the survey
    Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
    Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
    Humbly call'd mistress.

KING

    Praising what is lost
    Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
    We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill
    All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;
    The nature of his great offence is dead,
    And deeper than oblivion we do bury
    The incensing relics of it: let him approach,
    A stranger, no offender; and inform him
    So 'tis our will he should.

Gentleman

    I shall, my liege.

    Exit

KING

    What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?

LAFEU

    All that he is hath reference to your highness.

KING

    Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
    That set him high in fame.

    Enter BERTRAM

LAFEU

    He looks well on't.

KING

    I am not a day of season,
    For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
    In me at once: but to the brightest beams
    Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
    The time is fair again.

BERTRAM

    My high-repented blames,
    Dear sovereign, pardon to me.

KING

    All is whole;
    Not one word more of the consumed time.
    Let's take the instant by the forward top;
    For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
    The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
    Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
    The daughter of this lord?

BERTRAM

    Admiringly, my liege, at first
    I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
    Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
    Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
    Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
    Which warp'd the line of every other favour;
    Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;
    Extended or contracted all proportions
    To a most hideous object: thence it came
    That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
    Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
    The dust that did offend it.

KING

    Well excused:
    That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
    From the great compt: but love that comes too late,
    Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
    To the great sender turns a sour offence,
    Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
    Make trivial price of serious things we have,
    Not knowing them until we know their grave:
    Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
    Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
    Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
    While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
    Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
    Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
    The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
    To see our widower's second marriage-day.

COUNTESS

    Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
    Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!

LAFEU

    Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
    Must be digested, give a favour from you
    To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
    That she may quickly come.

    BERTRAM gives a ring
    By my old beard,
    And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,
    Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
    The last that e'er I took her at court,
    I saw upon her finger.

BERTRAM

    Hers it was not.

KING

    Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
    While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
    This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
    I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
    Necessitied to help, that by this token
    I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
    her
    Of what should stead her most?

BERTRAM

    My gracious sovereign,
    Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
    The ring was never hers.

COUNTESS

    Son, on my life,
    I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
    At her life's rate.

LAFEU

    I am sure I saw her wear it.

BERTRAM

    You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:
    In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
    Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
    Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
    I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
    To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
    I could not answer in that course of honour
    As she had made the overture, she ceased
    In heavy satisfaction and would never
    Receive the ring again.

KING

    Plutus himself,
    That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
    Hath not in nature's mystery more science
    Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
    Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
    That you are well acquainted with yourself,
    Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
    You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety
    That she would never put it from her finger,
    Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
    Where you have never come, or sent it us
    Upon her great disaster.

BERTRAM

    She never saw it.

KING

    Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
    And makest conjectural fears to come into me
    Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
    That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--
    And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
    And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
    Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
    More than to see this ring. Take him away.

    Guards seize BERTRAM
    My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
    Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
    Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!
    We'll sift this matter further.

BERTRAM

    If you shall prove
    This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
    Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
    Where yet she never was.

    Exit, guarded

KING

    I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.

    Enter a Gentleman

Gentleman

    Gracious sovereign,
    Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
    Here's a petition from a Florentine,
    Who hath for four or five removes come short
    To tender it herself. I undertook it,
    Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
    Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
    Is here attending: her business looks in her
    With an importing visage; and she told me,
    In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
    Your highness with herself.

KING

    [Reads] Upon his many protestations to marry me
    when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won
    me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows
    are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He
    stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow
    him to his country for justice: grant it me, O
    king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer
    flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
    DIANA CAPILET.

LAFEU

    I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for
    this: I'll none of him.

KING

    The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,
    To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:
    Go speedily and bring again the count.
    I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
    Was foully snatch'd.

COUNTESS

    Now, justice on the doers!

    Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded

KING

    I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,
    And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
    Yet you desire to marry.

    Enter Widow and DIANA
    What woman's that?

DIANA

    I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
    Derived from the ancient Capilet:
    My suit, as I do understand, you know,
    And therefore know how far I may be pitied.

Widow

    I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
    Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
    And both shall cease, without your remedy.

KING

    Come hither, count; do you know these women?

BERTRAM

    My lord, I neither can nor will deny
    But that I know them: do they charge me further?

DIANA

    Why do you look so strange upon your wife?

BERTRAM

    She's none of mine, my lord.

DIANA

    If you shall marry,
    You give away this hand, and that is mine;
    You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
    You give away myself, which is known mine;
    For I by vow am so embodied yours,
    That she which marries you must marry me,
    Either both or none.

LAFEU

    Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you
    are no husband for her.

BERTRAM

    My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
    Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness
    Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
    Than for to think that I would sink it here.

KING

    Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
    Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
    Than in my thought it lies.

DIANA

    Good my lord,
    Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
    He had not my virginity.

KING

    What say'st thou to her?

BERTRAM

    She's impudent, my lord,
    And was a common gamester to the camp.

DIANA

    He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
    He might have bought me at a common price:
    Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
    Whose high respect and rich validity
    Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
    He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
    If I be one.

COUNTESS

    He blushes, and 'tis it:
    Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
    Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,
    Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
    That ring's a thousand proofs.

KING

    Methought you said
    You saw one here in court could witness it.

DIANA

    I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
    So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.

LAFEU

    I saw the man to-day, if man he be.

KING

    Find him, and bring him hither.

    Exit an Attendant

BERTRAM

    What of him?
    He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
    With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;
    Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
    Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
    That will speak any thing?

KING

    She hath that ring of yours.

BERTRAM

    I think she has: certain it is I liked her,
    And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:
    She knew her distance and did angle for me,
    Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
    As all impediments in fancy's course
    Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
    Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
    Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
    And I had that which any inferior might
    At market-price have bought.

DIANA

    I must be patient:
    You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
    May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
    Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
    Send for your ring, I will return it home,
    And give me mine again.

BERTRAM

    I have it not.

KING

    What ring was yours, I pray you?

DIANA

    Sir, much like
    The same upon your finger.

KING

    Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.

DIANA

    And this was it I gave him, being abed.

KING

    The story then goes false, you threw it him
    Out of a casement.

DIANA

    I have spoke the truth.

    Enter PAROLLES

BERTRAM

    My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.

KING

    You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
    Is this the man you speak of?

DIANA

    Ay, my lord.

KING

    Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,
    Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
    Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,
    By him and by this woman here what know you?

PAROLLES

    So please your majesty, my master hath been an
    honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,
    which gentlemen have.

KING

    Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?

PAROLLES

    Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?

KING

    How, I pray you?

PAROLLES

    He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.

KING

    How is that?

PAROLLES

    He loved her, sir, and loved her not.

KING

    As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
    equivocal companion is this!

PAROLLES

    I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.

LAFEU

    He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.

DIANA

    Do you know he promised me marriage?

PAROLLES

    Faith, I know more than I'll speak.

KING

    But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?

PAROLLES

    Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,
    as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for
    indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and
    of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
    was in that credit with them at that time that I
    knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,
    as promising her marriage, and things which would
    derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not
    speak what I know.

KING

    Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say
    they are married: but thou art too fine in thy
    evidence; therefore stand aside.
    This ring, you say, was yours?

DIANA

    Ay, my good lord.

KING

    Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?

DIANA

    It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.

KING

    Who lent it you?

DIANA

    It was not lent me neither.

KING

    Where did you find it, then?

DIANA

    I found it not.

KING

    If it were yours by none of all these ways,
    How could you give it him?

DIANA

    I never gave it him.

LAFEU

    This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off
    and on at pleasure.

KING

    This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.

DIANA

    It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.

KING

    Take her away; I do not like her now;
    To prison with her: and away with him.
    Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
    Thou diest within this hour.

DIANA

    I'll never tell you.

KING

    Take her away.

DIANA

    I'll put in bail, my liege.

KING

    I think thee now some common customer.

DIANA

    By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.

KING

    Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?

DIANA

    Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:
    He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
    I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
    Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
    I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.

KING

    She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.

DIANA

    Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:

    Exit Widow
    The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
    And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
    Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
    Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:
    He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
    And at that time he got his wife with child:
    Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
    So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
    And now behold the meaning.

    Re-enter Widow, with HELENA

KING

    Is there no exorcist
    Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
    Is't real that I see?

HELENA

    No, my good lord;
    'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
    The name and not the thing.

BERTRAM

    Both, both. O, pardon!

HELENA

    O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
    I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
    And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
    'When from my finger you can get this ring
    And are by me with child,' & c. This is done:
    Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?

BERTRAM

    If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
    I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.

HELENA

    If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
    Deadly divorce step between me and you!
    O my dear mother, do I see you living?

LAFEU

    Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:

    To PAROLLES
    Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
    I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:
    Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.

KING

    Let us from point to point this story know,
    To make the even truth in pleasure flow.

    To DIANA
    If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
    Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
    For I can guess that by thy honest aid
    Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
    Of that and all the progress, more or less,
    Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
    All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
    The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.

    EPILOGUE

KING

    The king's a beggar, now the play is done:
    All is well ended, if this suit be won,
    That you express content; which we will pay,
    With strife to please you, day exceeding day:
    Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
    Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.

As You Like It

ACT I
SCENE I. Orchard of Oliver's house.

    Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

ORLANDO

    As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
    bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
    and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
    blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
    sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
    he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
    properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
    that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
    differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
    are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
    with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
    and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
    brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
    which his animals on his dunghills are as much
    bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
    plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
    me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
    me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
    gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
    grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
    think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
    servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
    know no wise remedy how to avoid it.

ADAM

    Yonder comes my master, your brother.

ORLANDO

    Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
    shake me up.

    Enter OLIVER

OLIVER

    Now, sir! what make you here?

ORLANDO

    Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.

OLIVER

    What mar you then, sir?

ORLANDO

    Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
    made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.

OLIVER

    Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.

ORLANDO

    Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
    What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
    come to such penury?

OLIVER

    Know you where your are, sir?

ORLANDO

    O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.

OLIVER

    Know you before whom, sir?

ORLANDO

    Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
    you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
    condition of blood, you should so know me. The
    courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
    you are the first-born; but the same tradition
    takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
    betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
    you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
    nearer to his reverence.

OLIVER

    What, boy!

ORLANDO

    Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.

OLIVER

    Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?

ORLANDO

    I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
    Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
    a villain that says such a father begot villains.
    Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
    from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
    tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.

ADAM

    Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
    remembrance, be at accord.

OLIVER

    Let me go, I say.

ORLANDO

    I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
    father charged you in his will to give me good
    education: you have trained me like a peasant,
    obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
    qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
    me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
    me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
    give me the poor allottery my father left me by
    testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.

OLIVER

    And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
    Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
    with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
    pray you, leave me.

ORLANDO

    I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.

OLIVER

    Get you with him, you old dog.

ADAM

    Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
    teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
    he would not have spoke such a word.

    Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM

OLIVER

    Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
    physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
    crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!

    Enter DENNIS

DENNIS

    Calls your worship?

OLIVER

    Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?

DENNIS

    So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
    access to you.

OLIVER

    Call him in.

    Exit DENNIS
    'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.

    Enter CHARLES

CHARLES

    Good morrow to your worship.

OLIVER

    Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
    new court?

CHARLES

    There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
    that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
    brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
    have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
    whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
    therefore he gives them good leave to wander.

OLIVER

    Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
    banished with her father?

CHARLES

    O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
    her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
    that she would have followed her exile, or have died
    to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
    less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
    never two ladies loved as they do.

OLIVER

    Where will the old duke live?

CHARLES

    They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
    a many merry men with him; and there they live like
    the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
    gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
    carelessly, as they did in the golden world.

OLIVER

    What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?

CHARLES

    Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
    matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
    that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
    to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
    To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
    escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
    well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
    for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
    must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
    out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
    withal, that either you might stay him from his
    intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
    run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
    and altogether against my will.

OLIVER

    Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
    thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
    myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
    have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
    it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
    it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
    of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
    good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
    me his natural brother: therefore use thy
    discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
    as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
    thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
    mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
    against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
    treacherous device and never leave thee till he
    hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
    for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
    it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
    day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
    should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
    blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.

CHARLES

    I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
    to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
    alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
    so God keep your worship!

OLIVER

    Farewell, good Charles.

    Exit CHARLES
    Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
    an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
    hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
    schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
    all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
    in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
    people, who best know him, that I am altogether
    misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
    wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
    I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.

    Exit

SCENE II. Lawn before the Duke's palace.

    Enter CELIA and ROSALIND

CELIA

    I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

ROSALIND

    Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
    and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
    teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
    learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.

CELIA

    Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
    that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
    had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
    hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
    love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
    if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
    tempered as mine is to thee.

ROSALIND

    Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
    rejoice in yours.

CELIA

    You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
    like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
    be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
    father perforce, I will render thee again in
    affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
    that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
    sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.

ROSALIND

    From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
    me see; what think you of falling in love?

CELIA

    Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
    love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
    neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
    in honour come off again.

ROSALIND

    What shall be our sport, then?

CELIA

    Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
    her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.

ROSALIND

    I would we could do so, for her benefits are
    mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
    doth most mistake in her gifts to women.

CELIA

    'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
    makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
    makes very ill-favouredly.

ROSALIND

    Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
    Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
    not in the lineaments of Nature.

    Enter TOUCHSTONE

CELIA

    No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
    not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
    hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
    Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?

ROSALIND

    Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
    Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
    Nature's wit.

CELIA

    Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
    Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
    to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
    natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
    the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
    wit! whither wander you?

TOUCHSTONE

    Mistress, you must come away to your father.

CELIA

    Were you made the messenger?

TOUCHSTONE

    No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.

ROSALIND

    Where learned you that oath, fool?

TOUCHSTONE

    Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
    were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
    mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
    pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
    yet was not the knight forsworn.

CELIA

    How prove you that, in the great heap of your
    knowledge?

ROSALIND

    Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

TOUCHSTONE

    Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
    swear by your beards that I am a knave.

CELIA

    By our beards, if we had them, thou art.

TOUCHSTONE

    By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
    swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
    more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
    never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
    before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.

CELIA

    Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?

TOUCHSTONE

    One that old Frederick, your father, loves.

CELIA

    My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
    speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
    one of these days.

TOUCHSTONE

    The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
    wise men do foolishly.

CELIA

    By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
    wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
    that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
    Monsieur Le Beau.

ROSALIND

    With his mouth full of news.

CELIA

    Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.

ROSALIND

    Then shall we be news-crammed.

CELIA

    All the better; we shall be the more marketable.

    Enter LE BEAU
    Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?

LE BEAU

    Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.

CELIA

    Sport! of what colour?

LE BEAU

    What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?

ROSALIND

    As wit and fortune will.

TOUCHSTONE

    Or as the Destinies decree.

CELIA

    Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.

TOUCHSTONE

    Nay, if I keep not my rank,--

ROSALIND

    Thou losest thy old smell.

LE BEAU

    You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
    wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.

ROSALIND

    You tell us the manner of the wrestling.

LE BEAU

    I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
    your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
    yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
    to perform it.

CELIA

    Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

LE BEAU

    There comes an old man and his three sons,--

CELIA

    I could match this beginning with an old tale.

LE BEAU

    Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.

ROSALIND

    With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
    by these presents.'

LE BEAU

    The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
    duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
    and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
    hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
    so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
    their father, making such pitiful dole over them
    that all the beholders take his part with weeping.

ROSALIND

    Alas!

TOUCHSTONE

    But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
    have lost?

LE BEAU

    Why, this that I speak of.

TOUCHSTONE

    Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
    time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
    for ladies.

CELIA

    Or I, I promise thee.

ROSALIND

    But is there any else longs to see this broken music
    in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
    rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?

LE BEAU

    You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
    perform it.

CELIA

    Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.

    Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO, CHARLES, and Attendants

DUKE FREDERICK

    Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
    own peril on his forwardness.

ROSALIND

    Is yonder the man?

LE BEAU

    Even he, madam.

CELIA

    Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.

DUKE FREDERICK

    How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
    to see the wrestling?

ROSALIND

    Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.

DUKE FREDERICK

    You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
    there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
    challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
    will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
    you can move him.

CELIA

    Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Do so: I'll not be by.

LE BEAU

    Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.

ORLANDO

    I attend them with all respect and duty.

ROSALIND

    Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?

ORLANDO

    No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I
    come but in, as others do, to try with him the
    strength of my youth.

CELIA

    Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
    years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
    strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
    knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
    adventure would counsel you to a more equal
    enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
    embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.

ROSALIND

    Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore
    be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
    that the wrestling might not go forward.

ORLANDO

    I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
    thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
    so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
    your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
    trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
    shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
    dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
    friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
    world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
    the world I fill up a place, which may be better
    supplied when I have made it empty.

ROSALIND

    The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.

CELIA

    And mine, to eke out hers.

ROSALIND

    Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!

CELIA

    Your heart's desires be with you!

CHARLES

    Come, where is this young gallant that is so
    desirous to lie with his mother earth?

ORLANDO

    Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.

DUKE FREDERICK

    You shall try but one fall.

CHARLES

    No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
    to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
    from a first.

ORLANDO

    An you mean to mock me after, you should not have
    mocked me before: but come your ways.

ROSALIND

    Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!

CELIA

    I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
    fellow by the leg.

    They wrestle

ROSALIND

    O excellent young man!

CELIA

    If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
    should down.

    Shout. CHARLES is thrown

DUKE FREDERICK

    No more, no more.

ORLANDO

    Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.

DUKE FREDERICK

    How dost thou, Charles?

LE BEAU

    He cannot speak, my lord.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?

ORLANDO

    Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.

DUKE FREDERICK

    I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
    The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
    But I did find him still mine enemy:
    Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
    Hadst thou descended from another house.
    But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
    I would thou hadst told me of another father.

    Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU

CELIA

    Were I my father, coz, would I do this?

ORLANDO

    I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
    His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
    To be adopted heir to Frederick.

ROSALIND

    My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
    And all the world was of my father's mind:
    Had I before known this young man his son,
    I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
    Ere he should thus have ventured.

CELIA

    Gentle cousin,
    Let us go thank him and encourage him:
    My father's rough and envious disposition
    Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
    If you do keep your promises in love
    But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
    Your mistress shall be happy.

ROSALIND

    Gentleman,

    Giving him a chain from her neck
    Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
    That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
    Shall we go, coz?

CELIA

    Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.

ORLANDO

    Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
    Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
    Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.

ROSALIND

    He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
    I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
    Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
    More than your enemies.

CELIA

    Will you go, coz?

ROSALIND

    Have with you. Fare you well.

    Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA

ORLANDO

    What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
    I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
    O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
    Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.

    Re-enter LE BEAU

LE BEAU

    Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
    To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
    High commendation, true applause and love,
    Yet such is now the duke's condition
    That he misconstrues all that you have done.
    The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,
    More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.

ORLANDO

    I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:
    Which of the two was daughter of the duke
    That here was at the wrestling?

LE BEAU

    Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
    But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
    The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
    And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
    To keep his daughter company; whose loves
    Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
    But I can tell you that of late this duke
    Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
    Grounded upon no other argument
    But that the people praise her for her virtues
    And pity her for her good father's sake;
    And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
    Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
    Hereafter, in a better world than this,
    I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.

ORLANDO

    I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.

    Exit LE BEAU
    Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
    From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
    But heavenly Rosalind!

    Exit

SCENE III. A room in the palace.

    Enter CELIA and ROSALIND

CELIA

    Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?

ROSALIND

    Not one to throw at a dog.

CELIA

    No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
    curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.

ROSALIND

    Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
    should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
    without any.

CELIA

    But is all this for your father?

ROSALIND

    No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how
    full of briers is this working-day world!

CELIA

    They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
    holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
    paths our very petticoats will catch them.

ROSALIND

    I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.

CELIA

    Hem them away.

ROSALIND

    I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.

CELIA

    Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.

ROSALIND

    O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!

CELIA

    O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
    despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
    service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
    possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
    strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?

ROSALIND

    The duke my father loved his father dearly.

CELIA

    Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
    dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
    for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
    not Orlando.

ROSALIND

    No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.

CELIA

    Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?

ROSALIND

    Let me love him for that, and do you love him
    because I do. Look, here comes the duke.

CELIA

    With his eyes full of anger.

    Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords

DUKE FREDERICK

    Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
    And get you from our court.

ROSALIND

    Me, uncle?

DUKE FREDERICK

    You, cousin
    Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
    So near our public court as twenty miles,
    Thou diest for it.

ROSALIND

    I do beseech your grace,
    Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
    If with myself I hold intelligence
    Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
    If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
    As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
    Never so much as in a thought unborn
    Did I offend your highness.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Thus do all traitors:
    If their purgation did consist in words,
    They are as innocent as grace itself:
    Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.

ROSALIND

    Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
    Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.

ROSALIND

    So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
    So was I when your highness banish'd him:
    Treason is not inherited, my lord;
    Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
    What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
    Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
    To think my poverty is treacherous.

CELIA

    Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
    Else had she with her father ranged along.

CELIA

    I did not then entreat to have her stay;
    It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
    I was too young that time to value her;
    But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
    Why so am I; we still have slept together,
    Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
    And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
    Still we went coupled and inseparable.

DUKE FREDERICK

    She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
    Her very silence and her patience
    Speak to the people, and they pity her.
    Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
    And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
    When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
    Firm and irrevocable is my doom
    Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.

CELIA

    Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
    I cannot live out of her company.

DUKE FREDERICK

    You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
    If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
    And in the greatness of my word, you die.

    Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords

CELIA

    O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
    Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
    I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.

ROSALIND

    I have more cause.

CELIA

    Thou hast not, cousin;
    Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
    Hath banish'd me, his daughter?

ROSALIND

    That he hath not.

CELIA

    No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
    Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
    Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
    No: let my father seek another heir.
    Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
    Whither to go and what to bear with us;
    And do not seek to take your change upon you,
    To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
    For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
    Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.

ROSALIND

    Why, whither shall we go?

CELIA

    To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.

ROSALIND

    Alas, what danger will it be to us,
    Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
    Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.

CELIA

    I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
    And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
    The like do you: so shall we pass along
    And never stir assailants.

ROSALIND

    Were it not better,
    Because that I am more than common tall,
    That I did suit me all points like a man?
    A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
    A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
    Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
    We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
    As many other mannish cowards have
    That do outface it with their semblances.

CELIA

    What shall I call thee when thou art a man?

ROSALIND

    I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
    And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
    But what will you be call'd?

CELIA

    Something that hath a reference to my state
    No longer Celia, but Aliena.

ROSALIND

    But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
    The clownish fool out of your father's court?
    Would he not be a comfort to our travel?

CELIA

    He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
    Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
    And get our jewels and our wealth together,
    Devise the fittest time and safest way
    To hide us from pursuit that will be made
    After my flight. Now go we in content
    To liberty and not to banishment.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. The Forest of Arden.

    Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords, like foresters

DUKE SENIOR

    Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
    Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
    Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
    More free from peril than the envious court?
    Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
    The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
    And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
    Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
    Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
    'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
    That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
    Sweet are the uses of adversity,
    Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
    Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
    And this our life exempt from public haunt
    Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
    Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
    I would not change it.

AMIENS

    Happy is your grace,
    That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
    Into so quiet and so sweet a style.

DUKE SENIOR

    Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
    And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
    Being native burghers of this desert city,
    Should in their own confines with forked heads
    Have their round haunches gored.

First Lord

    Indeed, my lord,
    The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
    And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
    Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
    To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
    Did steal behind him as he lay along
    Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
    Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
    To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
    That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
    Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
    The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
    That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
    Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
    Coursed one another down his innocent nose
    In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
    Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
    Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
    Augmenting it with tears.

DUKE SENIOR

    But what said Jaques?
    Did he not moralize this spectacle?

First Lord

    O, yes, into a thousand similes.
    First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
    'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
    As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
    To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
    Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
    ''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
    The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
    Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
    And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,
    'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
    'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
    Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
    Thus most invectively he pierceth through
    The body of the country, city, court,
    Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
    Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
    To fright the animals and to kill them up
    In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.

DUKE SENIOR

    And did you leave him in this contemplation?

Second Lord

    We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
    Upon the sobbing deer.

DUKE SENIOR

    Show me the place:
    I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
    For then he's full of matter.

First Lord

    I'll bring you to him straight.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the palace.

    Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords

DUKE FREDERICK

    Can it be possible that no man saw them?
    It cannot be: some villains of my court
    Are of consent and sufferance in this.

First Lord

    I cannot hear of any that did see her.
    The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
    Saw her abed, and in the morning early
    They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.

Second Lord

    My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
    Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
    Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,
    Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
    Your daughter and her cousin much commend
    The parts and graces of the wrestler
    That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
    And she believes, wherever they are gone,
    That youth is surely in their company.

DUKE FREDERICK

    Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
    If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
    I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,
    And let not search and inquisition quail
    To bring again these foolish runaways.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Before OLIVER'S house.

    Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting

ORLANDO

    Who's there?

ADAM

    What, my young master? O, my gentle master!
    O my sweet master! O you memory
    Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
    Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
    And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
    Why would you be so fond to overcome
    The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
    Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
    Know you not, master, to some kind of men
    Their graces serve them but as enemies?
    No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
    Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
    O, what a world is this, when what is comely
    Envenoms him that bears it!

ORLANDO

    Why, what's the matter?

ADAM

    O unhappy youth!
    Come not within these doors; within this roof
    The enemy of all your graces lives:
    Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--
    Yet not the son, I will not call him son
    Of him I was about to call his father--
    Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
    To burn the lodging where you use to lie
    And you within it: if he fail of that,
    He will have other means to cut you off.
    I overheard him and his practises.
    This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
    Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.

ORLANDO

    Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?

ADAM

    No matter whither, so you come not here.

ORLANDO

    What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
    Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
    A thievish living on the common road?
    This I must do, or know not what to do:
    Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
    I rather will subject me to the malice
    Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.

ADAM

    But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
    The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
    Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
    When service should in my old limbs lie lame
    And unregarded age in corners thrown:
    Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
    Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
    Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
    And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
    Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
    For in my youth I never did apply
    Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
    Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
    The means of weakness and debility;
    Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
    Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
    I'll do the service of a younger man
    In all your business and necessities.

ORLANDO

    O good old man, how well in thee appears
    The constant service of the antique world,
    When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
    Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
    Where none will sweat but for promotion,
    And having that, do choke their service up
    Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
    But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
    That cannot so much as a blossom yield
    In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
    But come thy ways; well go along together,
    And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
    We'll light upon some settled low content.

ADAM

    Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
    To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
    From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
    Here lived I, but now live here no more.
    At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
    But at fourscore it is too late a week:
    Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
    Than to die well and not my master's debtor.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The Forest of Arden.

    Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede, CELIA for Aliena, and TOUCHSTONE

ROSALIND

    O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!

TOUCHSTONE

    I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.

ROSALIND

    I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
    apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort
    the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show
    itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,
    good Aliena!

CELIA

    I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.

TOUCHSTONE

    For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear
    you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,
    for I think you have no money in your purse.

ROSALIND

    Well, this is the forest of Arden.

TOUCHSTONE

    Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was
    at home, I was in a better place: but travellers
    must be content.

ROSALIND

    Ay, be so, good Touchstone.

    Enter CORIN and SILVIUS
    Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in
    solemn talk.

CORIN

    That is the way to make her scorn you still.

SILVIUS

    O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!

CORIN

    I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.

SILVIUS

    No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
    Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
    As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:
    But if thy love were ever like to mine--
    As sure I think did never man love so--
    How many actions most ridiculous
    Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?

CORIN

    Into a thousand that I have forgotten.

SILVIUS

    O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!
    If thou remember'st not the slightest folly
    That ever love did make thee run into,
    Thou hast not loved:
    Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
    Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
    Thou hast not loved:
    Or if thou hast not broke from company
    Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
    Thou hast not loved.
    O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!

    Exit

ROSALIND

    Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
    I have by hard adventure found mine own.

TOUCHSTONE

    And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke
    my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
    coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the
    kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
    pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the
    wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took
    two cods and, giving her them again, said with
    weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are
    true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is
    mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.

ROSALIND

    Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.

TOUCHSTONE

    Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I
    break my shins against it.

ROSALIND

    Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
    Is much upon my fashion.

TOUCHSTONE

    And mine; but it grows something stale with me.

CELIA

    I pray you, one of you question yond man
    If he for gold will give us any food:
    I faint almost to death.

TOUCHSTONE

    Holla, you clown!

ROSALIND

    Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.

CORIN

    Who calls?

TOUCHSTONE

    Your betters, sir.

CORIN

    Else are they very wretched.

ROSALIND

    Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.

CORIN

    And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.

ROSALIND

    I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
    Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
    Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
    Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
    And faints for succor.

CORIN

    Fair sir, I pity her
    And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
    My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
    But I am shepherd to another man
    And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
    My master is of churlish disposition
    And little recks to find the way to heaven
    By doing deeds of hospitality:
    Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed
    Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
    By reason of his absence, there is nothing
    That you will feed on; but what is, come see.
    And in my voice most welcome shall you be.

ROSALIND

    What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

CORIN

    That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
    That little cares for buying any thing.

ROSALIND

    I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
    Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,
    And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.

CELIA

    And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.
    And willingly could waste my time in it.

CORIN

    Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
    Go with me: if you like upon report
    The soil, the profit and this kind of life,
    I will your very faithful feeder be
    And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. The Forest.

    Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and others

    SONG.

AMIENS

    Under the greenwood tree
    Who loves to lie with me,
    And turn his merry note
    Unto the sweet bird's throat,
    Come hither, come hither, come hither:
    Here shall he see No enemy
    But winter and rough weather.

JAQUES

    More, more, I prithee, more.

AMIENS

    It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.

JAQUES

    I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
    melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
    More, I prithee, more.

AMIENS

    My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.

JAQUES

    I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to
    sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?

AMIENS

    What you will, Monsieur Jaques.

JAQUES

    Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me
    nothing. Will you sing?

AMIENS

    More at your request than to please myself.

JAQUES

    Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;
    but that they call compliment is like the encounter
    of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
    methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
    the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will
    not, hold your tongues.

AMIENS

    Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the
    duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
    this day to look you.

JAQUES

    And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
    too disputable for my company: I think of as many
    matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no
    boast of them. Come, warble, come.
    SONG.
    Who doth ambition shun

    All together here
    And loves to live i' the sun,
    Seeking the food he eats
    And pleased with what he gets,
    Come hither, come hither, come hither:
    Here shall he see No enemy
    But winter and rough weather.

JAQUES

    I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
    yesterday in despite of my invention.

AMIENS

    And I'll sing it.

JAQUES

    Thus it goes:--
    If it do come to pass
    That any man turn ass,
    Leaving his wealth and ease,
    A stubborn will to please,
    Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:
    Here shall he see
    Gross fools as he,
    An if he will come to me.

AMIENS

    What's that 'ducdame'?

JAQUES

    'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
    circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll
    rail against all the first-born of Egypt.

AMIENS

    And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.

    Exeunt severally

SCENE VI. The forest.

    Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

ADAM

    Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!
    Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,
    kind master.

ORLANDO

    Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live
    a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.
    If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I
    will either be food for it or bring it for food to
    thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
    For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at
    the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;
    and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
    give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
    come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
    thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.
    Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear
    thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for
    lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this
    desert. Cheerly, good Adam!

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. The forest.

    A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and Lords like outlaws

DUKE SENIOR

    I think he be transform'd into a beast;
    For I can no where find him like a man.

First Lord

    My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
    Here was he merry, hearing of a song.

DUKE SENIOR

    If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
    We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
    Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.

    Enter JAQUES

First Lord

    He saves my labour by his own approach.

DUKE SENIOR

    Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
    That your poor friends must woo your company?
    What, you look merrily!

JAQUES

    A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
    A motley fool; a miserable world!
    As I do live by food, I met a fool
    Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
    And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
    In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
    'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
    'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
    And then he drew a dial from his poke,
    And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
    Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
    Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
    'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
    And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
    And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
    And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
    And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
    The motley fool thus moral on the time,
    My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
    That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
    And I did laugh sans intermission
    An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
    A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.

DUKE SENIOR

    What fool is this?

JAQUES

    O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
    And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
    They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
    Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
    After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
    With observation, the which he vents
    In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
    I am ambitious for a motley coat.

DUKE SENIOR

    Thou shalt have one.

JAQUES

    It is my only suit;
    Provided that you weed your better judgments
    Of all opinion that grows rank in them
    That I am wise. I must have liberty
    Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
    To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
    And they that are most galled with my folly,
    They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
    The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
    He that a fool doth very wisely hit
    Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
    Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
    The wise man's folly is anatomized
    Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
    Invest me in my motley; give me leave
    To speak my mind, and I will through and through
    Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
    If they will patiently receive my medicine.

DUKE SENIOR

    Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.

JAQUES

    What, for a counter, would I do but good?

DUKE SENIOR

    Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
    For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
    As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
    And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
    That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
    Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.

JAQUES

    Why, who cries out on pride,
    That can therein tax any private party?
    Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
    Till that the weary very means do ebb?
    What woman in the city do I name,
    When that I say the city-woman bears
    The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
    Who can come in and say that I mean her,
    When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
    Or what is he of basest function
    That says his bravery is not of my cost,
    Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
    His folly to the mettle of my speech?
    There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
    My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
    Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
    Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
    Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?

    Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn

ORLANDO

    Forbear, and eat no more.

JAQUES

    Why, I have eat none yet.

ORLANDO

    Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.

JAQUES

    Of what kind should this cock come of?

DUKE SENIOR

    Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
    Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
    That in civility thou seem'st so empty?

ORLANDO

    You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
    Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
    Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
    And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
    He dies that touches any of this fruit
    Till I and my affairs are answered.

JAQUES

    An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.

DUKE SENIOR

    What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
    More than your force move us to gentleness.

ORLANDO

    I almost die for food; and let me have it.

DUKE SENIOR

    Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.

ORLANDO

    Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
    I thought that all things had been savage here;
    And therefore put I on the countenance
    Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
    That in this desert inaccessible,
    Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
    Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
    If ever you have look'd on better days,
    If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
    If ever sat at any good man's feast,
    If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
    And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
    Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
    In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.

DUKE SENIOR

    True is it that we have seen better days,
    And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
    And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
    Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
    And therefore sit you down in gentleness
    And take upon command what help we have
    That to your wanting may be minister'd.

ORLANDO

    Then but forbear your food a little while,
    Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
    And give it food. There is an old poor man,
    Who after me hath many a weary step
    Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
    Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
    I will not touch a bit.

DUKE SENIOR

    Go find him out,
    And we will nothing waste till you return.

ORLANDO

    I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!

    Exit

DUKE SENIOR

    Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
    This wide and universal theatre
    Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
    Wherein we play in.

JAQUES

    All the world's a stage,
    And all the men and women merely players:
    They have their exits and their entrances;
    And one man in his time plays many parts,
    His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
    Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
    And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
    And shining morning face, creeping like snail
    Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
    Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
    Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
    Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
    Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
    Seeking the bubble reputation
    Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
    In fair round belly with good capon lined,
    With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
    Full of wise saws and modern instances;
    And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
    Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
    With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
    His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
    For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
    Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
    And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
    That ends this strange eventful history,
    Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
    Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.

    Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM

DUKE SENIOR

    Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,
    And let him feed.

ORLANDO

    I thank you most for him.

ADAM

    So had you need:
    I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.

DUKE SENIOR

    Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
    As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
    Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
    SONG.

AMIENS

    Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
    Thou art not so unkind
    As man's ingratitude;
    Thy tooth is not so keen,
    Because thou art not seen,
    Although thy breath be rude.
    Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
    Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
    Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
    This life is most jolly.
    Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
    That dost not bite so nigh
    As benefits forgot:
    Though thou the waters warp,
    Thy sting is not so sharp
    As friend remember'd not.
    Heigh-ho! sing, & c.

DUKE SENIOR

    If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
    As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
    And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
    Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
    Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
    That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
    Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
    Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
    Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
    And let me all your fortunes understand.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the palace.

    Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER

DUKE FREDERICK

    Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
    But were I not the better part made mercy,
    I should not seek an absent argument
    Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
    Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;
    Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
    Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
    To seek a living in our territory.
    Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
    Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
    Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
    Of what we think against thee.

OLIVER

    O that your highness knew my heart in this!
    I never loved my brother in my life.

DUKE FREDERICK

    More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
    And let my officers of such a nature
    Make an extent upon his house and lands:
    Do this expediently and turn him going.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The forest.

    Enter ORLANDO, with a paper

ORLANDO

    Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:
    And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey
    With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
    Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
    O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
    And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;
    That every eye which in this forest looks
    Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
    Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree
    The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.

    Exit

    Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

CORIN

    And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?

TOUCHSTONE

    Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
    life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,
    it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
    like it very well; but in respect that it is
    private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
    is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
    respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
    is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
    but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
    against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?

CORIN

    No more but that I know the more one sickens the
    worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
    means and content is without three good friends;
    that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
    burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
    great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
    he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
    complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.

TOUCHSTONE

    Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
    court, shepherd?

CORIN

    No, truly.

TOUCHSTONE

    Then thou art damned.

CORIN

    Nay, I hope.

TOUCHSTONE

    Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all
    on one side.

CORIN

    For not being at court? Your reason.

TOUCHSTONE

    Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest
    good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
    then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
    sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
    state, shepherd.

CORIN

    Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
    at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
    behavior of the country is most mockable at the
    court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
    you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
    uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.

TOUCHSTONE

    Instance, briefly; come, instance.

CORIN

    Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
    fells, you know, are greasy.

TOUCHSTONE

    Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not
    the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
    a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.

CORIN

    Besides, our hands are hard.

TOUCHSTONE

    Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
    A more sounder instance, come.

CORIN

    And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
    our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
    courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.

TOUCHSTONE

    Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a
    good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
    perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
    very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.

CORIN

    You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.

TOUCHSTONE

    Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!
    God make incision in thee! thou art raw.

CORIN

    Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
    that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
    happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
    harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
    graze and my lambs suck.

TOUCHSTONE

    That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
    and the rams together and to offer to get your
    living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
    bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
    twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
    out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
    damned for this, the devil himself will have no
    shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
    'scape.

CORIN

    Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.

    Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading

ROSALIND

    From the east to western Ind,
    No jewel is like Rosalind.
    Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
    Through all the world bears Rosalind.
    All the pictures fairest lined
    Are but black to Rosalind.
    Let no fair be kept in mind
    But the fair of Rosalind.

TOUCHSTONE

    I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and
    suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the
    right butter-women's rank to market.

ROSALIND

    Out, fool!

TOUCHSTONE

    For a taste:
    If a hart do lack a hind,
    Let him seek out Rosalind.
    If the cat will after kind,
    So be sure will Rosalind.
    Winter garments must be lined,
    So must slender Rosalind.
    They that reap must sheaf and bind;
    Then to cart with Rosalind.
    Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
    Such a nut is Rosalind.
    He that sweetest rose will find
    Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
    This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
    infect yourself with them?

ROSALIND

    Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.

TOUCHSTONE

    Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.

ROSALIND

    I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
    with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
    i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half
    ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.

TOUCHSTONE

    You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the
    forest judge.

    Enter CELIA, with a writing

ROSALIND

    Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.

CELIA

    [Reads]
    Why should this a desert be?
    For it is unpeopled? No:
    Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
    That shall civil sayings show:
    Some, how brief the life of man
    Runs his erring pilgrimage,
    That the stretching of a span
    Buckles in his sum of age;
    Some, of violated vows
    'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
    But upon the fairest boughs,
    Or at every sentence end,
    Will I Rosalinda write,
    Teaching all that read to know
    The quintessence of every sprite
    Heaven would in little show.
    Therefore Heaven Nature charged
    That one body should be fill'd
    With all graces wide-enlarged:
    Nature presently distill'd
    Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
    Cleopatra's majesty,
    Atalanta's better part,
    Sad Lucretia's modesty.
    Thus Rosalind of many parts
    By heavenly synod was devised,
    Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
    To have the touches dearest prized.
    Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
    And I to live and die her slave.

ROSALIND

    O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love
    have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never
    cried 'Have patience, good people!'

CELIA

    How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.
    Go with him, sirrah.

TOUCHSTONE

    Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
    though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.

    Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

CELIA

    Didst thou hear these verses?

ROSALIND

    O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of
    them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.

CELIA

    That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.

ROSALIND

    Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear
    themselves without the verse and therefore stood
    lamely in the verse.

CELIA

    But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
    should be hanged and carved upon these trees?

ROSALIND

    I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
    before you came; for look here what I found on a
    palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since
    Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I
    can hardly remember.

CELIA

    Trow you who hath done this?

ROSALIND

    Is it a man?

CELIA

    And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
    Change you colour?

ROSALIND

    I prithee, who?

CELIA

    O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to
    meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
    and so encounter.

ROSALIND

    Nay, but who is it?

CELIA

    Is it possible?

ROSALIND

    Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,
    tell me who it is.

CELIA

    O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
    wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,
    out of all hooping!

ROSALIND

    Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
    caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in
    my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
    South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it
    quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
    stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
    out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-
    mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at
    all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that
    may drink thy tidings.

CELIA

    So you may put a man in your belly.

ROSALIND

    Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his
    head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?

CELIA

    Nay, he hath but a little beard.

ROSALIND

    Why, God will send more, if the man will be
    thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if
    thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.

CELIA

    It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's
    heels and your heart both in an instant.

ROSALIND

    Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and
    true maid.

CELIA

    I' faith, coz, 'tis he.

ROSALIND

    Orlando?

CELIA

    Orlando.

ROSALIND

    Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and
    hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
    he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
    him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
    How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
    him again? Answer me in one word.

CELIA

    You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
    word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
    say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
    answer in a catechism.

ROSALIND

    But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
    man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
    day he wrestled?

CELIA

    It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
    propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my
    finding him, and relish it with good observance.
    I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.

ROSALIND

    It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops
    forth such fruit.

CELIA

    Give me audience, good madam.

ROSALIND

    Proceed.

CELIA

    There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.

ROSALIND

    Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
    becomes the ground.

CELIA

    Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
    unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.

ROSALIND

    O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.

CELIA

    I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
    me out of tune.

ROSALIND

    Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must
    speak. Sweet, say on.

CELIA

    You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?

    Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES

ROSALIND

    'Tis he: slink by, and note him.

JAQUES

    I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had
    as lief have been myself alone.

ORLANDO

    And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you
    too for your society.

JAQUES

    God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.

ORLANDO

    I do desire we may be better strangers.

JAQUES

    I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
    love-songs in their barks.

ORLANDO

    I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading
    them ill-favouredly.

JAQUES

    Rosalind is your love's name?

ORLANDO

    Yes, just.

JAQUES

    I do not like her name.

ORLANDO

    There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
    christened.

JAQUES

    What stature is she of?

ORLANDO

    Just as high as my heart.

JAQUES

    You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
    acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them
    out of rings?

ORLANDO

    Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from
    whence you have studied your questions.

JAQUES

    You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
    Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
    we two will rail against our mistress the world and
    all our misery.

ORLANDO

    I will chide no breather in the world but myself,
    against whom I know most faults.

JAQUES

    The worst fault you have is to be in love.

ORLANDO

    'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
    I am weary of you.

JAQUES

    By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found
    you.

ORLANDO

    He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you
    shall see him.

JAQUES

    There I shall see mine own figure.

ORLANDO

    Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.

JAQUES

    I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good
    Signior Love.

ORLANDO

    I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur
    Melancholy.

    Exit JAQUES

ROSALIND

    [Aside to CELIA] I will speak to him, like a saucy
    lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
    Do you hear, forester?

ORLANDO

    Very well: what would you?

ROSALIND

    I pray you, what is't o'clock?

ORLANDO

    You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
    in the forest.

ROSALIND

    Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
    sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
    detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.

ORLANDO

    And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
    been as proper?

ROSALIND

    By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
    divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
    withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
    withal and who he stands still withal.

ORLANDO

    I prithee, who doth he trot withal?

ROSALIND

    Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
    contract of her marriage and the day it is
    solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
    Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
    seven year.

ORLANDO

    Who ambles Time withal?

ROSALIND

    With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
    hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
    he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
    he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
    and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
    of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.

ORLANDO

    Who doth he gallop withal?

ROSALIND

    With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
    softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.

ORLANDO

    Who stays it still withal?

ROSALIND

    With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
    term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.

ORLANDO

    Where dwell you, pretty youth?

ROSALIND

    With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
    skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.

ORLANDO

    Are you native of this place?

ROSALIND

    As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.

ORLANDO

    Your accent is something finer than you could
    purchase in so removed a dwelling.

ROSALIND

    I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
    religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
    in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
    too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
    him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
    I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
    giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
    whole sex withal.

ORLANDO

    Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
    laid to the charge of women?

ROSALIND

    There were none principal; they were all like one
    another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
    monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.

ORLANDO

    I prithee, recount some of them.

ROSALIND

    No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
    are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
    abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
    their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
    on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
    Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
    give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
    quotidian of love upon him.

ORLANDO

    I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
    your remedy.

ROSALIND

    There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
    taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
    of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.

ORLANDO

    What were his marks?

ROSALIND

    A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
    sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
    spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
    which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
    simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
    revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
    bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
    untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
    careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
    are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
    loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.

ORLANDO

    Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.

ROSALIND

    Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
    love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
    do than to confess she does: that is one of the
    points in the which women still give the lie to
    their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
    that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
    is so admired?

ORLANDO

    I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
    Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.

ROSALIND

    But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?

ORLANDO

    Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.

ROSALIND

    Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
    as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
    the reason why they are not so punished and cured
    is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
    are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.

ORLANDO

    Did you ever cure any so?

ROSALIND

    Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
    his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
    woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
    youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
    and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
    inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
    passion something and for no passion truly any
    thing, as boys and women are for the most part
    cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
    him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
    for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
    from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
    madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
    the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
    And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
    me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
    heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.

ORLANDO

    I would not be cured, youth.

ROSALIND

    I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
    and come every day to my cote and woo me.

ORLANDO

    Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
    where it is.

ROSALIND

    Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
    you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
    Will you go?

ORLANDO

    With all my heart, good youth.

ROSALIND

    Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The forest.

    Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind

TOUCHSTONE

    Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your
    goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?
    doth my simple feature content you?

AUDREY

    Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!

TOUCHSTONE

    I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
    capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.

JAQUES

    [Aside] O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove
    in a thatched house!

TOUCHSTONE

    When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a
    man's good wit seconded with the forward child
    Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
    great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
    the gods had made thee poetical.

AUDREY

    I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
    deed and word? is it a true thing?

TOUCHSTONE

    No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
    feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
    they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.

AUDREY

    Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?

TOUCHSTONE

    I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
    honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
    hope thou didst feign.

AUDREY

    Would you not have me honest?

TOUCHSTONE

    No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for
    honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.

JAQUES

    [Aside] A material fool!

AUDREY

    Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
    make me honest.

TOUCHSTONE

    Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
    were to put good meat into an unclean dish.

AUDREY

    I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.

TOUCHSTONE

    Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
    sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
    be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
    with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
    village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
    of the forest and to couple us.

JAQUES

    [Aside] I would fain see this meeting.

AUDREY

    Well, the gods give us joy!

TOUCHSTONE

    Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
    stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
    but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
    though? C ourage! As horns are odious, they are
    necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
    his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and
    knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
    his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
    Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
    hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
    therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
    worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
    married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
    bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
    skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
    want. Here comes Sir Oliver.

    Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT
    Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you
    dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
    with you to your chapel?

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

    Is there none here to give the woman?

TOUCHSTONE

    I will not take her on gift of any man.

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

    Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.

JAQUES

    [Advancing]
    Proceed, proceed I'll give her.

TOUCHSTONE

    Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,
    sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
    last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
    toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.

JAQUES

    Will you be married, motley?

TOUCHSTONE

    As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and
    the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
    as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.

JAQUES

    And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
    married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
    church, and have a good priest that can tell you
    what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
    together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
    prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.

TOUCHSTONE

    [Aside] I am not in the mind but I were better to be
    married of him than of another: for he is not like
    to marry me well; and not being well married, it
    will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.

JAQUES

    Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.

TOUCHSTONE

    'Come, sweet Audrey:
    We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
    Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--
    O sweet Oliver,
    O brave Oliver,
    Leave me not behind thee: but,--
    Wind away,
    Begone, I say,
    I will not to wedding with thee.

    Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

    'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them
    all shall flout me out of my calling.

    Exit

SCENE IV. The forest.

    Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

ROSALIND

    Never talk to me; I will weep.

CELIA

    Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider
    that tears do not become a man.

ROSALIND

    But have I not cause to weep?

CELIA

    As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.

ROSALIND

    His very hair is of the dissembling colour.

CELIA

    Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
    Judas's own children.

ROSALIND

    I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.

CELIA

    An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.

ROSALIND

    And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
    of holy bread.

CELIA

    He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
    of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
    the very ice of chastity is in them.

ROSALIND

    But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
    comes not?

CELIA

    Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

ROSALIND

    Do you think so?

CELIA

    Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
    horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
    think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
    worm-eaten nut.

ROSALIND

    Not true in love?

CELIA

    Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.

ROSALIND

    You have heard him swear downright he was.

CELIA

    'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
    no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
    both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
    here in the forest on the duke your father.

ROSALIND

    I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
    him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
    him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
    But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
    man as Orlando?

CELIA

    O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
    speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
    them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
    his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
    but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
    goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
    guides. Who comes here?

    Enter CORIN

CORIN

    Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
    After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
    Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
    Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
    That was his mistress.

CELIA

    Well, and what of him?

CORIN

    If you will see a pageant truly play'd,
    Between the pale complexion of true love
    And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
    Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
    If you will mark it.

ROSALIND

    O, come, let us remove:
    The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
    Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
    I'll prove a busy actor in their play.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the forest.

    Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE

SILVIUS

    Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;
    Say that you love me not, but say not so
    In bitterness. The common executioner,
    Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
    Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
    But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
    Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?

    Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind

PHEBE

    I would not be thy executioner:
    I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
    Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
    'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
    That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
    Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
    Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
    Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
    And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
    Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
    Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
    Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
    Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
    Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
    Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
    The cicatrice and capable impressure
    Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
    Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
    Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
    That can do hurt.

SILVIUS

    O dear Phebe,
    If ever,--as that ever may be near,--
    You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
    Then shall you know the wounds invisible
    That love's keen arrows make.

PHEBE

    But till that time
    Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
    Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
    As till that time I shall not pity thee.

ROSALIND

    And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
    That you insult, exult, and all at once,
    Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
    As, by my faith, I see no more in you
    Than without candle may go dark to bed--
    Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
    Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
    I see no more in you than in the ordinary
    Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
    I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
    No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
    'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
    Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
    That can entame my spirits to your worship.
    You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
    Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
    You are a thousand times a properer man
    Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
    That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:
    'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
    And out of you she sees herself more proper
    Than any of her lineaments can show her.
    But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
    And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
    For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
    Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
    Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
    Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
    So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.

PHEBE

    Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
    I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.

ROSALIND

    He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
    fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
    she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her
    with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?

PHEBE

    For no ill will I bear you.

ROSALIND

    I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
    For I am falser than vows made in wine:
    Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
    'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
    Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
    Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
    And be not proud: though all the world could see,
    None could be so abused in sight as he.
    Come, to our flock.

    Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN

PHEBE

    Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
    'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'

SILVIUS

    Sweet Phebe,--

PHEBE

    Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?

SILVIUS

    Sweet Phebe, pity me.

PHEBE

    Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.

SILVIUS

    Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:
    If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
    By giving love your sorrow and my grief
    Were both extermined.

PHEBE

    Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?

SILVIUS

    I would have you.

PHEBE

    Why, that were covetousness.
    Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
    And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
    But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
    Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
    I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:
    But do not look for further recompense
    Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.

SILVIUS

    So holy and so perfect is my love,
    And I in such a poverty of grace,
    That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
    To glean the broken ears after the man
    That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
    A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.

PHEBE

    Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?

SILVIUS

    Not very well, but I have met him oft;
    And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
    That the old carlot once was master of.

PHEBE

    Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
    'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
    But what care I for words? yet words do well
    When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
    It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
    But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
    He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
    Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
    Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
    He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
    His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
    There was a pretty redness in his lip,
    A little riper and more lusty red
    Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
    Between the constant red and mingled damask.
    There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
    In parcels as I did, would have gone near
    To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
    I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
    I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
    For what had he to do to chide at me?
    He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
    And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:
    I marvel why I answer'd not again:
    But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
    I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
    And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?

SILVIUS

    Phebe, with all my heart.

PHEBE

    I'll write it straight;
    The matter's in my head and in my heart:
    I will be bitter with him and passing short.
    Go with me, Silvius.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. The forest.

    Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES

JAQUES

    I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted
    with thee.

ROSALIND

    They say you are a melancholy fellow.

JAQUES

    I am so; I do love it better than laughing.

ROSALIND

    Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
    fellows and betray themselves to every modern
    censure worse than drunkards.

JAQUES

    Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.

ROSALIND

    Why then, 'tis good to be a post.

JAQUES

    I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
    emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,
    nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the
    soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,
    which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor
    the lover's, which is all these: but it is a
    melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
    extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's
    contemplation of my travels, in which my often
    rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.

ROSALIND

    A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to
    be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
    other men's; then, to have seen much and to have
    nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.

JAQUES

    Yes, I have gained my experience.

ROSALIND

    And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
    a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
    sad; and to travel for it too!

    Enter ORLANDO

ORLANDO

    Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!

JAQUES

    Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.

    Exit

ROSALIND

    Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and
    wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
    own country, be out of love with your nativity and
    almost chide God for making you that countenance you
    are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
    gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
    all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
    another trick, never come in my sight more.

ORLANDO

    My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.

ROSALIND

    Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
    divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
    a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
    affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
    hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant
    him heart-whole.

ORLANDO

    Pardon me, dear Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I
    had as lief be wooed of a snail.

ORLANDO

    Of a snail?

ROSALIND

    Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he
    carries his house on his head; a better jointure,
    I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
    his destiny with him.

ORLANDO

    What's that?

ROSALIND

    Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
    beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
    his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.

ORLANDO

    Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.

ROSALIND

    And I am your Rosalind.

CELIA

    It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
    Rosalind of a better leer than you.

ROSALIND

    Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday
    humour and like enough to consent. What would you
    say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?

ORLANDO

    I would kiss before I spoke.

ROSALIND

    Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
    gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
    occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
    out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God
    warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.

ORLANDO

    How if the kiss be denied?

ROSALIND

    Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.

ORLANDO

    Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?

ROSALIND

    Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or
    I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.

ORLANDO

    What, of my suit?

ROSALIND

    Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
    Am not I your Rosalind?

ORLANDO

    I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
    talking of her.

ROSALIND

    Well in her person I say I will not have you.

ORLANDO

    Then in mine own person I die.

ROSALIND

    No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
    almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
    there was not any man died in his own person,
    videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
    dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
    could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
    of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
    year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
    for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went
    but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
    taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
    coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
    But these are all lies: men have died from time to
    time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.

ORLANDO

    I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,
    for, I protest, her frown might kill me.

ROSALIND

    By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now
    I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
    disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
    it.

ORLANDO

    Then love me, Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.

ORLANDO

    And wilt thou have me?

ROSALIND

    Ay, and twenty such.

ORLANDO

    What sayest thou?

ROSALIND

    Are you not good?

ORLANDO

    I hope so.

ROSALIND

    Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
    Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
    Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?

ORLANDO

    Pray thee, marry us.

CELIA

    I cannot say the words.

ROSALIND

    You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'

CELIA

    Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?

ORLANDO

    I will.

ROSALIND

    Ay, but when?

ORLANDO

    Why now; as fast as she can marry us.

ROSALIND

    Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'

ORLANDO

    I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.

ROSALIND

    I might ask you for your commission; but I do take
    thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
    before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
    runs before her actions.

ORLANDO

    So do all thoughts; they are winged.

ROSALIND

    Now tell me how long you would have her after you
    have possessed her.

ORLANDO

    For ever and a day.

ROSALIND

    Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;
    men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
    maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
    changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
    of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
    more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
    new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
    than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
    in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
    disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and
    that when thou art inclined to sleep.

ORLANDO

    But will my Rosalind do so?

ROSALIND

    By my life, she will do as I do.

ORLANDO

    O, but she is wise.

ROSALIND

    Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
    wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
    wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
    'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly
    with the smoke out at the chimney.

ORLANDO

    A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
    'Wit, whither wilt?'

ROSALIND

    Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
    your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.

ORLANDO

    And what wit could wit have to excuse that?

ROSALIND

    Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
    never take her without her answer, unless you take
    her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
    make her fault her husband's occasion, let her
    never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
    it like a fool!

ORLANDO

    For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.

ROSALIND

    Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.

ORLANDO

    I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
    will be with thee again.

ROSALIND

    Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you
    would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
    thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
    won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,
    death! Two o'clock is your hour?

ORLANDO

    Ay, sweet Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
    me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
    if you break one jot of your promise or come one
    minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
    pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
    and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
    may be chosen out of the gross band of the
    unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
    your promise.

ORLANDO

    With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
    Rosalind: so adieu.

ROSALIND

    Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
    offenders, and let Time try: adieu.

    Exit ORLANDO

CELIA

    You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
    we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
    head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
    her own nest.

ROSALIND

    O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
    didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
    it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
    bottom, like the bay of Portugal.

CELIA

    Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
    affection in, it runs out.

ROSALIND

    No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
    of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
    that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
    because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
    am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
    of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
    sigh till he come.

CELIA

    And I'll sleep.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The forest.

    Enter JAQUES, Lords, and Foresters

JAQUES

    Which is he that killed the deer?

A Lord

    Sir, it was I.

JAQUES

    Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman
    conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's
    horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
    you no song, forester, for this purpose?

Forester

    Yes, sir.

JAQUES

    Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
    make noise enough.
    SONG.

Forester

    What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
    His leather skin and horns to wear.
    Then sing him home;

    The rest shall bear this burden
    Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
    It was a crest ere thou wast born:
    Thy father's father wore it,
    And thy father bore it:
    The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
    Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The forest.

    Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

ROSALIND

    How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and
    here much Orlando!

CELIA

    I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he
    hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
    sleep. Look, who comes here.

    Enter SILVIUS

SILVIUS

    My errand is to you, fair youth;
    My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
    I know not the contents; but, as I guess
    By the stern brow and waspish action
    Which she did use as she was writing of it,
    It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
    I am but as a guiltless messenger.

ROSALIND

    Patience herself would startle at this letter
    And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
    She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
    She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
    Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
    Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
    Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
    This is a letter of your own device.

SILVIUS

    No, I protest, I know not the contents:
    Phebe did write it.

ROSALIND

    Come, come, you are a fool
    And turn'd into the extremity of love.
    I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
    A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
    That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
    She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
    I say she never did invent this letter;
    This is a man's invention and his hand.

SILVIUS

    Sure, it is hers.

ROSALIND

    Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
    A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
    Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
    Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
    Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
    Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?

SILVIUS

    So please you, for I never heard it yet;
    Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.

ROSALIND

    She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.

    Reads
    Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
    That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
    Can a woman rail thus?

SILVIUS

    Call you this railing?

ROSALIND

    [Reads]
    Why, thy godhead laid apart,
    Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
    Did you ever hear such railing?
    Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
    That could do no vengeance to me.
    Meaning me a beast.
    If the scorn of your bright eyne
    Have power to raise such love in mine,
    Alack, in me what strange effect
    Would they work in mild aspect!
    Whiles you chid me, I did love;
    How then might your prayers move!
    He that brings this love to thee
    Little knows this love in me:
    And by him seal up thy mind;
    Whether that thy youth and kind
    Will the faithful offer take
    Of me and all that I can make;
    Or else by him my love deny,
    And then I'll study how to die.

SILVIUS

    Call you this chiding?

CELIA

    Alas, poor shepherd!

ROSALIND

    Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt
    thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an
    instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
    be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see
    love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
    her: that if she love me, I charge her to love
    thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless
    thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,
    hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.

    Exit SILVIUS

    Enter OLIVER

OLIVER

    Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,
    Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
    A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?

CELIA

    West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:
    The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
    Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
    But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
    There's none within.

OLIVER

    If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
    Then should I know you by description;
    Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,
    Of female favour, and bestows himself
    Like a ripe sister: the woman low
    And browner than her brother.' Are not you
    The owner of the house I did inquire for?

CELIA

    It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

OLIVER

    Orlando doth commend him to you both,
    And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
    He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?

ROSALIND

    I am: what must we understand by this?

OLIVER

    Some of my shame; if you will know of me
    What man I am, and how, and why, and where
    This handkercher was stain'd.

CELIA

    I pray you, tell it.

OLIVER

    When last the young Orlando parted from you
    He left a promise to return again
    Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
    Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
    Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
    And mark what object did present itself:
    Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
    And high top bald with dry antiquity,
    A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
    Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
    A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
    Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
    The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
    Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
    And with indented glides did slip away
    Into a bush: under which bush's shade
    A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
    Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
    When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
    The royal disposition of that beast
    To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
    This seen, Orlando did approach the man
    And found it was his brother, his elder brother.

CELIA

    O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
    And he did render him the most unnatural
    That lived amongst men.

OLIVER

    And well he might so do,
    For well I know he was unnatural.

ROSALIND

    But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
    Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?

OLIVER

    Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
    But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
    And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
    Made him give battle to the lioness,
    Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
    From miserable slumber I awaked.

CELIA

    Are you his brother?

ROSALIND

    Wast you he rescued?

CELIA

    Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

OLIVER

    'Twas I; but 'tis not I I do not shame
    To tell you what I was, since my conversion
    So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.

ROSALIND

    But, for the bloody napkin?

OLIVER

    By and by.
    When from the first to last betwixt us two
    Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
    As how I came into that desert place:--
    In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
    Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
    Committing me unto my brother's love;
    Who led me instantly unto his cave,
    There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
    The lioness had torn some flesh away,
    Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
    And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
    Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;
    And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
    He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
    To tell this story, that you might excuse
    His broken promise, and to give this napkin
    Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
    That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.

    ROSALIND swoons

CELIA

    Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!

OLIVER

    Many will swoon when they do look on blood.

CELIA

    There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!

OLIVER

    Look, he recovers.

ROSALIND

    I would I were at home.

CELIA

    We'll lead you thither.
    I pray you, will you take him by the arm?

OLIVER

    Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a
    man's heart.

ROSALIND

    I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would
    think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell
    your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!

OLIVER

    This was not counterfeit: there is too great
    testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
    of earnest.

ROSALIND

    Counterfeit, I assure you.

OLIVER

    Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.

ROSALIND

    So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.

CELIA

    Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw
    homewards. Good sir, go with us.

OLIVER

    That will I, for I must bear answer back
    How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend
    my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?

TOUCHSTONE

    We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.

AUDREY

    Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
    gentleman's saying.

TOUCHSTONE

    A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile
    Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the
    forest lays claim to you.

AUDREY

    Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in
    the world: here comes the man you mean.

TOUCHSTONE

    It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my
    troth, we that have good wits have much to answer
    for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.

    Enter WILLIAM

WILLIAM

    Good even, Audrey.

AUDREY

    God ye good even, William.

WILLIAM

    And good even to you, sir.

TOUCHSTONE

    Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
    head; nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?

WILLIAM

    Five and twenty, sir.

TOUCHSTONE

    A ripe age. Is thy name William?

WILLIAM

    William, sir.

TOUCHSTONE

    A fair name. Wast born i' the forest here?

WILLIAM

    Ay, sir, I thank God.

TOUCHSTONE

    'Thank God;' a good answer. Art rich?

WILLIAM

    Faith, sir, so so.

TOUCHSTONE

    'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
    yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?

WILLIAM

    Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.

TOUCHSTONE

    Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,
    'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man
    knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen
    philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
    would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;
    meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
    lips to open. You do love this maid?

WILLIAM

    I do, sir.

TOUCHSTONE

    Give me your hand. Art thou learned?

WILLIAM

    No, sir.

TOUCHSTONE

    Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it
    is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out
    of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty
    the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse
    is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.

WILLIAM

    Which he, sir?

TOUCHSTONE

    He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
    clown, abandon,--which is in the vulgar leave,--the
    society,--which in the boorish is company,--of this
    female,--which in the common is woman; which
    together is, abandon the society of this female, or,
    clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better
    understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make
    thee away, translate thy life into death, thy
    liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with
    thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy
    with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with
    policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:
    therefore tremble and depart.

AUDREY

    Do, good William.

WILLIAM

    God rest you merry, sir.

SCENE II. The forest.

    Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER

ORLANDO

    Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you
    should like her? that but seeing you should love
    her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should
    grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?

OLIVER

    Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the
    poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden
    wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,
    I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;
    consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it
    shall be to your good; for my father's house and all
    the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I
    estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.

ORLANDO

    You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:
    thither will I invite the duke and all's contented
    followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look
    you, here comes my Rosalind.

    Enter ROSALIND

ROSALIND

    God save you, brother.

OLIVER

    And you, fair sister.

    Exit

ROSALIND

    O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee
    wear thy heart in a scarf!

ORLANDO

    It is my arm.

ROSALIND

    I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
    of a lion.

ORLANDO

    Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.

ROSALIND

    Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
    swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?

ORLANDO

    Ay, and greater wonders than that.

ROSALIND

    O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was
    never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
    and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and
    overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner
    met but they looked, no sooner looked but they
    loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner
    sighed but they asked one another the reason, no
    sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;
    and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
    to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or
    else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
    the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs
    cannot part them.

ORLANDO

    They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the
    duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it
    is to look into happiness through another man's
    eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
    the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall
    think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.

ROSALIND

    Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?

ORLANDO

    I can live no longer by thinking.

ROSALIND

    I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
    Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,
    that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I
    speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
    of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;
    neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
    some little measure draw a belief from you, to do
    yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if
    you please, that I can do strange things: I have,
    since I was three year old, conversed with a
    magician, most profound in his art and yet not
    damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
    as your gesture cries it out, when your brother
    marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into
    what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is
    not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient
    to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
    as she is and without any danger.

ORLANDO

    Speakest thou in sober meanings?

ROSALIND

    By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I
    say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your
    best array: bid your friends; for if you will be
    married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.

    Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE
    Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.

PHEBE

    Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,
    To show the letter that I writ to you.

ROSALIND

    I care not if I have: it is my study
    To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
    You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;
    Look upon him, love him; he worships you.

PHEBE

    Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.

SILVIUS

    It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
    And so am I for Phebe.

PHEBE

    And I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO

    And I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    And I for no woman.

SILVIUS

    It is to be all made of faith and service;
    And so am I for Phebe.

PHEBE

    And I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO

    And I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    And I for no woman.

SILVIUS

    It is to be all made of fantasy,
    All made of passion and all made of wishes,
    All adoration, duty, and observance,
    All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
    All purity, all trial, all observance;
    And so am I for Phebe.

PHEBE

    And so am I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO

    And so am I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND

    And so am I for no woman.

PHEBE

    If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

SILVIUS

    If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

ORLANDO

    If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

ROSALIND

    Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'

ORLANDO

    To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.

ROSALIND

    Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling
    of Irish wolves against the moon.

    To SILVIUS
    I will help you, if I can:

    To PHEBE
    I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.

    To PHEBE
    I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be
    married to-morrow:

    To ORLANDO
    I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you
    shall be married to-morrow:

    To SILVIUS
    I will content you, if what pleases you contents
    you, and you shall be married to-morrow.

    To ORLANDO
    As you love Rosalind, meet:

    To SILVIUS
    as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,
    I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands.

SILVIUS

    I'll not fail, if I live.

PHEBE

    Nor I.

ORLANDO

    Nor I.

TOUCHSTONE

    To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will
    we be married.

AUDREY

    I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is
    no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the
    world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.

    Enter two Pages

First Page

    Well met, honest gentleman.

TOUCHSTONE

    By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.

Second Page

    We are for you: sit i' the middle.

First Page

    Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or
    spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only
    prologues to a bad voice?

Second Page

    I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two
    gipsies on a horse.
    SONG.
    It was a lover and his lass,
    With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    That o'er the green corn-field did pass
    In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
    When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:
    Sweet lovers love the spring.
    Between the acres of the rye,
    With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino
    These pretty country folks would lie,
    In spring time, & c.
    This carol they began that hour,
    With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
    How that a life was but a flower
    In spring time, & c.
    And therefore take the present time,
    With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;
    For love is crowned with the prime
    In spring time, & c.

TOUCHSTONE

    Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
    matter in the ditty, yet the note was very
    untuneable.

First Page

    You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.

TOUCHSTONE

    By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear
    such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and God mend
    your voices! Come, Audrey.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The forest.

    Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER, and CELIA

DUKE SENIOR

    Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
    Can do all this that he hath promised?

ORLANDO

    I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;
    As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.

    Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE

ROSALIND

    Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:
    You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
    You will bestow her on Orlando here?

DUKE SENIOR

    That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.

ROSALIND

    And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?

ORLANDO

    That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.

ROSALIND

    You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?

PHEBE

    That will I, should I die the hour after.

ROSALIND

    But if you do refuse to marry me,
    You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?

PHEBE

    So is the bargain.

ROSALIND

    You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?

SILVIUS

    Though to have her and death were both one thing.

ROSALIND

    I have promised to make all this matter even.
    Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;
    You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:
    Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
    Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:
    Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.
    If she refuse me: and from hence I go,
    To make these doubts all even.

    Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA

DUKE SENIOR

    I do remember in this shepherd boy
    Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.

ORLANDO

    My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
    Methought he was a brother to your daughter:
    But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
    And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
    Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
    Whom he reports to be a great magician,
    Obscured in the circle of this forest.

    Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

JAQUES

    There is, sure, another flood toward, and these
    couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
    very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.

TOUCHSTONE

    Salutation and greeting to you all!

JAQUES

    Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the
    motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
    the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.

TOUCHSTONE

    If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
    purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered
    a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth
    with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have
    had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.

JAQUES

    And how was that ta'en up?

TOUCHSTONE

    Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
    seventh cause.

JAQUES

    How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.

DUKE SENIOR

    I like him very well.

TOUCHSTONE

    God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I
    press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
    copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
    marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
    sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
    humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
    will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
    poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.

DUKE SENIOR

    By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.

TOUCHSTONE

    According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.

JAQUES

    But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the
    quarrel on the seventh cause?

TOUCHSTONE

    Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
    seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the
    cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,
    if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
    mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
    If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he
    would send me word, he cut it to please himself:
    this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
    not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is
    called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
    well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this
    is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
    well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the
    Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
    Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.

JAQUES

    And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

TOUCHSTONE

    I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
    nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we
    measured swords and parted.

JAQUES

    Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?

TOUCHSTONE

    O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have
    books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
    The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the
    Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the
    fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
    Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
    Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
    these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
    avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
    justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
    parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
    of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and
    they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
    only peacemaker; much virtue in If.

JAQUES

    Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at
    any thing and yet a fool.

DUKE SENIOR

    He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under
    the presentation of that he shoots his wit.

HYMEN

    Then is there mirth in heaven,
    When earthly things made even
    Atone together.
    Good duke, receive thy daughter
    Hymen from heaven brought her,
    Yea, brought her hither,
    That thou mightst join her hand with his
    Whose heart within his bosom is.

ROSALIND

    [To DUKE SENIOR] To you I give myself, for I am yours.

    To ORLANDO
    To you I give myself, for I am yours.

DUKE SENIOR

    If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.

ORLANDO

    If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.

PHEBE

    If sight and shape be true,
    Why then, my love adieu!

ROSALIND

    I'll have no father, if you be not he:
    I'll have no husband, if you be not he:
    Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.

HYMEN

    Peace, ho! I bar confusion:
    'Tis I must make conclusion
    Of these most strange events:
    Here's eight that must take hands
    To join in Hymen's bands,
    If truth holds true contents.
    You and you no cross shall part:
    You and you are heart in heart
    You to his love must accord,
    Or have a woman to your lord:
    You and you are sure together,
    As the winter to foul weather.
    Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
    Feed yourselves with questioning;
    That reason wonder may diminish,
    How thus we met, and these things finish.
    SONG.
    Wedding is great Juno's crown:
    O blessed bond of board and bed!
    'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
    High wedlock then be honoured:
    Honour, high honour and renown,
    To Hymen, god of every town!

DUKE SENIOR

    O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
    Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.

PHEBE

    I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
    Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.

    Enter JAQUES DE BOYS

JAQUES DE BOYS

    Let me have audience for a word or two:
    I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
    That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
    Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
    Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
    Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
    In his own conduct, purposely to take
    His brother here and put him to the sword:
    And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
    Where meeting with an old religious man,
    After some question with him, was converted
    Both from his enterprise and from the world,
    His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
    And all their lands restored to them again
    That were with him exiled. This to be true,
    I do engage my life.

DUKE SENIOR

    Welcome, young man;
    Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
    To one his lands withheld, and to the other
    A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
    First, in this forest, let us do those ends
    That here were well begun and well begot:
    And after, every of this happy number
    That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
    Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
    According to the measure of their states.
    Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
    And fall into our rustic revelry.
    Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
    With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.

JAQUES

    Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
    The duke hath put on a religious life
    And thrown into neglect the pompous court?

JAQUES DE BOYS

    He hath.

JAQUES

    To him will I : out of these convertites
    There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.

    To DUKE SENIOR
    You to your former honour I bequeath;
    Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:

    To ORLANDO
    You to a love that your true faith doth merit:

    To OLIVER
    You to your land and love and great allies:

    To SILVIUS
    You to a long and well-deserved bed:

    To TOUCHSTONE
    And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
    Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:
    I am for other than for dancing measures.

DUKE SENIOR

    Stay, Jaques, stay.

JAQUES

    To see no pastime I what you would have
    I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.

    Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
    As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.

    EPILOGUE

ROSALIND

    It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;
    but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
    the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
    no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no
    epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
    and good plays prove the better by the help of good
    epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am
    neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
    you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
    furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not
    become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin
    with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love
    you bear to men, to like as much of this play as
    please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love
    you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,
    none of you hates them--that between you and the
    women the play may please. If I were a woman I
    would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
    me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I
    defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good
    beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my
    kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.

The Comedy of Errors

ACT I
SCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.

    Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants

AEGEON

    Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
    And by the doom of death end woes and all.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
    I am not partial to infringe our laws:
    The enmity and discord which of late
    Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
    To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
    Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
    Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
    Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
    For, since the mortal and intestine jars
    'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
    It hath in solemn synods been decreed
    Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
    To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
    If any born at Ephesus be seen
    At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
    Again: if any Syracusian born
    Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
    His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
    Unless a thousand marks be levied,
    To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
    Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
    Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
    Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.

AEGEON

    Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
    My woes end likewise with the evening sun.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
    Why thou departed'st from thy native home
    And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.

AEGEON

    A heavier task could not have been imposed
    Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
    Yet, that the world may witness that my end
    Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
    I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
    In Syracusa was I born, and wed
    Unto a woman, happy but for me,
    And by me, had not our hap been bad.
    With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
    By prosperous voyages I often made
    To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
    And the great care of goods at random left
    Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
    From whom my absence was not six months old
    Before herself, almost at fainting under
    The pleasing punishment that women bear,
    Had made provision for her following me
    And soon and safe arrived where I was.
    There had she not been long, but she became
    A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
    And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
    As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
    That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
    A meaner woman was delivered
    Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
    Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
    I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
    My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
    Made daily motions for our home return:
    Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
    We came aboard.
    A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
    Before the always wind-obeying deep
    Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
    But longer did we not retain much hope;
    For what obscured light the heavens did grant
    Did but convey unto our fearful minds
    A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
    Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
    Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
    Weeping before for what she saw must come,
    And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
    That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
    Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
    And this it was, for other means was none:
    The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
    And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
    My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
    Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
    Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
    To him one of the other twins was bound,
    Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
    The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
    Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
    Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
    And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
    Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
    At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
    Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
    And by the benefit of his wished light,
    The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
    Two ships from far making amain to us,
    Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
    But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
    Gather the sequel by that went before.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
    For we may pity, though not pardon thee.

AEGEON

    O, had the gods done so, I had not now
    Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
    For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
    We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
    Which being violently borne upon,
    Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
    So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
    Fortune had left to both of us alike
    What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
    Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
    With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
    Was carried with more speed before the wind;
    And in our sight they three were taken up
    By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
    At length, another ship had seized on us;
    And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
    Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
    And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
    Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
    And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
    Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
    That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
    To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.

DUKE SOLINUS

    And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
    Do me the favour to dilate at full
    What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.

AEGEON

    My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
    At eighteen years became inquisitive
    After his brother: and importuned me
    That his attendant--so his case was like,
    Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
    Might bear him company in the quest of him:
    Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
    I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
    Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
    Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
    And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
    Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
    Or that or any place that harbours men.
    But here must end the story of my life;
    And happy were I in my timely death,
    Could all my travels warrant me they live.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
    To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
    Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
    Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
    Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
    My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
    But, though thou art adjudged to the death
    And passed sentence may not be recall'd
    But to our honour's great disparagement,
    Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
    Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
    To seek thy life by beneficial help:
    Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
    Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
    And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
    Gaoler, take him to thy custody.

Gaoler

    I will, my lord.

AEGEON

    Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
    But to procrastinate his lifeless end.

    This very day a Syracusian merchant
    Is apprehended for arrival here;

    Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
    And afterward consort you till bed-time:
    My present business calls me from you now.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
    And wander up and down to view the city.

First Merchant

    Sir, I commend you to your own content.

    Exit
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    He that commends me to mine own content
    Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
    I to the world am like a drop of water
    That in the ocean seeks another drop,
    Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
    Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
    So I, to find a mother and a brother,
    In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.

    Enter DROMIO of Ephesus
    Here comes the almanac of my true date.
    What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
    The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
    The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
    My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
    She is so hot because the meat is cold;
    The meat is cold because you come not home;
    You come not home because you have no stomach;
    You have no stomach having broke your fast;
    But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
    Are penitent for your default to-day.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
    Where have you left the money that I gave you?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
    To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
    The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I am not in a sportive humour now:
    Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
    We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
    So great a charge from thine own custody?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
    I from my mistress come to you in post;
    If I return, I shall be post indeed,
    For she will score your fault upon my pate.
    Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
    And strike you home without a messenger.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
    Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
    Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
    And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
    Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
    My mistress and her sister stays for you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
    Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
    That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
    Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
    Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
    But not a thousand marks between you both.
    If I should pay your worship those again,
    Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
    She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
    And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
    Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
    Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.

    Exit
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Upon my life, by some device or other
    The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
    They say this town is full of cozenage,
    As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
    Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
    Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
    Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
    And many such-like liberties of sin:
    If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
    I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
    I greatly fear my money is not safe.

    Exit

ACT II
SCENE I. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

    Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA

    Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
    That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
    Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.

LUCIANA

    Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
    And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
    Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
    A man is master of his liberty:
    Time is their master, and, when they see time,
    They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.

ADRIANA

    Why should their liberty than ours be more?

LUCIANA

    Because their business still lies out o' door.

ADRIANA

    Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.

LUCIANA

    O, know he is the bridle of your will.

ADRIANA

    There's none but asses will be bridled so.

LUCIANA

    Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
    There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
    But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
    The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
    Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
    Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
    Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
    Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
    Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
    Are masters to their females, and their lords:
    Then let your will attend on their accords.

ADRIANA

    This servitude makes you to keep unwed.

LUCIANA

    Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.

ADRIANA

    But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.

LUCIANA

    Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.

ADRIANA

    How if your husband start some other where?

LUCIANA

    Till he come home again, I would forbear.

ADRIANA

    Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
    They can be meek that have no other cause.
    A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
    We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
    But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
    As much or more would we ourselves complain:
    So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
    With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
    But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
    This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.

LUCIANA

    Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
    Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.

    Enter DROMIO of Ephesus

ADRIANA

    Say, is your tardy master now at hand?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
    can witness.

ADRIANA

    Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
    Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.

LUCIANA

    Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his
    blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
    understand them.

ADRIANA

    But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he
    hath great care to please his wife.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.

ADRIANA

    Horn-mad, thou villain!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I mean not cuckold-mad;
    But, sure, he is stark mad.
    When I desired him to come home to dinner,
    He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
    ''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
    'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
    'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
    'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
    'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
    'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
    I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'

LUCIANA

    Quoth who?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Quoth my master:
    'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
    So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
    I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
    For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.

ADRIANA

    Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Go back again, and be new beaten home?
    For God's sake, send some other messenger.

ADRIANA

    Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    And he will bless that cross with other beating:
    Between you I shall have a holy head.

ADRIANA

    Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Am I so round with you as you with me,
    That like a football you do spurn me thus?
    You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
    If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.

    Exit

LUCIANA

    Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!

ADRIANA

    His company must do his minions grace,
    Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
    Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
    From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
    Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
    If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
    Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
    Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
    That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
    What ruins are in me that can be found,
    By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
    Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
    A sunny look of his would soon repair
    But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
    And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.

LUCIANA

    Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!

ADRIANA

    Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
    I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
    Or else what lets it but he would be here?
    Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
    Would that alone, alone he would detain,
    So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
    I see the jewel best enamelled
    Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
    That others touch, and often touching will
    Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
    By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
    Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
    I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.

LUCIANA

    How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A public place.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse

    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
    Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
    Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
    By computation and mine host's report.
    I could not speak with Dromio since at first
    I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.

    Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
    How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
    As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
    You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
    Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
    My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
    That thus so madly thou didst answer me?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Even now, even here, not half an hour since.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I did not see you since you sent me hence,
    Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
    And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
    For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
    What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
    Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.

    Beating him

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
    Upon what bargain do you give it me?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Because that I familiarly sometimes
    Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
    Your sauciness will jest upon my love
    And make a common of my serious hours.
    When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
    But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
    If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
    And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
    Or I will beat this method in your sconce.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
    had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
    long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
    it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
    But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Dost thou not know?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Shall I tell you why?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
    a wherefore.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
    For urging it the second time to me.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
    When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
    nor reason?
    Well, sir, I thank you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thank me, sir, for what?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
    something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    In good time, sir; what's that?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Basting.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Your reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
    dry basting.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
    time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    By what rule, sir?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
    pate of father Time himself.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Let's hear it.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
    grows bald by nature.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    May he not do it by fine and recovery?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
    lost hair of another man.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
    so plentiful an excrement?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
    and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
    it in a kind of jollity.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    For what reason?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    For two; and sound ones too.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Nay, not sound, I pray you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Sure ones, then.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Certain ones then.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Name them.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    The one, to save the money that he spends in
    trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
    drop in his porridge.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    You would all this time have proved there is no
    time for all things.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
    lost by nature.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
    time to recover.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
    to the world's end will have bald followers.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
    But, soft! who wafts us yonder?

    Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA

    Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
    Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
    I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
    The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
    That never words were music to thine ear,
    That never object pleasing in thine eye,
    That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
    That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
    Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
    How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
    That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
    Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
    That, undividable, incorporate,
    Am better than thy dear self's better part.
    Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
    For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
    A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
    And take unmingled that same drop again,
    Without addition or diminishing,
    As take from me thyself and not me too.
    How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
    Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
    And that this body, consecrate to thee,
    By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
    Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
    And hurl the name of husband in my face
    And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
    And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
    And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
    I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
    I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
    My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
    For if we too be one and thou play false,
    I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
    Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
    Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
    I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
    In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
    As strange unto your town as to your talk;
    Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
    Want wit in all one word to understand.

LUCIANA

    Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
    When were you wont to use my sister thus?
    She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    By Dromio?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    By me?

ADRIANA

    By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
    That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
    Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
    What is the course and drift of your compact?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
    Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I never spake with her in all my life.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    How can she thus then call us by our names,
    Unless it be by inspiration.

ADRIANA

    How ill agrees it with your gravity
    To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
    Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
    Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
    But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
    Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
    Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
    Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
    Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
    If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
    Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
    Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
    Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
    What, was I married to her in my dream?
    Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
    What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
    Until I know this sure uncertainty,
    I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.

LUCIANA

    Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
    This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
    We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
    If we obey them not, this will ensue,
    They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.

LUCIANA

    Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
    Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I am transformed, master, am I not?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I think thou art in mind, and so am I.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thou hast thine own form.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No, I am an ape.

LUCIANA

    If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
    'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
    But I should know her as well as she knows me.

ADRIANA

    Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
    To put the finger in the eye and weep,
    Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
    Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
    Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
    And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
    Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
    Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
    Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
    Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
    Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
    I'll say as they say and persever so,
    And in this mist at all adventures go.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, shall I be porter at the gate?

ADRIANA

    Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.

LUCIANA

    Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus, ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR

    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
    My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
    Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
    To see the making of her carcanet,
    And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
    But here's a villain that would face me down
    He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
    And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
    And that I did deny my wife and house.
    Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
    That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
    If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
    Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I think thou art an ass.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Marry, so it doth appear
    By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
    I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
    You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
    May answer my good will and your good welcome here.

BALTHAZAR

    I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your
    welcome dear.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
    A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.

BALTHAZAR

    Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.

BALTHAZAR

    Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:
    But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
    Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
    But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,
    idiot, patch!
    Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
    Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st
    for such store,
    When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
    the street.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Let him walk from whence he came, lest he
    catch cold on's feet.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Who talks within there? ho, open the door!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell
    me wherefore.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Nor to-day here you must not; come again
    when you may.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] The porter for this time, sir, and my name
    is Dromio.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
    The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
    If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
    Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
    name for an ass.

LUCE

    [Within] What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those
    at the gate?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Let my master in, Luce.

LUCE

    [Within] Faith, no; he comes too late;
    And so tell your master.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    O Lord, I must laugh!
    Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?

LUCE

    [Within] Have at you with another; that's--When?
    can you tell?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast
    answered him well.

ANTIPHOLUS

    Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?
    OF EPHESUS

LUCE

    [Within] I thought to have asked you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] And you said no.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Thou baggage, let me in.

LUCE

    [Within] Can you tell for whose sake?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Master, knock the door hard.

LUCE

    [Within] Let him knock till it ache.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.

LUCE

    [Within] What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?

ADRIANA

    [Within] Who is that at the door that keeps all
    this noise?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] By my troth, your town is troubled with
    unruly boys.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Are you there, wife? you might have come before.

ADRIANA

    [Within] Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.

ANGELO

    Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
    fain have either.

BALTHAZAR

    In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
    Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
    It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Break any breaking here, and I'll break your
    knave's pate.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
    Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon
    thee, hind!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,
    let me in.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    [Within] Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
    For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
    If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.

BALTHAZAR

    Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
    Herein you war against your reputation
    And draw within the compass of suspect
    The unviolated honour of your wife.
    Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
    Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
    Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
    And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
    Why at this time the doors are made against you.
    Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
    And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
    And about evening come yourself alone
    To know the reason of this strange restraint.
    If by strong hand you offer to break in
    Now in the stirring passage of the day,
    A vulgar comment will be made of it,
    And that supposed by the common rout
    Against your yet ungalled estimation
    That may with foul intrusion enter in
    And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
    For slander lives upon succession,
    For ever housed where it gets possession.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
    And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
    I know a wench of excellent discourse,
    Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
    There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
    My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
    Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
    To her will we to dinner.

    To Angelo
    Get you home
    And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
    Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
    For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
    Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
    Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
    Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
    I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.

ANGELO

    I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse

LUCIANA

    And may it be that you have quite forgot
    A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
    Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
    Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
    If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
    Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
    Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
    Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
    Let not my sister read it in your eye;
    Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
    Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
    Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
    Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
    Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
    Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
    What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
    'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
    And let her read it in thy looks at board:
    Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
    Ill d eeds are doubled with an evil word.
    Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
    Being compact of credit, that you love us;
    Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
    We in your motion turn and you may move us.
    Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
    Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
    'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
    When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,
    Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
    Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
    Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.
    Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
    Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
    Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
    The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
    Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
    To make it wander in an unknown field?
    Are you a god? would you create me new?
    Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
    But if that I am I, then well I know
    Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
    Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
    Far more, far more to you do I decline.
    O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
    To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:
    Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
    Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
    And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
    And in that glorious supposition think
    He gains by death that hath such means to die:
    Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!

LUCIANA

    What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.

LUCIANA

    It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.

LUCIANA

    Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.

LUCIANA

    Why call you me love? call my sister so.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thy sister's sister.

LUCIANA

    That's my sister.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    No;
    It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
    Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
    My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,
    My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.

LUCIANA

    All this my sister is, or else should be.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
    Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:
    Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
    Give me thy hand.

LUCIANA

    O, soft, air! hold you still:
    I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.

    Exit

    Enter DROMIO of Syracuse
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?
    am I myself?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.

ANTIPHOLUS

    What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one
    that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What claim lays she to thee?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your
    horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I
    being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
    being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What is she?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may
    not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have
    but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
    wondrous fat marriage.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    How dost thou mean a fat marriage?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;
    and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
    lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I
    warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
    Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,
    she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What complexion is she of?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so
    clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over
    shoes in the grime of it.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    That's a fault that water will mend.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What's her name?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's
    an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from
    hip to hip.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Then she bears some breadth?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:
    she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out
    countries in her.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    In what part of her body stands Ireland?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where Scotland?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where France?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war
    against her heir.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where England?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no
    whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,
    by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where Spain?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where America, the Indies?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with
    rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich
    aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole
    armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this
    drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me
    Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what
    privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my
    shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my
    left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:
    And, I think, if my breast had not been made of
    faith and my heart of steel,
    She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made
    me turn i' the wheel.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
    An if the wind blow any way from shore,
    I will not harbour in this town to-night:
    If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
    Where I will walk till thou return to me.
    If every one knows us and we know none,
    'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    As from a bear a man would run for life,
    So fly I from her that would be my wife.

    Exit
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    There's none but witches do inhabit here;
    And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
    She that doth call me husband, even my soul
    Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
    Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
    Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
    Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
    But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
    I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.

    Enter ANGELO with the chain

ANGELO

    Master Antipholus,--
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Ay, that's my name.

ANGELO

    I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.
    I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:
    The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What is your will that I shall do with this?

ANGELO

    What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.

ANGELO

    Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
    Go home with it and please your wife withal;
    And soon at supper-time I'll visit you
    And then receive my money for the chain.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
    For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.

ANGELO

    You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.

    Exit
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What I should think of this, I cannot tell:
    But this I think, there's no man is so vain
    That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
    I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
    When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
    I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay
    If any ship put out, then straight away.

    Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. A public place.

    Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer

Second Merchant

    You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
    And since I have not much importuned you;
    Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
    To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:
    Therefore make present satisfaction,
    Or I'll attach you by this officer.

ANGELO

    Even just the sum that I do owe to you
    Is growing to me by Antipholus,
    And in the instant that I met with you
    He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
    I shall receive the money for the same.
    Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
    I will discharge my bond and thank you too.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus from the courtezan's

Officer

    That labour may you save: see where he comes.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
    And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
    Among my wife and her confederates,
    For locking me out of my doors by day.
    But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
    Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.

    Exit
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
    I promised your presence and the chain;
    But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
    Belike you thought our love would last too long,
    If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.

ANGELO

    Saving your merry humour, here's the note
    How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
    The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.
    Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
    Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
    I pray you, see him presently discharged,
    For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I am not furnish'd with the present money;
    Besides, I have some business in the town.
    Good signior, take the stranger to my house
    And with you take the chain and bid my wife
    Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
    Perchance I will be there as soon as you.

ANGELO

    Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.

ANGELO

    Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
    Or else you may return without your money.

ANGELO

    Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
    Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
    And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
    Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
    I should have chid you for not bringing it,
    But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.

Second Merchant

    The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.

ANGELO

    You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.

ANGELO

    Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
    Either send the chain or send me by some token.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
    where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.

Second Merchant

    My business cannot brook this dalliance.
    Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:
    If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I answer you! what should I answer you?

ANGELO

    The money that you owe me for the chain.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I owe you none till I receive the chain.

ANGELO

    You know I gave it you half an hour since.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.

ANGELO

    You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
    Consider how it stands upon my credit.

Second Merchant

    Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.

Officer

    I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.

ANGELO

    This touches me in reputation.
    Either consent to pay this sum for me
    Or I attach you by this officer.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Consent to pay thee that I never had!
    Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.

ANGELO

    Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,
    I would not spare my brother in this case,
    If he should scorn me so apparently.

Officer

    I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
    But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
    As all the metal in your shop will answer.

ANGELO

    Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,
    To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.

    Enter DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
    That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
    And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
    I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
    The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.
    The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
    Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
    But for their owner, master, and yourself.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
    What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
    And told thee to what purpose and what end.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
    You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I will debate this matter at more leisure
    And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
    To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:
    Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
    That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
    There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:
    Tell her I am arrested in the street
    And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!
    On, officer, to prison till it come.

    Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and Antipholus of Ephesus

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    To Adriana! that is where we dined,
    Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:
    She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
    Thither I must, although against my will,
    For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

    Exit

SCENE II. The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.

    Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA

ADRIANA

    Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
    Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
    That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
    Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
    What observation madest thou in this case
    Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?

LUCIANA

    First he denied you had in him no right.

ADRIANA

    He meant he did me none; the more my spite.

LUCIANA

    Then swore he that he was a stranger here.

ADRIANA

    And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.

LUCIANA

    Then pleaded I for you.

ADRIANA

    And what said he?

LUCIANA

    That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.

ADRIANA

    With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?

LUCIANA

    With words that in an honest suit might move.
    First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.

ADRIANA

    Didst speak him fair?

LUCIANA

    Have patience, I beseech.

ADRIANA

    I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;
    My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
    He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,
    Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
    Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
    Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.

LUCIANA

    Who would be jealous then of such a one?
    No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.

ADRIANA

    Ah, but I think him better than I say,
    And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
    Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:
    My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.

    Enter DROMIO of Syracuse

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.

LUCIANA

    How hast thou lost thy breath?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    By running fast.

ADRIANA

    Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
    A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
    One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
    A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
    A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;
    A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that
    countermands
    The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;
    A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;
    One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.

ADRIANA

    Why, man, what is the matter?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.

ADRIANA

    What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
    But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
    Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?

ADRIANA

    Go fetch it, sister.

    Exit Luciana
    This I wonder at,
    That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.
    Tell me, was he arrested on a band?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
    A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?

ADRIANA

    What, the chain?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:
    It was two ere I left him, and now the clock
    strikes one.

ADRIANA

    The hours come back! that did I never hear.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for
    very fear.

ADRIANA

    As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's
    worth, to season.
    Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
    That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
    If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
    Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?

    Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse

ADRIANA

    Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;
    And bring thy master home immediately.
    Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--
    Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A public place.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse

    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
    As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
    And every one doth call me by my name.
    Some tender money to me; some invite me;
    Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
    Some offer me commodities to buy:
    Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
    And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
    And therewithal took measure of my body.
    Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
    And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.

    Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have
    you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam
    that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's
    skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came
    behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you
    forsake your liberty.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I understand thee not.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a
    bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
    that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob
    and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed
    men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up
    his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
    morris-pike.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    What, thou meanest an officer?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings
    any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that
    thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God
    give you good rest!'
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the
    bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were
    you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy
    Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to
    deliver you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    The fellow is distract, and so am I;
    And here we wander in illusions:
    Some blessed power deliver us from hence!

    Enter a Courtezan

Courtezan

    Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
    I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:
    Is that the chain you promised me to-day?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, is this Mistress Satan?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    It is the devil.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here
    she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof
    comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as
    much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is
    written, they appear to men like angels of light:
    light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;
    ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.

Courtezan

    Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
    Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a
    long spoon.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Why, Dromio?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with
    the devil.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?
    Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:
    I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.

Courtezan

    Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
    Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,
    And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
    A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
    A nut, a cherry-stone;
    But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
    Master, be wise: an if you give it her,
    The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.

Courtezan

    I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:
    I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.

    Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse

Courtezan

    Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
    Else would he never so demean himself.
    A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
    And for the same he promised me a chain:
    Both one and other he denies me now.
    The reason that I gather he is mad,
    Besides this present instance of his rage,
    Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
    Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
    Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
    On purpose shut the doors against his way.
    My way is now to hie home to his house,
    And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
    He rush'd into my house and took perforce
    My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
    For forty ducats is too much to lose.

    Exit

SCENE IV. A street.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer

    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
    I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
    To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
    My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
    And will not lightly trust the messenger
    That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
    I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.

    Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end
    Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
    How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    But where's the money?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.

    Beating him

Officer

    Good sir, be patient.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.

Officer

    Good, now, hold thy tongue.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Thou whoreson, senseless villain!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
    your blows.

ANTIPHOLUS

    Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an
    ass.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long
    ears. I have served him from the hour of my
    nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
    hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
    heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
    with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
    raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
    it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
    I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
    beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
    lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.

    Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or
    rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the
    rope's-end.'
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Wilt thou still talk?

    Beating him

Courtezan

    How say you now? is not your husband mad?

ADRIANA

    His incivility confirms no less.
    Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;
    Establish him in his true sense again,
    And I will please you what you will demand.

LUCIANA

    Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!

Courtezan

    Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!

PINCH

    Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.

    Striking him

PINCH

    I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,
    To yield possession to my holy prayers
    And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:
    I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.

ADRIANA

    O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    You minion, you, are these your customers?
    Did this companion with the saffron face
    Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
    Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
    And I denied to enter in my house?

ADRIANA

    O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
    Where would you had remain'd until this time,
    Free from these slanders and this open shame!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    And did not she herself revile me there?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    And did not I in rage depart from thence?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
    That since have felt the vigour of his rage.

ADRIANA

    Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?

PINCH

    It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
    And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.

ADRIANA

    Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
    By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
    But surely master, not a rag of money.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?

ADRIANA

    He came to me and I deliver'd it.

LUCIANA

    And I am witness with her that she did.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    God and the rope-maker bear me witness
    That I was sent for nothing but a rope!

PINCH

    Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
    I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
    They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
    And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?

ADRIANA

    I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    And, gentle master, I received no gold;
    But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.

ADRIANA

    Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
    And art confederate with a damned pack
    To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
    But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
    That would behold in me this shameful sport.

    Enter three or four, and offer to bind him. He strives

ADRIANA

    O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.

PINCH

    More company! The fiend is strong within him.

LUCIANA

    Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
    I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
    To make a rescue?

Officer

    Masters, let him go
    He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.

PINCH

    Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.

    They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus

ADRIANA

    What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
    Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
    Do outrage and displeasure to himself?

Officer

    He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
    The debt he owes will be required of me.

ADRIANA

    I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
    Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
    And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
    Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
    Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    O most unhappy strumpet!

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:
    cry 'The devil!'

LUCIANA

    God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!

ADRIANA

    Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.

    Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and Courtezan
    Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?

Officer

    One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?

ADRIANA

    I know the man. What is the sum he owes?

Officer

    Two hundred ducats.

ADRIANA

    Say, how grows it due?

Officer

    Due for a chain your husband had of him.

ADRIANA

    He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.

Courtezan

    When as your husband all in rage to-day
    Came to my house and took away my ring--
    The ring I saw upon his finger now--
    Straight after did I meet him with a chain.

ADRIANA

    It may be so, but I did never see it.
    Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
    I long to know the truth hereof at large.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn, and DROMIO of Syracuse

LUCIANA

    God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.

ADRIANA

    And come with naked swords.
    Let's call more help to have them bound again.

Officer

    Away! they'll kill us.

    Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I see these witches are afraid of swords.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    She that would be your wife now ran from you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
    I long that we were safe and sound aboard.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us
    no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:
    methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
    the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
    me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
    turn witch.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I will not stay to-night for all the town;
    Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. A street before a Priory.

    Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO

ANGELO

    I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;
    But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
    Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.

Second Merchant

    How is the man esteemed here in the city?

ANGELO

    Of very reverend reputation, sir,
    Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
    Second to none that lives here in the city:
    His word might bear my wealth at any time.

Second Merchant

    Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse

ANGELO

    'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
    Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
    Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
    Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
    That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
    And, not without some scandal to yourself,
    With circumstance and oaths so to deny
    This chain which now you wear so openly:
    Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
    You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
    Who, but for staying on our controversy,
    Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
    This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I think I had; I never did deny it.

Second Merchant

    Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?

Second Merchant

    These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.
    Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest
    To walk where any honest man resort.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
    I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
    Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.

Second Merchant

    I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.

    They draw

    Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and others

ADRIANA

    Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
    Some get within him, take his sword away:
    Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!
    This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!

    Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse to the Priory

    Enter the Lady Abbess, AEMILIA

AEMELIA

    Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?

ADRIANA

    To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
    Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
    And bear him home for his recovery.

ANGELO

    I knew he was not in his perfect wits.

Second Merchant

    I am sorry now that I did draw on him.

AEMELIA

    How long hath this possession held the man?

ADRIANA

    This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
    And much different from the man he was;
    But till this afternoon his passion
    Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.

AEMELIA

    Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
    Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
    Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
    A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
    Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
    Which of these sorrows is he subject to?

ADRIANA

    To none of these, except it be the last;
    Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.

AEMELIA

    You should for that have reprehended him.

ADRIANA

    Why, so I did.

AEMELIA

    Ay, but not rough enough.

ADRIANA

    As roughly as my modesty would let me.

AEMELIA

    Haply, in private.

ADRIANA

    And in assemblies too.

AEMELIA

    Ay, but not enough.

ADRIANA

    It was the copy of our conference:
    In bed he slept not for my urging it;
    At board he fed not for my urging it;
    Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
    In company I often glanced it;
    Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.

AEMELIA

    And thereof came it that the man was mad.
    The venom clamours of a jealous woman
    Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
    It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
    And therefore comes it that his head is light.
    Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
    Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
    Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
    And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
    Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
    Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
    But moody and dull melancholy,
    Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
    And at her heels a huge infectious troop
    Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
    In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
    To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
    The consequence is then thy jealous fits
    Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.

LUCIANA

    She never reprehended him but mildly,
    When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.
    Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?

ADRIANA

    She did betray me to my own reproof.
    Good people enter and lay hold on him.

AEMELIA

    No, not a creature enters in my house.

ADRIANA

    Then let your servants bring my husband forth.

AEMELIA

    Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
    And it shall privilege him from your hands
    Till I have brought him to his wits again,
    Or lose my labour in assaying it.

ADRIANA

    I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
    Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
    And will have no attorney but myself;
    And therefore let me have him home with me.

AEMELIA

    Be patient; for I will not let him stir
    Till I have used the approved means I have,
    With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
    To make of him a formal man again:
    It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
    A charitable duty of my order.
    Therefore depart and leave him here with me.

ADRIANA

    I will not hence and leave my husband here:
    And ill it doth beseem your holiness
    To separate the husband and the wife.

AEMELIA

    Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.

    Exit

LUCIANA

    Complain unto the duke of this indignity.

ADRIANA

    Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet
    And never rise until my tears and prayers
    Have won his grace to come in person hither
    And take perforce my husband from the abbess.

Second Merchant

    By this, I think, the dial points at five:
    Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person
    Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
    The place of death and sorry execution,
    Behind the ditches of the abbey here.

ANGELO

    Upon what cause?

Second Merchant

    To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
    Who put unluckily into this bay
    Against the laws and statutes of this town,
    Beheaded publicly for his offence.

ANGELO

    See where they come: we will behold his death.

LUCIANA

    Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.

    Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the Headsman and other Officers

DUKE SOLINUS

    Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
    If any friend will pay the sum for him,
    He shall not die; so much we tender him.

ADRIANA

    Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!

DUKE SOLINUS

    She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
    It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.

ADRIANA

    May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,
    Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
    At your important letters,--this ill day
    A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
    That desperately he hurried through the street,
    With him his bondman, all as mad as he--
    Doing displeasure to the citizens
    By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
    Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
    Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
    Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
    That here and there his fury had committed.
    Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
    He broke from those that had the guard of him;
    And with his mad attendant and himself,
    Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
    Met us again and madly bent on us,
    Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
    We came again to bind them. Then they fled
    Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:
    And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
    And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
    Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
    Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
    Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
    And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
    When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
    To do him all the grace and good I could.
    Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate
    And bid the lady abbess come to me.
    I will determine this before I stir.

    Enter a Servant

Servant

    O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
    My master and his man are both broke loose,
    Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor
    Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
    And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
    Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
    My master preaches patience to him and the while
    His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,
    And sure, unless you send some present help,
    Between them they will kill the conjurer.

ADRIANA

    Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
    And that is false thou dost report to us.

Servant

    Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
    I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
    He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
    To scorch your face and to disfigure you.

    Cry within
    Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!

DUKE SOLINUS

    Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!

ADRIANA

    Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,
    That he is borne about invisible:
    Even now we housed him in the abbey here;
    And now he's there, past thought of human reason.

    Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!
    Even for the service that long since I did thee,
    When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
    Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
    That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.

AEGEON

    Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
    I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
    She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,
    That hath abused and dishonour'd me
    Even in the strength and height of injury!
    Beyond imagination is the wrong
    That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
    While she with harlots feasted in my house.

DUKE SOLINUS

    A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?

ADRIANA

    No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
    To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
    As this is false he burdens me withal!

LUCIANA

    Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
    But she tells to your highness simple truth!

ANGELO

    O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
    In this the madman justly chargeth them.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    My liege, I am advised what I say,
    Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
    Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
    Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
    This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
    That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
    Could witness it, for he was with me then;
    Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
    Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
    Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
    Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
    I went to seek him: in the street I met him
    And in his company that gentleman.
    There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
    That I this day of him received the chain,
    Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
    He did arrest me with an officer.
    I did obey, and sent my peasant home
    For certain ducats: he with none return'd
    Then fairly I bespoke the officer
    To go in person with me to my house.
    By the way we met
    My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
    Of vile confederates. Along with them
    They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
    A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
    A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
    A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
    A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
    Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
    And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
    And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
    Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
    They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
    And in a dark and dankish vault at home
    There left me and my man, both bound together;
    Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
    I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
    Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
    To give me ample satisfaction
    For these deep shames and great indignities.

ANGELO

    My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
    That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.

DUKE SOLINUS

    But had he such a chain of thee or no?

ANGELO

    He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
    These people saw the chain about his neck.

Second Merchant

    Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
    Heard you confess you had the chain of him
    After you first forswore it on the mart:
    And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
    And then you fled into this abbey here,
    From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I never came within these abbey-walls,
    Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
    I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
    And this is false you burden me withal.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
    I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
    If here you housed him, here he would have been;
    If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
    You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
    Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.

Courtezan

    He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?

Courtezan

    As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
    I think you are all mated or stark mad.

    Exit one to Abbess

AEGEON

    Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
    Haply I see a friend will save my life
    And pay the sum that may deliver me.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.

AEGEON

    Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
    And is not that your bondman, Dromio?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
    But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
    Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.

AEGEON

    I am sure you both of you remember me.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
    For lately we were bound, as you are now
    You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?

AEGEON

    Why look you strange on me? you know me well.

ANTIPHOLUS

    I never saw you in my life till now.

AEGEON

    O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
    And careful hours with time's deformed hand
    Have written strange defeatures in my face:
    But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Neither.

AEGEON

    Dromio, nor thou?

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    No, trust me, sir, nor I.

AEGEON

    I am sure thou dost.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a
    man denies, you are now bound to believe him.

AEGEON

    Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
    Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
    In seven short years, that here my only son
    Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
    Though now this grained face of mine be hid
    In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
    And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
    Yet hath my night of life some memory,
    My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
    My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
    All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
    Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I never saw my father in my life.

AEGEON

    But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
    Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
    Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    The duke and all that know me in the city
    Can witness with me that it is not so
    I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.

DUKE SOLINUS

    I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
    Have I been patron to Antipholus,
    During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:
    I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.

    Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse

AEMELIA

    Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.

    All gather to see them

ADRIANA

    I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.

DUKE SOLINUS

    One of these men is Genius to the other;
    And so of these. Which is the natural man,
    And which the spirit? who deciphers them?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    O, my old master! who hath bound him here?

AEMELIA

    Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds
    And gain a husband by his liberty.
    Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man
    That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia
    That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
    O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,
    And speak unto the same AEmilia!

AEGEON

    If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:
    If thou art she, tell me where is that son
    That floated with thee on the fatal raft?

AEMELIA

    By men of Epidamnum he and I
    And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
    But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
    By force took Dromio and my son from them
    And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
    What then became of them I cannot tell
    I to this fortune that you see me in.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Why, here begins his morning story right;
    These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
    And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
    Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
    These are the parents to these children,
    Which accidentally are met together.
    Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.

DUKE SOLINUS

    Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    And I with him.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
    Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.

ADRIANA

    Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I, gentle mistress.

ADRIANA

    And are not you my husband?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    No; I say nay to that.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    And so do I; yet did she call me so:
    And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
    Did call me brother.

    To Luciana
    What I told you then,
    I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
    If this be not a dream I see and hear.

ANGELO

    That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.

ANGELO

    I think I did, sir; I deny it not.

ADRIANA

    I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
    By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    No, none by me.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    This purse of ducats I received from you,
    And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
    I see we still did meet each other's man,
    And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
    And thereupon these errors are arose.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    These ducats pawn I for my father here.

DUKE SOLINUS

    It shall not need; thy father hath his life.

Courtezan

    Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.

AEMELIA

    Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
    To go with us into the abbey here
    And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:
    And all that are assembled in this place,
    That by this sympathized one day's error
    Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
    And we shall make full satisfaction.
    Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
    Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
    My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
    The duke, my husband and my children both,
    And you the calendars of their nativity,
    Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;
    After so long grief, such festivity!

DUKE SOLINUS

    With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.

    Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF EPHESUS

    Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
    ANTIPHOLUS

OF SYRACUSE

    He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:
    Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
    Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.

    Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    There is a fat friend at your master's house,
    That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:
    She now shall be my sister, not my wife.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:
    I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
    Will you walk in to see their gossiping?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    Not I, sir; you are my elder.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    That's a question: how shall we try it?

DROMIO OF SYRACUSE

    We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.

DROMIO OF EPHESUS

    Nay, then, thus:
    We came into the world like brother and brother;
    And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.

    Exeunt

Cymbeline

ACT I
SCENE I. Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.

    Enter two Gentlemen

First Gentleman

    You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
    No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
    Still seem as does the king.

Second Gentleman

    But what's the matter?

First Gentleman

    His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
    He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
    That late he married--hath referr'd herself
    Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;
    Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all
    Is outward sorrow; though I think the king
    Be touch'd at very heart.

Second Gentleman

    None but the king?

First Gentleman

    He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,
    That most desired the match; but not a courtier,
    Although they wear their faces to the bent
    Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not
    Glad at the thing they scowl at.

Second Gentleman

    And why so?

First Gentleman

    He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
    Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
    I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
    And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
    As, to seek through the regions of the earth
    For one his like, there would be something failing
    In him that should compare. I do not think
    So fair an outward and such stuff within
    Endows a man but he.

Second Gentleman

    You speak him far.

First Gentleman

    I do extend him, sir, within himself,
    Crush him together rather than unfold
    His measure duly.

Second Gentleman

    What's his name and birth?

First Gentleman

    I cannot delve him to the root: his father
    Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
    Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
    But had his titles by Tenantius whom
    He served with glory and admired success,
    So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
    And had, besides this gentleman in question,
    Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
    Died with their swords in hand; for which
    their father,
    Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
    That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
    Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
    As he was born. The king he takes the babe
    To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
    Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
    Puts to him all the learnings that his time
    Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
    As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
    And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--
    Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
    A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
    A glass that feated them, and to the graver
    A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
    For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
    Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
    By her election may be truly read
    What kind of man he is.

Second Gentleman

    I honour him
    Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
    Is she sole child to the king?

First Gentleman

    His only child.
    He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,
    Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,
    I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
    Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
    Which way they went.

Second Gentleman

    How long is this ago?

First Gentleman

    Some twenty years.

Second Gentleman

    That a king's children should be so convey'd,
    So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
    That could not trace them!

First Gentleman

    Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
    Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
    Yet is it true, sir.

Second Gentleman

    I do well believe you.

First Gentleman

    We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,
    The queen, and princess.

    Exeunt

    Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN

QUEEN

    No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,
    After the slander of most stepmothers,
    Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but
    Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
    That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
    So soon as I can win the offended king,
    I will be known your advocate: marry, yet
    The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
    You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
    Your wisdom may inform you.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Please your highness,
    I will from hence to-day.

QUEEN

    You know the peril.
    I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
    The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king
    Hath charged you should not speak together.

    Exit

IMOGEN

    O
    Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
    Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
    I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--
    Always reserved my holy duty--what
    His rage can do on me: you must be gone;
    And I shall here abide the hourly shot
    Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
    But that there is this jewel in the world
    That I may see again.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    My queen! my mistress!
    O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
    To be suspected of more tenderness
    Than doth become a man. I will remain
    The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:
    My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
    Who to my father was a friend, to me
    Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,
    And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
    Though ink be made of gall.

    Re-enter QUEEN

QUEEN

    Be brief, I pray you:
    If the king come, I shall incur I know not
    How much of his displeasure.

    Aside
    Yet I'll move him
    To walk this way: I never do him wrong,
    But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
    Pays dear for my offences.

    Exit

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Should we be taking leave
    As long a term as yet we have to live,
    The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!

IMOGEN

    Nay, stay a little:
    Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
    Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;
    This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;
    But keep it till you woo another wife,
    When Imogen is dead.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    How, how! another?
    You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
    And sear up my embracements from a next
    With bonds of death!

    Putting on the ring
    Remain, remain thou here
    While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
    As I my poor self did exchange for you,
    To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
    I still win of you: for my sake wear this;
    It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
    Upon this fairest prisoner.

    Putting a bracelet upon her arm

IMOGEN

    O the gods!
    When shall we see again?

    Enter CYMBELINE and Lords

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Alack, the king!

CYMBELINE

    Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!
    If after this command thou fraught the court
    With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!
    Thou'rt poison to my blood.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    The gods protect you!
    And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.

    Exit

IMOGEN

    There cannot be a pinch in death
    More sharp than this is.

CYMBELINE

    O disloyal thing,
    That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
    A year's age on me.

IMOGEN

    I beseech you, sir,
    Harm not yourself with your vexation
    I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
    Subdues all pangs, all fears.

CYMBELINE

    Past grace? obedience?

IMOGEN

    Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.

CYMBELINE

    That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!

IMOGEN

    O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,
    And did avoid a puttock.

CYMBELINE

    Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne
    A seat for baseness.

IMOGEN

    No; I rather added
    A lustre to it.

CYMBELINE

    O thou vile one!

IMOGEN

    Sir,
    It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:
    You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
    A man worth any woman, overbuys me
    Almost the sum he pays.

CYMBELINE

    What, art thou mad?

IMOGEN

    Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were
    A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
    Our neighbour shepherd's son!

CYMBELINE

    Thou foolish thing!

    Re-enter QUEEN
    They were again together: you have done
    Not after our command. Away with her,
    And pen her up.

QUEEN

    Beseech your patience. Peace,
    Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,
    Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort
    Out of your best advice.

CYMBELINE

    Nay, let her languish
    A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,
    Die of this folly!

    Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords

QUEEN

    Fie! you must give way.

    Enter PISANIO
    Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?

PISANIO

    My lord your son drew on my master.

QUEEN

    Ha!
    No harm, I trust, is done?

PISANIO

    There might have been,
    But that my master rather play'd than fought
    And had no help of anger: they were parted
    By gentlemen at hand.

QUEEN

    I am very glad on't.

IMOGEN

    Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
    To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
    I would they were in Afric both together;
    Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
    The goer-back. Why came you from your master?

PISANIO

    On his command: he would not suffer me
    To bring him to the haven; left these notes
    Of what commands I should be subject to,
    When 't pleased you to employ me.

QUEEN

    This hath been
    Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour
    He will remain so.

PISANIO

    I humbly thank your highness.

QUEEN

    Pray, walk awhile.

IMOGEN

    About some half-hour hence,
    I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
    Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. A public place.

    Enter CLOTEN and two Lords

First Lord

    Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the
    violence of action hath made you reek as a
    sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
    there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.

CLOTEN

    If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?

Second Lord

    [Aside] No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.

First Lord

    Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be
    not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.

Second Lord

    [Aside] His steel was in debt; it went o' the
    backside the town.

CLOTEN

    The villain would not stand me.

Second Lord

    [Aside] No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.

First Lord

    Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
    he added to your having; gave you some ground.

Second Lord

    [Aside] As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!

CLOTEN

    I would they had not come between us.

Second Lord

    [Aside] So would I, till you had measured how long
    a fool you were upon the ground.

CLOTEN

    And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!

Second Lord

    [Aside] If it be a sin to make a true election, she
    is damned.

First Lord

    Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain
    go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen
    small reflection of her wit.

Second Lord

    [Aside] She shines not upon fools, lest the
    reflection should hurt her.

CLOTEN

    Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some
    hurt done!

Second Lord

    [Aside] I wish not so; unless it had been the fall
    of an ass, which is no great hurt.

CLOTEN

    You'll go with us?

First Lord

    I'll attend your lordship.

CLOTEN

    Nay, come, let's go together.

Second Lord

    Well, my lord.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.

    Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO

IMOGEN

    I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,
    And question'dst every sail: if he should write
    And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
    As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
    That he spake to thee?

PISANIO

    It was his queen, his queen!

IMOGEN

    Then waved his handkerchief?

PISANIO

    And kiss'd it, madam.

IMOGEN

    Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!
    And that was all?

PISANIO

    No, madam; for so long
    As he could make me with this eye or ear
    Distinguish him from others, he did keep
    The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
    Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind
    Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
    How swift his ship.

IMOGEN

    Thou shouldst have made him
    As little as a crow, or less, ere left
    To after-eye him.

PISANIO

    Madam, so I did.

IMOGEN

    I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but
    To look upon him, till the diminution
    Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,
    Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
    The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
    Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
    When shall we hear from him?

PISANIO

    Be assured, madam,
    With his next vantage.

IMOGEN

    I did not take my leave of him, but had
    Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
    How I would think on him at certain hours
    Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
    The shes of Italy should not betray
    Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,
    At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
    To encounter me with orisons, for then
    I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
    Give him that parting kiss which I had set
    Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father
    And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
    Shakes all our buds from growing.

    Enter a Lady

Lady

    The queen, madam,
    Desires your highness' company.

IMOGEN

    Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
    I will attend the queen.

PISANIO

    Madam, I shall.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.

    Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a Dutchman, and a Spaniard

IACHIMO

    Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was
    then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy
    as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I
    could then have looked on him without the help of
    admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments
    had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.

PHILARIO

    You speak of him when he was less furnished than now
    he is with that which makes him both without and within.

Frenchman

    I have seen him in France: we had very many there
    could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.

IACHIMO

    This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein
    he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,
    words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.

Frenchman

    And then his banishment.

IACHIMO

    Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this
    lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
    to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,
    which else an easy battery might lay flat, for
    taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes
    it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
    acquaintance?

PHILARIO

    His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I
    have been often bound for no less than my life.
    Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained
    amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your
    knowing, to a stranger of his quality.

    Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
    I beseech you all, be better known to this
    gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend
    of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
    hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.

Frenchman

    Sir, we have known together in Orleans.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
    which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.

Frenchman

    Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I
    did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity
    you should have been put together with so mortal a
    purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so
    slight and trivial a nature.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;
    rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
    my every action to be guided by others' experiences:
    but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say
    it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.

Frenchman

    'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,
    and by such two that would by all likelihood have
    confounded one the other, or have fallen both.

IACHIMO

    Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?

Frenchman

    Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,
    which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.
    It was much like an argument that fell out last
    night, where each of us fell in praise of our
    country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
    vouching--and upon warrant of bloody
    affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,
    chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable
    than any the rarest of our ladies in France.

IACHIMO

    That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's
    opinion by this worn out.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    She holds her virtue still and I my mind.

IACHIMO

    You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would
    abate her nothing, though I profess myself her
    adorer, not her friend.

IACHIMO

    As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
    comparison--had been something too fair and too good
    for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
    I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres
    many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
    excelled many: but I have not seen the most
    precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.

IACHIMO

    What do you esteem it at?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    More than the world enjoys.

IACHIMO

    Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's
    outprized by a trifle.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if
    there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit
    for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,
    and only the gift of the gods.

IACHIMO

    Which the gods have given you?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Which, by their graces, I will keep.

IACHIMO

    You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,
    strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
    ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
    estimations; the one is but frail and the other
    casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished
    courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
    to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the
    holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do
    nothing doubt you have store of thieves;
    notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.

PHILARIO

    Let us leave here, gentlemen.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I
    thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.

IACHIMO

    With five times so much conversation, I should get
    ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even
    to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    No, no.

IACHIMO

    I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
    your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it
    something: but I make my wager rather against your
    confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your
    offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
    lady in the world.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    You are a great deal abused in too bold a
    persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're
    worthy of by your attempt.

IACHIMO

    What's that?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,
    deserve more; a punishment too.

PHILARIO

    Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;
    let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be
    better acquainted.

IACHIMO

    Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
    approbation of what I have spoke!

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    What lady would you choose to assail?

IACHIMO

    Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.
    I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,
    that, commend me to the court where your lady is,
    with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
    second conference, and I will bring from thence
    that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring
    I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.

IACHIMO

    You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy
    ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot
    preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
    religion in you, that you fear.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a
    graver purpose, I hope.

IACHIMO

    I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo
    what's spoken, I swear.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your
    return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my
    mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
    unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.

PHILARIO

    I will have it no lay.

IACHIMO

    By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no
    sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
    bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats
    are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,
    and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,
    she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are
    yours: provided I have your commendation for my more
    free entertainment.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    I embrace these conditions; let us have articles
    betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if
    you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
    to understand you have prevailed, I am no further
    your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she
    remain unseduced, you not making it appear
    otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you
    have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
    your sword.

IACHIMO

    Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set
    down by lawful counsel, and straight away for
    Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and
    starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two
    wagers recorded.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Agreed.

    Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO

Frenchman

    Will this hold, think you?

PHILARIO

    Signior Iachimo will not from it.
    Pray, let us follow 'em.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.

    Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS

QUEEN

    Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;
    Make haste: who has the note of them?

First Lady

    I, madam.

QUEEN

    Dispatch.

    Exeunt Ladies
    Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?

CORNELIUS

    Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:

    Presenting a small box
    But I beseech your grace, without offence,--
    My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have
    Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,
    Which are the movers of a languishing death;
    But though slow, deadly?

QUEEN

    I wonder, doctor,
    Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
    Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
    To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
    That our great king himself doth woo me oft
    For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--
    Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet
    That I did amplify my judgment in
    Other conclusions? I will try the forces
    Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
    We count not worth the hanging, but none human,
    To try the vigour of them and apply
    Allayments to their act, and by them gather
    Their several virtues and effects.

CORNELIUS

    Your highness
    Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:
    Besides, the seeing these effects will be
    Both noisome and infectious.

QUEEN

    O, content thee.

    Enter PISANIO

    Aside
    Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
    Will I first work: he's for his master,
    An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!
    Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
    Take your own way.

CORNELIUS

    [Aside] I do suspect you, madam;
    But you shall do no harm.

QUEEN

    [To PISANIO] Hark thee, a word.

CORNELIUS

    [Aside] I do not like her. She doth think she has
    Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,
    And will not trust one of her malice with
    A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
    Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;
    Which first, perchance, she'll prove on
    cats and dogs,
    Then afterward up higher: but there is
    No danger in what show of death it makes,
    More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
    To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
    With a most false effect; and I the truer,
    So to be false with her.

QUEEN

    No further service, doctor,
    Until I send for thee.

CORNELIUS

    I humbly take my leave.

    Exit

QUEEN

    Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time
    She will not quench and let instructions enter
    Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:
    When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
    I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
    As great as is thy master, greater, for
    His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
    Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor
    Continue where he is: to shift his being
    Is to exchange one misery with another,
    And every day that comes comes to decay
    A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,
    To be depender on a thing that leans,
    Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,
    So much as but to prop him?

    The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up
    Thou takest up
    Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:
    It is a thing I made, which hath the king
    Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know
    What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;
    It is an earnest of a further good
    That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
    The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
    Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
    Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,
    Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king
    To any shape of thy preferment such
    As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
    That set thee on to this desert, am bound
    To load thy merit richly. Call my women:
    Think on my words.

    Exit PISANIO
    A sly and constant knave,
    Not to be shaked; the agent for his master
    And the remembrancer of her to hold
    The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
    Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
    Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,
    Except she bend her humour, shall be assured
    To taste of too.

    Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies
    So, so: well done, well done:
    The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
    Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
    Think on my words.

    Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies

PISANIO

    And shall do:
    But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
    I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.

    Exit

SCENE VI. The same. Another room in the palace.

    Enter IMOGEN

IMOGEN

    A father cruel, and a step-dame false;
    A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,
    That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!
    My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
    Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,
    As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
    Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,
    How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
    Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!

    Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO

PISANIO

    Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
    Comes from my lord with letters.

IACHIMO

    Change you, madam?
    The worthy Leonatus is in safety
    And greets your highness dearly.

    Presents a letter

IMOGEN

    Thanks, good sir:
    You're kindly welcome.

IACHIMO

    [Aside] All of her that is out of door most rich!
    If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
    She is alone the Arabian bird, and I
    Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
    Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
    Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
    Rather directly fly.

IMOGEN

    [Reads] 'He is one of the noblest note, to whose
    kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon
    him accordingly, as you value your trust--
    LEONATUS.'
    So far I read aloud:
    But even the very middle of my heart
    Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.
    You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
    Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
    In all that I can do.

IACHIMO

    Thanks, fairest lady.
    What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
    To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop
    Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
    The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
    Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
    Partition make with spectacles so precious
    'Twixt fair and foul?

IMOGEN

    What makes your admiration?

IACHIMO

    It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys
    'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
    Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,
    For idiots in this case of favour would
    Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;
    Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
    Should make desire vomit emptiness,
    Not so allured to feed.

IMOGEN

    What is the matter, trow?

IACHIMO

    The cloyed will,
    That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
    Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb
    Longs after for the garbage.

IMOGEN

    What, dear sir,
    Thus raps you? Are you well?

IACHIMO

    Thanks, madam; well.

    To PISANIO
    Beseech you, sir, desire
    My man's abode where I did leave him: he
    Is strange and peevish.

PISANIO

    I was going, sir,
    To give him welcome.

    Exit

IMOGEN

    Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?

IACHIMO

    Well, madam.

IMOGEN

    Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.

IACHIMO

    Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
    So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd
    The Briton reveller.

IMOGEN

    When he was here,
    He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
    Not knowing why.

IACHIMO

    I never saw him sad.
    There is a Frenchman his companion, one
    An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves
    A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces
    The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--
    Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,
    Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows
    By history, report, or his own proof,
    What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
    But must be, will his free hours languish for
    Assured bondage?'

IMOGEN

    Will my lord say so?

IACHIMO

    Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:
    It is a recreation to be by
    And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,
    Some men are much to blame.

IMOGEN

    Not he, I hope.

IACHIMO

    Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
    Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;
    In you, which I account his beyond all talents,
    Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
    To pity too.

IMOGEN

    What do you pity, sir?

IACHIMO

    Two creatures heartily.

IMOGEN

    Am I one, sir?
    You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
    Deserves your pity?

IACHIMO

    Lamentable! What,
    To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
    I' the dungeon by a snuff?

IMOGEN

    I pray you, sir,
    Deliver with more openness your answers
    To my demands. Why do you pity me?

IACHIMO

    That others do--
    I was about to say--enjoy your--But
    It is an office of the gods to venge it,
    Not mine to speak on 't.

IMOGEN

    You do seem to know
    Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--
    Since doubling things go ill often hurts more
    Than to be sure they do; for certainties
    Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
    The remedy then born--discover to me
    What both you spur and stop.

IACHIMO

    Had I this cheek
    To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
    Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
    To the oath of loyalty; this object, which
    Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
    Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
    Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
    That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
    Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as
    With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
    Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
    That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit
    That all the plagues of hell should at one time
    Encounter such revolt.

IMOGEN

    My lord, I fear,
    Has forgot Britain.

IACHIMO

    And himself. Not I,
    Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
    The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces
    That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
    Charms this report out.

IMOGEN

    Let me hear no more.

IACHIMO

    O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
    With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady
    So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
    Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd
    With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition
    Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures
    That play with all infirmities for gold
    Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
    As well might poison poison! Be revenged;
    Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
    Recoil from your great stock.

IMOGEN

    Revenged!
    How should I be revenged? If this be true,--
    As I have such a heart that both mine ears
    Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,
    How should I be revenged?

IACHIMO

    Should he make me
    Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
    Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
    In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
    I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
    More noble than that runagate to your bed,
    And will continue fast to your affection,
    Still close as sure.

IMOGEN

    What, ho, Pisanio!

IACHIMO

    Let me my service tender on your lips.

IMOGEN

    Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
    So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
    Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
    For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.
    Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
    From thy report as thou from honour, and
    Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
    Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
    The king my father shall be made acquainted
    Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
    A saucy stranger in his court to mart
    As in a Romish stew and to expound
    His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
    He little cares for and a daughter who
    He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!

IACHIMO

    O happy Leonatus! I may say
    The credit that thy lady hath of thee
    Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
    Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!
    A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
    Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
    For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
    I have spoke this, to know if your affiance
    Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,
    That which he is, new o'er: and he is one
    The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
    That he enchants societies into him;
    Half all men's hearts are his.

IMOGEN

    You make amends.

IACHIMO

    He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
    He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
    More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
    Most mighty princess, that I have adventured
    To try your taking a false report; which hath
    Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
    In the election of a sir so rare,
    Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him
    Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,
    Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.

IMOGEN

    All's well, sir: take my power i' the court
    for yours.

IACHIMO

    My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
    To entreat your grace but in a small request,
    And yet of moment to, for it concerns
    Your lord; myself and other noble friends,
    Are partners in the business.

IMOGEN

    Pray, what is't?

IACHIMO

    Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
    The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
    To buy a present for the emperor
    Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
    In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels
    Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;
    And I am something curious, being strange,
    To have them in safe stowage: may it please you
    To take them in protection?

IMOGEN

    Willingly;
    And pawn mine honour for their safety: since
    My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
    In my bedchamber.

IACHIMO

    They are in a trunk,
    Attended by my men: I will make bold
    To send them to you, only for this night;
    I must aboard to-morrow.

IMOGEN

    O, no, no.

IACHIMO

    Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
    By lengthening my return. From Gallia
    I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
    To see your grace.

IMOGEN

    I thank you for your pains:
    But not away to-morrow!

IACHIMO

    O, I must, madam:
    Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
    To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:
    I have outstood my time; which is material
    To the tender of our present.

IMOGEN

    I will write.
    Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
    And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.

    Enter CLOTEN and two Lords

CLOTEN

    Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the
    jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a
    hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes
    must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine
    oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.

First Lord

    What got he by that? You have broke his pate with
    your bowl.

Second Lord

    [Aside] If his wit had been like him that broke it,
    it would have run all out.

CLOTEN

    When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for
    any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?

Second Lord

    No my lord;

    Aside
    nor crop the ears of them.

CLOTEN

    Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?
    Would he had been one of my rank!

Second Lord

    [Aside] To have smelt like a fool.

CLOTEN

    I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a
    pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;
    they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my
    mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of
    fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that
    nobody can match.

Second Lord

    [Aside] You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
    cock, with your comb on.

CLOTEN

    Sayest thou?

Second Lord

    It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
    companion that you give offence to.

CLOTEN

    No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit
    offence to my inferiors.

Second Lord

    Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.

CLOTEN

    Why, so I say.

First Lord

    Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?

CLOTEN

    A stranger, and I not know on't!

Second Lord

    [Aside] He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
    not.

First Lord

    There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of
    Leonatus' friends.

CLOTEN

    Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,
    whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?

First Lord

    One of your lordship's pages.

CLOTEN

    Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no
    derogation in't?

Second Lord

    You cannot derogate, my lord.

CLOTEN

    Not easily, I think.

Second Lord

    [Aside] You are a fool granted; therefore your
    issues, being foolish, do not derogate.

CLOTEN

    Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost
    to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.

Second Lord

    I'll attend your lordship.

    Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord
    That such a crafty devil as is his mother
    Should yield the world this ass! a woman that
    Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
    Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
    And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
    Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,
    Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
    A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
    More hateful than the foul expulsion is
    Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
    Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm
    The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked
    That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,
    To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!

    Exit

SCENE II. Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace:

    a trunk in one corner of it.

    IMOGEN in bed, reading; a Lady attending

IMOGEN

    Who's there? my woman Helen?

Lady

    Please you, madam

IMOGEN

    What hour is it?

Lady

    Almost midnight, madam.

IMOGEN

    I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:
    Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:
    Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
    And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,
    I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly

    Exit Lady
    To your protection I commend me, gods.
    From fairies and the tempters of the night
    Guard me, beseech ye.

    Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk

IACHIMO

    The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense
    Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
    Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd
    The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
    How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,
    And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
    But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
    How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
    Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper
    Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,
    To see the enclosed lights, now canopied
    Under these windows, white and azure laced
    With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,
    To note the chamber: I will write all down:
    Such and such pictures; there the window; such
    The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,
    Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.
    Ah, but some natural notes about her body,
    Above ten thousand meaner moveables
    Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.
    O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
    And be her sense but as a monument,
    Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:

    Taking off her bracelet
    As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
    'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
    As strongly as the conscience does within,
    To the madding of her lord. On her left breast
    A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
    I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,
    Stronger than ever law could make: this secret
    Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
    The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
    Why should I write this down, that's riveted,
    Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
    The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
    Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:
    To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
    Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
    May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
    Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.

    Clock strikes
    One, two, three: time, time!

    Goes into the trunk. The scene closes

Scene III

    An ante-chamber adjoining Imogen's apartments.

    Enter CLOTEN and Lords

First Lord

    Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the
    most coldest that ever turned up ace.

CLOTEN

    It would make any man cold to lose.

First Lord

    But not every man patient after the noble temper of
    your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.

CLOTEN

    Winning will put any man into courage. If I could
    get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.
    It's almost morning, is't not?

First Lord

    Day, my lord.

CLOTEN

    I would this music would come: I am advised to give
    her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.

    Enter Musicians
    Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your
    fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if none
    will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.
    First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;
    after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich
    words to it: and then let her consider.

    SONG
    Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
    And Phoebus 'gins arise,
    His steeds to water at those springs
    On chaliced flowers that lies;
    And winking Mary-buds begin
    To ope their golden eyes:
    With every thing that pretty is,
    My lady sweet, arise:
    Arise, arise.

CLOTEN

    So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will
    consider your music the better: if it do not, it is
    a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and
    calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
    boot, can never amend.

    Exeunt Musicians

Second Lord

    Here comes the king.

CLOTEN

    I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I
    was up so early: he cannot choose but take this
    service I have done fatherly.

    Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN
    Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.

CYMBELINE

    Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
    Will she not forth?

CLOTEN

    I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.

CYMBELINE

    The exile of her minion is too new;
    She hath not yet forgot him: some more time
    Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
    And then she's yours.

QUEEN

    You are most bound to the king,
    Who lets go by no vantages that may
    Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
    To orderly soliciting, and be friended
    With aptness of the season; make denials
    Increase your services; so seem as if
    You were inspired to do those duties which
    You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
    Save when command to your dismission tends,
    And therein you are senseless.

CLOTEN

    Senseless! not so.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
    The one is Caius Lucius.

CYMBELINE

    A worthy fellow,
    Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
    But that's no fault of his: we must receive him
    According to the honour of his sender;
    And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
    We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
    When you have given good morning to your mistress,
    Attend the queen and us; we shall have need
    To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.

    Exeunt all but CLOTEN

CLOTEN

    If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,
    Let her lie still and dream.

    Knocks
    By your leave, ho!
    I Know her women are about her: what
    If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
    Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes
    Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up
    Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold
    Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;
    Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what
    Can it not do and undo? I will make
    One of her women lawyer to me, for
    I yet not understand the case myself.

    Knocks
    By your leave.

    Enter a Lady

Lady

    Who's there that knocks?

CLOTEN

    A gentleman.

Lady

    No more?

CLOTEN

    Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.

Lady

    That's more
    Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,
    Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?

CLOTEN

    Your lady's person: is she ready?

Lady

    Ay,
    To keep her chamber.

CLOTEN

    There is gold for you;
    Sell me your good report.

Lady

    How! my good name? or to report of you
    What I shall think is good?--The princess!

    Enter IMOGEN

CLOTEN

    Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.

    Exit Lady

IMOGEN

    Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
    For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give
    Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
    And scarce can spare them.

CLOTEN

    Still, I swear I love you.

IMOGEN

    If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:
    If you swear still, your recompense is still
    That I regard it not.

CLOTEN

    This is no answer.

IMOGEN

    But that you shall not say I yield being silent,
    I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,
    I shall unfold equal discourtesy
    To your best kindness: one of your great knowing
    Should learn, being taught, forbearance.

CLOTEN

    To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:
    I will not.

IMOGEN

    Fools are not mad folks.

CLOTEN

    Do you call me fool?

IMOGEN

    As I am mad, I do:
    If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;
    That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
    You put me to forget a lady's manners,
    By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,
    That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
    By the very truth of it, I care not for you,
    And am so near the lack of charity--
    To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather
    You felt than make't my boast.

CLOTEN

    You sin against
    Obedience, which you owe your father. For
    The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
    One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,
    With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:
    And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--
    Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,
    On whom there is no more dependency
    But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;
    Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
    The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil
    The precious note of it with a base slave.
    A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
    A pantler, not so eminent.

IMOGEN

    Profane fellow
    Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
    But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
    To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,
    Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
    Comparative for your virtues, to be styled
    The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated
    For being preferred so well.

CLOTEN

    The south-fog rot him!

IMOGEN

    He never can meet more mischance than come
    To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,
    That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer
    In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
    Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!

CLOTEN

    'His garment!' Now the devil--

IMOGEN

    To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--

CLOTEN

    'His garment!'

IMOGEN

    I am sprited with a fool.
    Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman
    Search for a jewel that too casually
    Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,
    If I would lose it for a revenue
    Of any king's in Europe. I do think
    I saw't this morning: confident I am
    Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:
    I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
    That I kiss aught but he.

PISANIO

    'Twill not be lost.

IMOGEN

    I hope so: go and search.

    Exit PISANIO

CLOTEN

    You have abused me:
    'His meanest garment!'

IMOGEN

    Ay, I said so, sir:
    If you will make't an action, call witness to't.

CLOTEN

    I will inform your father.

IMOGEN

    Your mother too:
    She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,
    But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,
    To the worst of discontent.

    Exit

CLOTEN

    I'll be revenged:
    'His meanest garment!' Well.

    CYMBELINE

SCENE IV. Rome. Philario's house.

    Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure
    To win the king as I am bold her honour
    Will remain hers.

PHILARIO

    What means do you make to him?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Not any, but abide the change of time,
    Quake in the present winter's state and wish
    That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,
    I barely gratify your love; they failing,
    I must die much your debtor.

PHILARIO

    Your very goodness and your company
    O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king
    Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius
    Will do's commission throughly: and I think
    He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,
    Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
    Is yet fresh in their grief.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    I do believe,
    Statist though I am none, nor like to be,
    That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
    The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
    In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
    Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
    Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
    Smiled at their lack of skill, but found
    their courage
    Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,
    Now mingled with their courages, will make known
    To their approvers they are people such
    That mend upon the world.

    Enter IACHIMO

PHILARIO

    See! Iachimo!

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    The swiftest harts have posted you by land;
    And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
    To make your vessel nimble.

PHILARIO

    Welcome, sir.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    I hope the briefness of your answer made
    The speediness of your return.

IACHIMO

    Your lady
    Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    And therewithal the best; or let her beauty
    Look through a casement to allure false hearts
    And be false with them.

IACHIMO

    Here are letters for you.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Their tenor good, I trust.

IACHIMO

    'Tis very like.

PHILARIO

    Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
    When you were there?

IACHIMO

    He was expected then,
    But not approach'd.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    All is well yet.
    Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not
    Too dull for your good wearing?

IACHIMO

    If I had lost it,
    I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
    I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy
    A second night of such sweet shortness which
    Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    The stone's too hard to come by.

IACHIMO

    Not a whit,
    Your lady being so easy.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Make not, sir,
    Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we
    Must not continue friends.

IACHIMO

    Good sir, we must,
    If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
    The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
    We were to question further: but I now
    Profess myself the winner of her honour,
    Together with your ring; and not the wronger
    Of her or you, having proceeded but
    By both your wills.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    If you can make't apparent
    That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
    And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion
    You had of her pure honour gains or loses
    Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both
    To who shall find them.

IACHIMO

    Sir, my circumstances,
    Being so near the truth as I will make them,
    Must first induce you to believe: whose strength
    I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,
    You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find
    You need it not.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Proceed.

IACHIMO

    First, her bedchamber,--
    Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess
    Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd
    With tapesty of silk and silver; the story
    Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,
    And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
    The press of boats or pride: a piece of work
    So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
    In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd
    Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
    Since the true life on't was--

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    This is true;
    And this you might have heard of here, by me,
    Or by some other.

IACHIMO

    More particulars
    Must justify my knowledge.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    So they must,
    Or do your honour injury.

IACHIMO

    The chimney
    Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece
    Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures
    So likely to report themselves: the cutter
    Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,
    Motion and breath left out.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    This is a thing
    Which you might from relation likewise reap,
    Being, as it is, much spoke of.

IACHIMO

    The roof o' the chamber
    With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--
    I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids
    Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
    Depending on their brands.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    This is her honour!
    Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise
    Be given to your remembrance--the description
    Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
    The wager you have laid.

IACHIMO

    Then, if you can,

    Showing the bracelet
    Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!
    And now 'tis up again: it must be married
    To that your diamond; I'll keep them.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Jove!
    Once more let me behold it: is it that
    Which I left with her?

IACHIMO

    Sir--I thank her--that:
    She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;
    Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
    And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said
    She prized it once.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    May be she pluck'd it off
    To send it me.

IACHIMO

    She writes so to you, doth she?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;

    Gives the ring
    It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
    Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour
    Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,
    Where there's another man: the vows of women
    Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,
    Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.
    O, above measure false!

PHILARIO

    Have patience, sir,
    And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:
    It may be probable she lost it; or
    Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,
    Hath stol'n it from her?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Very true;
    And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:
    Render to me some corporal sign about her,
    More evident than this; for this was stolen.

IACHIMO

    By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
    'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure
    She would not lose it: her attendants are
    All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!
    And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:
    The cognizance of her incontinency
    Is this: she hath bought the name of whore
    thus dearly.
    There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
    Divide themselves between you!

PHILARIO

    Sir, be patient:
    This is not strong enough to be believed
    Of one persuaded well of--

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Never talk on't;
    She hath been colted by him.

IACHIMO

    If you seek
    For further satisfying, under her breast--
    Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud
    Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,
    I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger
    To feed again, though full. You do remember
    This stain upon her?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Ay, and it doth confirm
    Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
    Were there no more but it.

IACHIMO

    Will you hear more?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;
    Once, and a million!

IACHIMO

    I'll be sworn--

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    No swearing.
    If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;
    And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny
    Thou'st made me cuckold.

IACHIMO

    I'll deny nothing.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!
    I will go there and do't, i' the court, before
    Her father. I'll do something--

    Exit

PHILARIO

    Quite besides
    The government of patience! You have won:
    Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath
    He hath against himself.

IACHIMO

    With an my heart.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Another room in Philario's house.

    Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Is there no way for men to be but women
    Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;
    And that most venerable man which I
    Did call my father, was I know not where
    When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools
    Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd
    The Dian of that time so doth my wife
    The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!
    Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
    And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
    A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't
    Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her
    As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!
    This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--
    Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,
    Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,
    Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition
    But what he look'd for should oppose and she
    Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
    The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
    That tends to vice in man, but I affirm
    It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,
    The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
    Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
    Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
    Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
    All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,
    Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;
    For even to vice
    They are not constant but are changing still
    One vice, but of a minute old, for one
    Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,
    Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
    In a true hate, to pray they have their will:
    The very devils cannot plague them better.

    Exit

ACT III
SCENE I. Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.

    Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, and Lords at one door, and at another, CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants

CYMBELINE

    Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?

CAIUS LUCIUS

    When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet
    Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
    Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain
    And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--
    Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less
    Than in his feats deserving it--for him
    And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
    Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately
    Is left untender'd.

QUEEN

    And, to kill the marvel,
    Shall be so ever.

CLOTEN

    There be many Caesars,
    Ere such another Julius. Britain is
    A world by itself; and we will nothing pay
    For wearing our own noses.

QUEEN

    That opportunity
    Which then they had to take from 's, to resume
    We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
    The kings your ancestors, together with
    The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
    As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in
    With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,
    With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,
    But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
    Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
    Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--
    That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried
    From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--
    Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,
    Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd
    As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof
    The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--
    O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,
    Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
    And Britons strut with courage.

CLOTEN

    Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our
    kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,
    as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of
    them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such
    straight arms, none.

CYMBELINE

    Son, let your mother end.

CLOTEN

    We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
    Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a
    hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If
    Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or
    put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute
    for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.

CYMBELINE

    You must know,
    Till the injurious Romans did extort
    This tribute from us, we were free:
    Caesar's ambition,
    Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
    The sides o' the world, against all colour here
    Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off
    Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
    Ourselves to be.

CLOTEN Lords

    We do.

CYMBELINE

    Say, then, to Caesar,
    Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
    Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar
    Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
    Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
    Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,
    Who was the first of Britain which did put
    His brows within a golden crown and call'd
    Himself a king.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    I am sorry, Cymbeline,
    That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--
    Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than
    Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:
    Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
    In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
    For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
    I thank thee for myself.

CYMBELINE

    Thou art welcome, Caius.
    Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
    Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;
    Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
    Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
    That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
    Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent
    Which not to read would show the Britons cold:
    So Caesar shall not find them.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Let proof speak.

CLOTEN

    His majesty bids you welcome. Make
    pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if
    you seek us afterwards in other terms, you
    shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you
    beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in
    the adventure, our crows shall fare the better
    for you; and there's an end.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    So, sir.

CYMBELINE

    I know your master's pleasure and he mine:
    All the remain is 'Welcome!'

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Another room in the palace.

    Enter PISANIO, with a letter

PISANIO

    How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
    What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,
    O master! what a strange infection
    Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,
    As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd
    On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:
    She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,
    More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
    As would take in some virtue. O my master!
    Thy mind to her is now as low as were
    Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?
    Upon the love and truth and vows which I
    Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?
    If it be so to do good service, never
    Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,
    That I should seem to lack humanity
    so much as this fact comes to?

    Reading
    'Do't: the letter
    that I have sent her, by her own command
    Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!
    Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,
    Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st
    So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
    I am ignorant in what I am commanded.

    Enter IMOGEN

IMOGEN

    How now, Pisanio!

PISANIO

    Madam, here is a letter from my lord.

IMOGEN

    Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!
    O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer
    That knew the stars as I his characters;
    He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,
    Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
    Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not
    That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:
    Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
    For it doth physic love: of his content,
    All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
    You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
    And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:
    Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
    You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!

    Reads
    'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me
    in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as
    you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me
    with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,
    at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of
    this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all
    happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,
    increasing in love,
    LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'
    O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
    He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me
    How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
    May plod it in a week, why may not I
    Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--
    Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--
    let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,
    But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;
    For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;
    Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
    To the smothering of the sense--how far it is
    To this same blessed Milford: and by the way
    Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
    To inherit such a haven: but first of all,
    How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
    That we shall make in time, from our hence-going
    And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:
    Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?
    We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,
    How many score of miles may we well ride
    'Twixt hour and hour?

PISANIO

    One score 'twixt sun and sun,
    Madam, 's enough for you:

    Aside
    and too much too.

IMOGEN

    Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
    Could never go so slow: I have heard of
    riding wagers,
    Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
    That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:
    Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
    She'll home to her father: and provide me presently
    A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit
    A franklin's housewife.

PISANIO

    Madam, you're best consider.

IMOGEN

    I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,
    Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,
    That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;
    Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,
    Accessible is none but Milford way.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.

    Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS following

BELARIUS

    A goodly day not to keep house, with such
    Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
    Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
    To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs
    Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
    And keep their impious turbans on, without
    Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
    We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly
    As prouder livers do.

GUIDERIUS

    Hail, heaven!

ARVIRAGUS

    Hail, heaven!

BELARIUS

    Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;
    Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,
    When you above perceive me like a crow,
    That it is place which lessens and sets off;
    And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
    Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:
    This service is not service, so being done,
    But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,
    Draws us a profit from all things we see;
    And often, to our comfort, shall we find
    The sharded beetle in a safer hold
    Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life
    Is nobler than attending for a cheque,
    Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,
    Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
    Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,
    Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.

GUIDERIUS

    Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,
    Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not
    What air's from home. Haply this life is best,
    If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
    That have a sharper known; well corresponding
    With your stiff age: but unto us it is
    A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;
    A prison for a debtor, that not dares
    To stride a limit.

ARVIRAGUS

    What should we speak of
    When we are old as you? when we shall hear
    The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
    In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse
    The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;
    We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,
    Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;
    Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
    We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,
    And sing our bondage freely.

BELARIUS

    How you speak!
    Did you but know the city's usuries
    And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court
    As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
    Is certain falling, or so slippery that
    The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,
    A pain that only seems to seek out danger
    I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'
    the search,
    And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
    As record of fair act; nay, many times,
    Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
    Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story
    The world may read in me: my body's mark'd
    With Roman swords, and my report was once
    First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,
    And when a soldier was the theme, my name
    Was not far off: then was I as a tree
    Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,
    A storm or robbery, call it what you will,
    Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
    And left me bare to weather.

GUIDERIUS

    Uncertain favour!

BELARIUS

    My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--
    But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
    Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
    I was confederate with the Romans: so
    Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
    This rock and these demesnes have been my world;
    Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
    More pious debts to heaven than in all
    The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!
    This is not hunters' language: he that strikes
    The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;
    To him the other two shall minister;
    And we will fear no poison, which attends
    In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.

    Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS
    How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
    These boys know little they are sons to the king;
    Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
    They think they are mine; and though train'd
    up thus meanly
    I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
    The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
    In simple and low things to prince it much
    Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
    The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
    The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!
    When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
    The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
    Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,
    And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then
    The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
    Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
    That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
    Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,
    Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
    His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!
    O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows
    Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,
    At three and two years old, I stole these babes;
    Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
    Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,
    Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for
    their mother,
    And every day do honour to her grave:
    Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,
    They take for natural father. The game is up.

    Exit

SCENE IV. Country near Milford-Haven.

    Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN

IMOGEN

    Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
    Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so
    To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!
    Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,
    That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
    From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,
    Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
    Beyond self-explication: put thyself
    Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness
    Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
    Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with
    A look untender? If't be summer news,
    Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st
    But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!
    That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
    And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue
    May take off some extremity, which to read
    Would be even mortal to me.

PISANIO

    Please you, read;
    And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
    The most disdain'd of fortune.

IMOGEN

    [Reads] 'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the
    strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie
    bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,
    but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
    as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,
    must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with
    the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away
    her life: I shall give thee opportunity at
    Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose
    where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
    it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
    equally to me disloyal.'

PISANIO

    What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper
    Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,
    Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
    Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
    Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
    All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,
    Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
    This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?

IMOGEN

    False to his bed! What is it to be false?
    To lie in watch there and to think on him?
    To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep
    charge nature,
    To break it with a fearful dream of him
    And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?

PISANIO

    Alas, good lady!

IMOGEN

    I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,
    Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
    Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks
    Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy
    Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:
    Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;
    And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,
    I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,
    Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
    By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
    Put on for villany; not born where't grows,
    But worn a bait for ladies.

PISANIO

    Good madam, hear me.

IMOGEN

    True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,
    Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping
    Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
    From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,
    Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;
    Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
    From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:
    Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,
    A little witness my obedience: look!
    I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit
    The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;
    Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
    Thy master is not there, who was indeed
    The riches of it: do his bidding; strike
    Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
    But now thou seem'st a coward.

PISANIO

    Hence, vile instrument!
    Thou shalt not damn my hand.

IMOGEN

    Why, I must die;
    And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
    No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
    There is a prohibition so divine
    That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.
    Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;
    Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
    The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,
    All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,
    Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
    Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
    Believe false teachers: though those that
    are betray'd
    Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
    Stands in worse case of woe.
    And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up
    My disobedience 'gainst the king my father
    And make me put into contempt the suits
    Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
    It is no act of common passage, but
    A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself
    To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her
    That now thou tirest on, how thy memory
    Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:
    The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
    Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
    When I desire it too.

PISANIO

    O gracious lady,
    Since I received command to do this business
    I have not slept one wink.

IMOGEN

    Do't, and to bed then.

PISANIO

    I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.

IMOGEN

    Wherefore then
    Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
    So many miles with a pretence? this place?
    Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?
    The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
    For my being absent? whereunto I never
    Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
    To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,
    The elected deer before thee?

PISANIO

    But to win time
    To lose so bad employment; in the which
    I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,
    Hear me with patience.

IMOGEN

    Talk thy tongue weary; speak
    I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear
    Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
    Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.

PISANIO

    Then, madam,
    I thought you would not back again.

IMOGEN

    Most like;
    Bringing me here to kill me.

PISANIO

    Not so, neither:
    But if I were as wise as honest, then
    My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
    But that my master is abused:
    Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.
    Hath done you both this cursed injury.

IMOGEN

    Some Roman courtezan.

PISANIO

    No, on my life.
    I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
    Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded
    I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,
    And that will well confirm it.

IMOGEN

    Why good fellow,
    What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?
    Or in my life what comfort, when I am
    Dead to my husband?

PISANIO

    If you'll back to the court--

IMOGEN

    No court, no father; nor no more ado
    With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
    That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
    As fearful as a siege.

PISANIO

    If not at court,
    Then not in Britain must you bide.

IMOGEN

    Where then
    Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
    Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume
    Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;
    In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think
    There's livers out of Britain.

PISANIO

    I am most glad
    You think of other place. The ambassador,
    Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven
    To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind
    Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
    That which, to appear itself, must not yet be
    But by self-danger, you should tread a course
    Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near
    The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least
    That though his actions were not visible, yet
    Report should render him hourly to your ear
    As truly as he moves.

IMOGEN

    O, for such means!
    Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,
    I would adventure.

PISANIO

    Well, then, here's the point:
    You must forget to be a woman; change
    Command into obedience: fear and niceness--
    The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
    Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:
    Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and
    As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must
    Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
    Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
    Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch
    Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
    Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein
    You made great Juno angry.

IMOGEN

    Nay, be brief
    I see into thy end, and am almost
    A man already.

PISANIO

    First, make yourself but like one.
    Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--
    'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all
    That answer to them: would you in their serving,
    And with what imitation you can borrow
    From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius
    Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
    wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,
    If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless
    With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable
    And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,
    You have me, rich; and I will never fail
    Beginning nor supplyment.

IMOGEN

    Thou art all the comfort
    The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:
    There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even
    All that good time will give us: this attempt
    I am soldier to, and will abide it with
    A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.

PISANIO

    Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
    Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of
    Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,
    Here is a box; I had it from the queen:
    What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,
    Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this
    Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
    And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
    Direct you to the best!

IMOGEN

    Amen: I thank thee.

    Exeunt, severally

SCENE V. A room in Cymbeline's palace.

    Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS, Lords, and Attendants

CYMBELINE

    Thus far; and so farewell.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Thanks, royal sir.
    My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;
    And am right sorry that I must report ye
    My master's enemy.

CYMBELINE

    Our subjects, sir,
    Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself
    To show less sovereignty than they, must needs
    Appear unkinglike.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    So, sir: I desire of you
    A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.
    Madam, all joy befal your grace!

QUEEN

    And you!

CYMBELINE

    My lords, you are appointed for that office;
    The due of honour in no point omit.
    So farewell, noble Lucius.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Your hand, my lord.

CLOTEN

    Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
    I wear it as your enemy.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Sir, the event
    Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.

CYMBELINE

    Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
    Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!

    Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords

QUEEN

    He goes hence frowning: but it honours us
    That we have given him cause.

CLOTEN

    'Tis all the better;
    Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.

CYMBELINE

    Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
    How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
    Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:
    The powers that he already hath in Gallia
    Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves
    His war for Britain.

QUEEN

    'Tis not sleepy business;
    But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.

CYMBELINE

    Our expectation that it would be thus
    Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,
    Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd
    Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd
    The duty of the day: she looks us like
    A thing more made of malice than of duty:
    We have noted it. Call her before us; for
    We have been too slight in sufferance.

    Exit an Attendant

QUEEN

    Royal sir,
    Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired
    Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,
    'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,
    Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady
    So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
    And strokes death to her.

    Re-enter Attendant

CYMBELINE

    Where is she, sir? How
    Can her contempt be answer'd?

Attendant

    Please you, sir,
    Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer
    That will be given to the loudest noise we make.

QUEEN

    My lord, when last I went to visit her,
    She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
    Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,
    She should that duty leave unpaid to you,
    Which daily she was bound to proffer: this
    She wish'd me to make known; but our great court
    Made me to blame in memory.

CYMBELINE

    Her doors lock'd?
    Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear
    Prove false!

    Exit

QUEEN

    Son, I say, follow the king.

CLOTEN

    That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,
    have not seen these two days.

QUEEN

    Go, look after.

    Exit CLOTEN
    Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
    He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence
    Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
    It is a thing most precious. But for her,
    Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,
    Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
    To her desired Posthumus: gone she is
    To death or to dishonour; and my end
    Can make good use of either: she being down,
    I have the placing of the British crown.

    Re-enter CLOTEN
    How now, my son!

CLOTEN

    'Tis certain she is fled.
    Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none
    Dare come about him.

QUEEN

    [Aside] All the better: may
    This night forestall him of the coming day!

    Exit

CLOTEN

    I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,
    And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
    Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one
    The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,
    Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but
    Disdaining me and throwing favours on
    The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
    That what's else rare is choked; and in that point
    I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
    To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--

    Enter PISANIO
    Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
    Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,
    Where is thy lady? In a word; or else
    Thou art straightway with the fiends.

PISANIO

    O, good my lord!

CLOTEN

    Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--
    I will not ask again. Close villain,
    I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip
    Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
    From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
    A dram of worth be drawn.

PISANIO

    Alas, my lord,
    How can she be with him? When was she missed?
    He is in Rome.

CLOTEN

    Where is she, sir? Come nearer;
    No further halting: satisfy me home
    What is become of her.

PISANIO

    O, my all-worthy lord!

CLOTEN

    All-worthy villain!
    Discover where thy mistress is at once,
    At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'
    Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
    Thy condemnation and thy death.

PISANIO

    Then, sir,
    This paper is the history of my knowledge
    Touching her flight.

    Presenting a letter

CLOTEN

    Let's see't. I will pursue her
    Even to Augustus' throne.

PISANIO

    [Aside] Or this, or perish.
    She's far enough; and what he learns by this
    May prove his travel, not her danger.

CLOTEN

    Hum!

PISANIO

    [Aside] I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,
    Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!

CLOTEN

    Sirrah, is this letter true?

PISANIO

    Sir, as I think.

CLOTEN

    It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou
    wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,
    undergo those employments wherein I should have
    cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,
    what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it
    directly and truly, I would think thee an honest
    man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
    relief nor my voice for thy preferment.

PISANIO

    Well, my good lord.

CLOTEN

    Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and
    constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
    that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the
    course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of
    mine: wilt thou serve me?

PISANIO

    Sir, I will.

CLOTEN

    Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy
    late master's garments in thy possession?

PISANIO

    I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he
    wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.

CLOTEN

    The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit
    hither: let it be thy lint service; go.

PISANIO

    I shall, my lord.

    Exit

CLOTEN

    Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one
    thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou
    villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these
    garments were come. She said upon a time--the
    bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she
    held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect
    than my noble and natural person together with the
    adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my
    back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her
    eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then
    be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my
    speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and
    when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex
    her I will execute in the clothes that she so
    praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot
    her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,
    and I'll be merry in my revenge.

    Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes
    Be those the garments?

PISANIO

    Ay, my noble lord.

CLOTEN

    How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?

PISANIO

    She can scarce be there yet.

CLOTEN

    Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second
    thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,
    that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be
    but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself
    to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had
    wings to follow it! Come, and be true.

    Exit

PISANIO

    Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee
    Were to prove false, which I will never be,
    To him that is most true. To Milford go,
    And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
    You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed
    Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!

    Exit

SCENE VI. Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.

    Enter IMOGEN, in boy's clothes

IMOGEN

    I see a man's life is a tedious one:
    I have tired myself, and for two nights together
    Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,
    But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
    When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,
    Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think
    Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
    Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me
    I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,
    That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
    A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
    When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
    Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood
    Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
    Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,
    My hunger's gone; but even before, I was
    At point to sink for food. But what is this?
    Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:
    I were best not to call; I dare not call:
    yet famine,
    Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,
    Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever
    Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
    If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,
    Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.
    Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy
    But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.
    Such a foe, good heavens!

    Exit, to the cave

    Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

BELARIUS

    You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and
    Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I
    Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:
    The sweat of industry would dry and die,
    But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs
    Will make what's homely savoury: weariness
    Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
    Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,
    Poor house, that keep'st thyself!

GUIDERIUS

    I am thoroughly weary.

ARVIRAGUS

    I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.

GUIDERIUS

    There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,
    Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.

BELARIUS

    [Looking into the cave]
    Stay; come not in.
    But that it eats our victuals, I should think
    Here were a fairy.

GUIDERIUS

    What's the matter, sir?

BELARIUS

    By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,
    An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
    No elder than a boy!

    Re-enter IMOGEN

IMOGEN

    Good masters, harm me not:
    Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought
    To have begg'd or bought what I have took:
    good troth,
    I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found
    Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:
    I would have left it on the board so soon
    As I had made my meal, and parted
    With prayers for the provider.

GUIDERIUS

    Money, youth?

ARVIRAGUS

    All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!
    As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those
    Who worship dirty gods.

IMOGEN

    I see you're angry:
    Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
    Have died had I not made it.

BELARIUS

    Whither bound?

IMOGEN

    To Milford-Haven.

BELARIUS

    What's your name?

IMOGEN

    Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
    Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;
    To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
    I am fall'n in this offence.

BELARIUS

    Prithee, fair youth,
    Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds
    By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!
    'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer
    Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.
    Boys, bid him welcome.

GUIDERIUS

    Were you a woman, youth,
    I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,
    I bid for you as I'd buy.

ARVIRAGUS

    I'll make't my comfort
    He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:
    And such a welcome as I'd give to him
    After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!
    Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.

IMOGEN

    'Mongst friends,
    If brothers.

    Aside
    Would it had been so, that they
    Had been my father's sons! then had my prize
    Been less, and so more equal ballasting
    To thee, Posthumus.

BELARIUS

    He wrings at some distress.

GUIDERIUS

    Would I could free't!

ARVIRAGUS

    Or I, whate'er it be,
    What pain it cost, what danger. God's!

BELARIUS

    Hark, boys.

    Whispering

IMOGEN

    Great men,
    That had a court no bigger than this cave,
    That did attend themselves and had the virtue
    Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by
    That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--
    Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
    I'd change my sex to be companion with them,
    Since Leonatus's false.

BELARIUS

    It shall be so.
    Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:
    Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,
    We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,
    So far as thou wilt speak it.

GUIDERIUS

    Pray, draw near.

ARVIRAGUS

    The night to the owl and morn to the lark
    less welcome.

IMOGEN

    Thanks, sir.

ARVIRAGUS

    I pray, draw near.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. Rome. A public place.

    Enter two Senators and Tribunes

First Senator

    This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:
    That since the common men are now in action
    'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
    And that the legions now in Gallia are
    Full weak to undertake our wars against
    The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite
    The gentry to this business. He creates
    Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,
    For this immediate levy, he commends
    His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!

First Tribune

    Is Lucius general of the forces?

Second Senator

    Ay.

First Tribune

    Remaining now in Gallia?

First Senator

    With those legions
    Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
    Must be supplyant: the words of your commission
    Will tie you to the numbers and the time
    Of their dispatch.

First Tribune

    We will discharge our duty.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Wales: near the cave of Belarius.

    Enter CLOTEN

CLOTEN

    I am near to the place where they should meet, if
    Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments
    serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by
    him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the
    rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said
    a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must
    play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it
    is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer
    in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are
    as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,
    not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the
    advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike
    conversant in general services, and more remarkable
    in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant
    thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!
    Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy
    shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy
    mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before
    thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her
    father; who may haply be a little angry for my so
    rough usage; but my mother, having power of his
    testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My
    horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore
    purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is
    the very description of their meeting-place; and
    the fellow dares not deceive me.

    Exit

SCENE II. Before the cave of Belarius.

    Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN

BELARIUS

    [To IMOGEN] You are not well: remain here in the cave;
    We'll come to you after hunting.

ARVIRAGUS

    [To IMOGEN] Brother, stay here
    Are we not brothers?

IMOGEN

    So man and man should be;
    But clay and clay differs in dignity,
    Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.

GUIDERIUS

    Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.

IMOGEN

    So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
    But not so citizen a wanton as
    To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;
    Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom
    Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
    Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
    To one not sociable: I am not very sick,
    Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:
    I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,
    Stealing so poorly.

GUIDERIUS

    I love thee; I have spoke it
    How much the quantity, the weight as much,
    As I do love my father.

BELARIUS

    What! how! how!

ARVIRAGUS

    If it be sin to say so, I yoke me
    In my good brother's fault: I know not why
    I love this youth; and I have heard you say,
    Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,
    And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say
    'My father, not this youth.'

BELARIUS

    [Aside] O noble strain!
    O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!
    Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:
    Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
    I'm not their father; yet who this should be,
    Doth miracle itself, loved before me.
    'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.

ARVIRAGUS

    Brother, farewell.

IMOGEN

    I wish ye sport.

ARVIRAGUS

    You health. So please you, sir.

IMOGEN

    [Aside] These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies
    I have heard!
    Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:
    Experience, O, thou disprovest report!
    The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish
    Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
    I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,
    I'll now taste of thy drug.

    Swallows some

GUIDERIUS

    I could not stir him:
    He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
    Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.

ARVIRAGUS

    Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter
    I might know more.

BELARIUS

    To the field, to the field!
    We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.

ARVIRAGUS

    We'll not be long away.

BELARIUS

    Pray, be not sick,
    For you must be our housewife.

IMOGEN

    Well or ill,
    I am bound to you.

BELARIUS

    And shalt be ever.

    Exit IMOGEN, to the cave
    This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had
    Good ancestors.

ARVIRAGUS

    How angel-like he sings!

GUIDERIUS

    But his neat cookery! he cut our roots
    In characters,
    And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick
    And he her dieter.

ARVIRAGUS

    Nobly he yokes
    A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
    Was that it was, for not being such a smile;
    The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly
    From so divine a temple, to commix
    With winds that sailors rail at.

GUIDERIUS

    I do note
    That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
    Mingle their spurs together.

ARVIRAGUS

    Grow, patience!
    And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine
    His perishing root with the increasing vine!

BELARIUS

    It is great morning. Come, away!--
    Who's there?

    Enter CLOTEN

CLOTEN

    I cannot find those runagates; that villain
    Hath mock'd me. I am faint.

BELARIUS

    'Those runagates!'
    Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis
    Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.
    I saw him not these many years, and yet
    I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!

GUIDERIUS

    He is but one: you and my brother search
    What companies are near: pray you, away;
    Let me alone with him.

    Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS

CLOTEN

    Soft! What are you
    That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?
    I have heard of such. What slave art thou?

GUIDERIUS

    A thing
    More slavish did I ne'er than answering
    A slave without a knock.

CLOTEN

    Thou art a robber,
    A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.

GUIDERIUS

    To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I
    An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
    Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
    My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
    Why I should yield to thee?

CLOTEN

    Thou villain base,
    Know'st me not by my clothes?

GUIDERIUS

    No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
    Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,
    Which, as it seems, make thee.

CLOTEN

    Thou precious varlet,
    My tailor made them not.

GUIDERIUS

    Hence, then, and thank
    The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
    I am loath to beat thee.

CLOTEN

    Thou injurious thief,
    Hear but my name, and tremble.

GUIDERIUS

    What's thy name?

CLOTEN

    Cloten, thou villain.

GUIDERIUS

    Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
    I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or
    Adder, Spider,
    'Twould move me sooner.

CLOTEN

    To thy further fear,
    Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
    I am son to the queen.

GUIDERIUS

    I am sorry for 't; not seeming
    So worthy as thy birth.

CLOTEN

    Art not afeard?

GUIDERIUS

    Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:
    At fools I laugh, not fear them.

CLOTEN

    Die the death:
    When I have slain thee with my proper hand,
    I'll follow those that even now fled hence,
    And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:
    Yield, rustic mountaineer.

    Exeunt, fighting

    Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS

BELARIUS

    No companies abroad?

ARVIRAGUS

    None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.

BELARIUS

    I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,
    But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
    Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,
    And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute
    'Twas very Cloten.

ARVIRAGUS

    In this place we left them:
    I wish my brother make good time with him,
    You say he is so fell.

BELARIUS

    Being scarce made up,
    I mean, to man, he had not apprehension
    Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment
    Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.

    Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head

GUIDERIUS

    This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;
    There was no money in't: not Hercules
    Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:
    Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
    My head as I do his.

BELARIUS

    What hast thou done?

GUIDERIUS

    I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,
    Son to the queen, after his own report;
    Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
    With his own single hand he'ld take us in
    Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,
    And set them on Lud's-town.

BELARIUS

    We are all undone.

GUIDERIUS

    Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,
    But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
    Protects not us: then why should we be tender
    To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
    Play judge and executioner all himself,
    For we do fear the law? What company
    Discover you abroad?

BELARIUS

    No single soul
    Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason
    He must have some attendants. Though his humour
    Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that
    From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not
    Absolute madness could so far have raved
    To bring him here alone; although perhaps
    It may be heard at court that such as we
    Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
    May make some stronger head; the which he hearing--
    As it is like him--might break out, and swear
    He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable
    To come alone, either he so undertaking,
    Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,
    If we do fear this body hath a tail
    More perilous than the head.

ARVIRAGUS

    Let ordinance
    Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,
    My brother hath done well.

BELARIUS

    I had no mind
    To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness
    Did make my way long forth.

GUIDERIUS

    With his own sword,
    Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
    His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek
    Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,
    And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:
    That's all I reck.

    Exit

BELARIUS

    I fear 'twill be revenged:
    Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour
    Becomes thee well enough.

ARVIRAGUS

    Would I had done't
    So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,
    I love thee brotherly, but envy much
    Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,
    That possible strength might meet, would seek us through
    And put us to our answer.

BELARIUS

    Well, 'tis done:
    We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger
    Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;
    You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay
    Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him
    To dinner presently.

ARVIRAGUS

    Poor sick Fidele!
    I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour
    I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,
    And praise myself for charity.

    Exit

BELARIUS

    O thou goddess,
    Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st
    In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
    As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
    Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
    Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,
    That by the top doth take the mountain pine,
    And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder
    That an invisible instinct should frame them
    To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,
    Civility not seen from other, valour
    That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
    As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
    What Cloten's being here to us portends,
    Or what his death will bring us.

    Re-enter GUIDERIUS

GUIDERIUS

    Where's my brother?
    I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
    In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage
    For his return.

    Solemn music

BELARIUS

    My ingenious instrument!
    Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion
    Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!

GUIDERIUS

    Is he at home?

BELARIUS

    He went hence even now.

GUIDERIUS

    What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother
    it did not speak before. All solemn things
    Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
    Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
    Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
    Is Cadwal mad?

BELARIUS

    Look, here he comes,
    And brings the dire occasion in his arms
    Of what we blame him for.

    Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead, bearing her in his arms

ARVIRAGUS

    The bird is dead
    That we have made so much on. I had rather
    Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,
    To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,
    Than have seen this.

GUIDERIUS

    O sweetest, fairest lily!
    My brother wears thee not the one half so well
    As when thou grew'st thyself.

BELARIUS

    O melancholy!
    Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
    The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare
    Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!
    Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,
    Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.
    How found you him?

ARVIRAGUS

    Stark, as you see:
    Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,
    Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his
    right cheek
    Reposing on a cushion.

GUIDERIUS

    Where?

ARVIRAGUS

    O' the floor;
    His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put
    My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
    Answer'd my steps too loud.

GUIDERIUS

    Why, he but sleeps:
    If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;
    With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
    And worms will not come to thee.

ARVIRAGUS

    With fairest flowers
    Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
    I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack
    The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor
    The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor
    The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,
    Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,
    With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming
    Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
    Without a monument!--bring thee all this;
    Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,
    To winter-ground thy corse.

GUIDERIUS

    Prithee, have done;
    And do not play in wench-like words with that
    Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
    And not protract with admiration what
    Is now due debt. To the grave!

ARVIRAGUS

    Say, where shall's lay him?

GUIDERIUS

    By good Euriphile, our mother.

ARVIRAGUS

    Be't so:
    And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
    Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,
    As once our mother; use like note and words,
    Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.

GUIDERIUS

    Cadwal,
    I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;
    For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
    Than priests and fanes that lie.

ARVIRAGUS

    We'll speak it, then.

BELARIUS

    Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten
    Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;
    And though he came our enemy, remember
    He was paid for that: though mean and
    mighty, rotting
    Together, have one dust, yet reverence,
    That angel of the world, doth make distinction
    Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely
    And though you took his life, as being our foe,
    Yet bury him as a prince.

GUIDERIUS

    Pray You, fetch him hither.
    Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',
    When neither are alive.

ARVIRAGUS

    If you'll go fetch him,
    We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.

    Exit BELARIUS

GUIDERIUS

    Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;
    My father hath a reason for't.

ARVIRAGUS

    'Tis true.

GUIDERIUS

    Come on then, and remove him.

ARVIRAGUS

    So. Begin.

    SONG

GUIDERIUS

    Fear no more the heat o' the sun,
    Nor the furious winter's rages;
    Thou thy worldly task hast done,
    Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:
    Golden lads and girls all must,
    As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.

ARVIRAGUS

    Fear no more the frown o' the great;
    Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;
    Care no more to clothe and eat;
    To thee the reed is as the oak:
    The sceptre, learning, physic, must
    All follow this, and come to dust.

GUIDERIUS

    Fear no more the lightning flash,

ARVIRAGUS

    Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;

GUIDERIUS

    Fear not slander, censure rash;

ARVIRAGUS

    Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:

GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS

    All lovers young, all lovers must
    Consign to thee, and come to dust.

GUIDERIUS

    No exorciser harm thee!

ARVIRAGUS

    Nor no witchcraft charm thee!

GUIDERIUS

    Ghost unlaid forbear thee!

ARVIRAGUS

    Nothing ill come near thee!

GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS

    Quiet consummation have;
    And renowned be thy grave!

    Re-enter BELARIUS, with the body of CLOTEN

GUIDERIUS

    We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.

BELARIUS

    Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:
    The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night
    Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.
    You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so
    These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.
    Come on, away: apart upon our knees.
    The ground that gave them first has them again:
    Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.

    Exeunt BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

IMOGEN

    [Awaking] Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is
    the way?--
    I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?
    'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--
    I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.
    But, soft! no bedfellow!--O god s and goddesses!

    Seeing the body of CLOTEN
    These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;
    This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;
    For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
    And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;
    'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
    Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes
    Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,
    I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be
    Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
    As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
    The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is
    Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.
    A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!
    I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;
    His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;
    The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face
    Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,
    All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
    And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
    Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
    Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
    Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio
    Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--
    From this most bravest vessel of the world
    Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,
    Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!
    where's that?
    Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,
    And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?
    'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them
    Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
    The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
    And cordial to me, have I not found it
    Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:
    This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!
    Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,
    That we the horrider may seem to those
    Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!

    Falls on the body

    Enter LUCIUS, a Captain and other Officers, and a Soothsayer

Captain

    To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,
    After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending
    You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
    They are in readiness.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    But what from Rome?

Captain

    The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
    And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,
    That promise noble service: and they come
    Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,
    Syenna's brother.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    When expect you them?

Captain

    With the next benefit o' the wind.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    This forwardness
    Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers
    Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,
    What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?

Soothsayer

    Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--
    I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:
    I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd
    From the spongy south to this part of the west,
    There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--
    Unless my sins abuse my divination--
    Success to the Roman host.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Dream often so,
    And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here
    Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
    It was a worthy building. How! a page!
    Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;
    For nature doth abhor to make his bed
    With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.
    Let's see the boy's face.

Captain

    He's alive, my lord.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,
    Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
    They crave to be demanded. Who is this
    Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he
    That, otherwise than noble nature did,
    Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest
    In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?
    What art thou?

IMOGEN

    I am nothing: or if not,
    Nothing to be were better. This was my master,
    A very valiant Briton and a good,
    That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
    There is no more such masters: I may wander
    From east to occident, cry out for service,
    Try many, all good, serve truly, never
    Find such another master.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    'Lack, good youth!
    Thou movest no less with thy complaining than
    Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.

IMOGEN

    Richard du Champ.

    Aside
    If I do lie and do
    No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
    They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Thy name?

IMOGEN

    Fidele, sir.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Thou dost approve thyself the very same:
    Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
    Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
    Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,
    No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,
    Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner
    Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.

IMOGEN

    I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,
    I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
    As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
    With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,
    And on it said a century of prayers,
    Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;
    And leaving so his service, follow you,
    So please you entertain me.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Ay, good youth!
    And rather father thee than master thee.
    My friends,
    The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us
    Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
    And make him with our pikes and partisans
    A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
    By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd
    As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes
    Some falls are means the happier to arise.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in Cymbeline's palace.

    Enter CYMBELINE, Lords, PISANIO, and Attendants

CYMBELINE

    Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.

    Exit an Attendant
    A fever with the absence of her son,
    A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
    How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,
    The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
    Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
    When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
    So needful for this present: it strikes me, past
    The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,
    Who needs must know of her departure and
    Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee
    By a sharp torture.

PISANIO

    Sir, my life is yours;
    I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,
    I nothing know where she remains, why gone,
    Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,
    Hold me your loyal servant.

First Lord

    Good my liege,
    The day that she was missing he was here:
    I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
    All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
    There wants no diligence in seeking him,
    And will, no doubt, be found.

CYMBELINE

    The time is troublesome.

    To PISANIO
    We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy
    Does yet depend.

First Lord

    So please your majesty,
    The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
    Are landed on your coast, with a supply
    Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.

CYMBELINE

    Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
    I am amazed with matter.

First Lord

    Good my liege,
    Your preparation can affront no less
    Than what you hear of: come more, for more
    you're ready:
    The want is but to put those powers in motion
    That long to move.

CYMBELINE

    I thank you. Let's withdraw;
    And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
    What can from Italy annoy us; but
    We grieve at chances here. Away!

    Exeunt all but PISANIO

PISANIO

    I heard no letter from my master since
    I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:
    Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise
    To yield me often tidings: neither know I
    What is betid to Cloten; but remain
    Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
    Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.
    These present wars shall find I love my country,
    Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.
    All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:
    Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.

    Exit

SCENE IV. Wales: before the cave of Belarius.

    Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS.

GUIDERIUS

    The noise is round about us.

BELARIUS

    Let us from it.

ARVIRAGUS

    What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
    From action and adventure?

GUIDERIUS

    Nay, what hope
    Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans
    Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
    For barbarous and unnatural revolts
    During their use, and slay us after.

BELARIUS

    Sons,
    We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.
    To the king's party there's no going: newness
    Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd
    Among the bands--may drive us to a render
    Where we have lived, and so extort from's that
    Which we have done, whose answer would be death
    Drawn on with torture.

GUIDERIUS

    This is, sir, a doubt
    In such a time nothing becoming you,
    Nor satisfying us.

ARVIRAGUS

    It is not likely
    That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
    Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes
    And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
    That they will waste their time upon our note,
    To know from whence we are.

BELARIUS

    O, I am known
    Of many in the army: many years,
    Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him
    From my remembrance. And, besides, the king
    Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;
    Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
    The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless
    To have the courtesy your cradle promised,
    But to be still hot summer's tamings and
    The shrinking slaves of winter.

GUIDERIUS

    Than be so
    Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:
    I and my brother are not known; yourself
    So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,
    Cannot be question'd.

ARVIRAGUS

    By this sun that shines,
    I'll thither: what thing is it that I never
    Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,
    But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
    Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
    A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
    Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
    To look upon the holy sun, to have
    The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
    So long a poor unknown.

GUIDERIUS

    By heavens, I'll go:
    If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
    I'll take the better care, but if you will not,
    The hazard therefore due fall on me by
    The hands of Romans!

ARVIRAGUS

    So say I amen.

BELARIUS

    No reason I, since of your lives you set
    So slight a valuation, should reserve
    My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!
    If in your country wars you chance to die,
    That is my bed too, lads, an there I'll lie:
    Lead, lead.

    Aside
    The time seems long; their blood
    thinks scorn,
    Till it fly out and show them princes born.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Britain. The Roman camp.

    Enter POSTHUMUS, with a bloody handkerchief

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd
    Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,
    If each of you should take this course, how many
    Must murder wives much better than themselves
    For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
    Every good servant does not all commands:
    No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
    Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never
    Had lived to put on this: so had you saved
    The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
    Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,
    You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,
    To have them fall no more: you some permit
    To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
    And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.
    But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,
    And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither
    Among the Italian gentry, and to fight
    Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough
    That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!
    I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,
    Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me
    Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
    As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight
    Against the part I come with; so I'll die
    For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
    Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,
    Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
    Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
    More valour in me than my habits show.
    Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!
    To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin
    The fashion, less without and more within.

    Exit

SCENE II. Field of battle between the British and Roman camps.

    Enter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and the Roman Army: from the other side, the British Army; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following, like a poor soldier. They march over and go out. Then enter again, in skirmish, IACHIMO and POSTHUMUS LEONATUS he vanquisheth and disarmeth IACHIMO, and then leaves him

IACHIMO

    The heaviness and guilt within my bosom
    Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,
    The princess of this country, and the air on't
    Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,
    A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me
    In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne
    As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.
    If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
    This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
    Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.

    Exit

    The battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is taken: then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS

BELARIUS

    Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;
    The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but
    The villany of our fears.

GUIDERIUS ARVIRAGUS

    Stand, stand, and fight!

    Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGEN

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;
    For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
    As war were hoodwink'd.

IACHIMO

    'Tis their fresh supplies.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes
    Let's reinforce, or fly.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Another part of the field.

    Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord

Lord

    Camest thou from where they made the stand?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    I did.
    Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.

Lord

    I did.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,
    But that the heavens fought: the king himself
    Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
    And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying
    Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,
    Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work
    More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down
    Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling
    Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd
    With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
    To die with lengthen'd shame.

Lord

    Where was this lane?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;
    Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,
    An honest one, I warrant; who deserved
    So long a breeding as his white beard came to,
    In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,
    He, with two striplings-lads more like to run
    The country base than to commit such slaughter
    With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
    Than those for preservation cased, or shame--
    Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,
    'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:
    To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;
    Or we are Romans and will give you that
    Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
    But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'
    These three,
    Three thousand confident, in act as many--
    For three performers are the file when all
    The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'
    Accommodated by the place, more charming
    With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd
    A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,
    Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,
    turn'd coward
    But by example--O, a sin in war,
    Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
    The way that they did, and to grin like lions
    Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
    A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon
    A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly
    Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,
    The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,
    Like fragments in hard voyages, became
    The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open
    Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!
    Some slain before; some dying; some their friends
    O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,
    Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:
    Those that would die or ere resist are grown
    The mortal bugs o' the field.

Lord

    This was strange chance
    A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made
    Rather to wonder at the things you hear
    Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,
    And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:
    'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,
    Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'

Lord

    Nay, be not angry, sir.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    'Lack, to what end?
    Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;
    For if he'll do as he is made to do,
    I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
    You have put me into rhyme.

Lord

    Farewell; you're angry.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Still going?

    Exit Lord
    This is a lord! O noble misery,
    To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!
    To-day how many would have given their honours
    To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,
    And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
    Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
    Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,
    'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
    Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we
    That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him
    For being now a favourer to the Briton,
    No more a Briton, I have resumed again
    The part I came in: fight I will no more,
    But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
    Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
    Here made by the Roman; great the answer be
    Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;
    On either side I come to spend my breath;
    Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,
    But end it by some means for Imogen.

    Enter two British Captains and Soldiers

First Captain

    Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.
    'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.

Second Captain

    There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,
    That gave the affront with them.

First Captain

    So 'tis reported:
    But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    A Roman,
    Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds
    Had answer'd him.

Second Captain

    Lay hands on him; a dog!
    A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
    What crows have peck'd them here. He brags
    his service
    As if he were of note: bring him to the king.

    Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives. The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to CYMBELINE, who delivers him over to a Gaoler: then exeunt omnes

SCENE IV. A British prison.

    Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two Gaolers

First Gaoler

    You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;
    So graze as you find pasture.

Second Gaoler

    Ay, or a stomach.

    Exeunt Gaolers

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,
    think, to liberty: yet am I better
    Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather
    Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
    By the sure physician, death, who is the key
    To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd
    More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me
    The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
    Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?
    So children temporal fathers do appease;
    Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?
    I cannot do it better than in gyves,
    Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,
    If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
    No stricter render of me than my all.
    I know you are more clement than vile men,
    Who of their broken debtors take a third,
    A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
    On their abatement: that's not my desire:
    For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though
    'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:
    'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
    Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:
    You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,
    If you will take this audit, take this life,
    And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
    I'll speak to thee in silence.

    Sleeps

    Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition, SICILIUS LEONATUS, father to Posthumus Leonatus, an old man, attired like a warrior; leading in his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them: then, after other music, follow the two young Leonati, brothers to Posthumus Leonatus, with wounds as they died in the wars. They circle Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleeping

Sicilius Leonatus

    No more, thou thunder-master, show
    Thy spite on mortal flies:
    With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
    That thy adulteries
    Rates and revenges.
    Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
    Whose face I never saw?
    I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
    Attending nature's law:
    Whose father then, as men report
    Thou orphans' father art,
    Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
    From this earth-vexing smart.

Mother

    Lucina lent not me her aid,
    But took me in my throes;
    That from me was Posthumus ript,
    Came crying 'mongst his foes,
    A thing of pity!

Sicilius Leonatus

    Great nature, like his ancestry,
    Moulded the stuff so fair,
    That he deserved the praise o' the world,
    As great Sicilius' heir.

First Brother

    When once he was mature for man,
    In Britain where was he
    That could stand up his parallel;
    Or fruitful object be
    In eye of Imogen, that best
    Could deem his dignity?

Mother

    With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,
    To be exiled, and thrown
    From Leonati seat, and cast
    From her his dearest one,
    Sweet Imogen?

Sicilius Leonatus

    Why did you suffer Iachimo,
    Slight thing of Italy,
    To taint his nobler heart and brain
    With needless jealosy;
    And to become the geck and scorn
    O' th' other's villany?

Second Brother

    For this from stiller seats we came,
    Our parents and us twain,
    That striking in our country's cause
    Fell bravely and were slain,
    Our fealty and Tenantius' right
    With honour to maintain.

First Brother

    Like hardiment Posthumus hath
    To Cymbeline perform'd:
    Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,
    Why hast thou thus adjourn'd
    The graces for his merits due,
    Being all to dolours turn'd?

Sicilius Leonatus

    Thy crystal window ope; look out;
    No longer exercise
    Upon a valiant race thy harsh
    And potent injuries.

Mother

    Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
    Take off his miseries.

Sicilius Leonatus

    Peep through thy marble mansion; help;
    Or we poor ghosts will cry
    To the shining synod of the rest
    Against thy deity.

First Brother Second Brother

    Help, Jupiter; or we appeal,
    And from thy justice fly.

    Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The Apparitions fall on their knees

Jupiter

    No more, you petty spirits of region low,
    Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts
    Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,
    Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
    Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest
    Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:
    Be not with mortal accidents opprest;
    No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.
    Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
    The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;
    Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:
    His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
    Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in
    Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.
    He shall be lord of lady Imogen,
    And happier much by his affliction made.
    This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
    Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:
    and so, away: no further with your din
    Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
    Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.

    Ascends

Sicilius Leonatus

    He came in thunder; his celestial breath
    Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle
    Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is
    More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird
    Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
    As when his god is pleased.

All

    Thanks, Jupiter!

Sicilius Leonatus

    The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd
    His radiant root. Away! and, to be blest,
    Let us with care perform his great behest.

    The Apparitions vanish

Posthumus Leonatus

    [Waking] Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot
    A father to me; and thou hast created
    A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!
    Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
    And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
    On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
    Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:
    Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
    And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,
    That have this golden chance and know not why.
    What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
    Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
    Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects
    So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,
    As good as promise.

    Reads
    'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,
    without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of
    tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be
    lopped branches, which, being dead many years,
    shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock and
    freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,
    Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'
    'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
    Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;
    Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
    As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
    The action of my life is like it, which
    I'll keep, if but for sympathy.

    Re-enter First Gaoler

First Gaoler

    Come, sir, are you ready for death?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.

First Gaoler

    Hanging is the word, sir: if
    you be ready for that, you are well cooked.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    So, if I prove a good repast to the
    spectators, the dish pays the shot.

First Gaoler

    A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,
    you shall be called to no more payments, fear no
    more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of
    parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in
    flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too
    much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and
    sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain
    both empty; the brain the heavier for being too
    light, the purse too light, being drawn of
    heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be
    quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up
    thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and
    creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,
    the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and
    counters; so the acquittance follows.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    I am merrier to die than thou art to live.

First Gaoler

    Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the
    tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your
    sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he
    would change places with his officer; for, look you,
    sir, you know not which way you shall go.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Yes, indeed do I, fellow.

First Gaoler

    Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen
    him so pictured: you must either be directed by
    some that take upon them to know, or do take upon
    yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or
    jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how
    you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll
    never return to tell one.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to
    direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and
    will not use them.

First Gaoler

    What an infinite mock is this, that a man should
    have the best use of eyes to see the way of
    blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.

First Gaoler

    I'll be hang'd then.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.

    Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger

First Gaoler

    Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
    gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my
    conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,
    for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them
    too that die against their wills; so should I, if I
    were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one
    mind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers and
    gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but
    my wish hath a preferment in 't.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Cymbeline's tent.

    Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS, PISANIO, Lords, Officers, and Attendants

CYMBELINE

    Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
    Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
    That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
    Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast
    Stepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:
    He shall be happy that can find him, if
    Our grace can make him so.

BELARIUS

    I never saw
    Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
    Such precious deeds in one that promises nought
    But beggary and poor looks.

CYMBELINE

    No tidings of him?

PISANIO

    He hath been search'd among the dead and living,
    But no trace of him.

CYMBELINE

    To my grief, I am
    The heir of his reward;

    To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS
    which I will add
    To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,
    By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time
    To ask of whence you are. Report it.

BELARIUS

    Sir,
    In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:
    Further to boast were neither true nor modest,
    Unless I add, we are honest.

CYMBELINE

    Bow your knees.
    Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you
    Companions to our person and will fit you
    With dignities becoming your estates.

    Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies
    There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
    Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,
    And not o' the court of Britain.

CORNELIUS

    Hail, great king!
    To sour your happiness, I must report
    The queen is dead.

CYMBELINE

    Who worse than a physician
    Would this report become? But I consider,
    By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death
    Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?

CORNELIUS

    With horror, madly dying, like her life,
    Which, being cruel to the world, concluded
    Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd
    I will report, so please you: these her women
    Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks
    Were present when she finish'd.

CYMBELINE

    Prithee, say.

CORNELIUS

    First, she confess'd she never loved you, only
    Affected greatness got by you, not you:
    Married your royalty, was wife to your place;
    Abhorr'd your person.

CYMBELINE

    She alone knew this;
    And, but she spoke it dying, I would not
    Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.

CORNELIUS

    Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
    With such integrity, she did confess
    Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,
    But that her flight prevented it, she had
    Ta'en off by poison.

CYMBELINE

    O most delicate fiend!
    Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?

CORNELIUS

    More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
    For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,
    Should by the minute feed on life and lingering
    By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,
    By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
    O'ercome you with her show, and in time,
    When she had fitted you with her craft, to work
    Her son into the adoption of the crown:
    But, failing of her end by his strange absence,
    Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite
    Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented
    The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so
    Despairing died.

CYMBELINE

    Heard you all this, her women?

First Lady

    We did, so please your highness.

CYMBELINE

    Mine eyes
    Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;
    Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,
    That thought her like her seeming; it had
    been vicious
    To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!
    That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,
    And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!

    Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS behind, and IMOGEN
    Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that
    The Britons have razed out, though with the loss
    Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit
    That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
    Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:
    So think of your estate.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day
    Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,
    We should not, when the blood was cool,
    have threaten'd
    Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
    Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives
    May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth
    A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:
    Augustus lives to think on't: and so much
    For my peculiar care. This one thing only
    I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,
    Let him be ransom'd: never master had
    A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
    So tender over his occasions, true,
    So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join
    With my request, which I make bold your highness
    Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,
    Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,
    And spare no blood beside.

CYMBELINE

    I have surely seen him:
    His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
    Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,
    And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,
    To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:
    And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
    Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;
    Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
    The noblest ta'en.

IMOGEN

    I humbly thank your highness.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;
    And yet I know thou wilt.

IMOGEN

    No, no: alack,
    There's other work in hand: I see a thing
    Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,
    Must shuffle for itself.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    The boy disdains me,
    He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
    That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
    Why stands he so perplex'd?

CYMBELINE

    What wouldst thou, boy?
    I love thee more and more: think more and more
    What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,
    Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?

IMOGEN

    He is a Roman; no more kin to me
    Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,
    Am something nearer.

CYMBELINE

    Wherefore eyest him so?

IMOGEN

    I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
    To give me hearing.

CYMBELINE

    Ay, with all my heart,
    And lend my best attention. What's thy name?

IMOGEN

    Fidele, sir.

CYMBELINE

    Thou'rt my good youth, my page;
    I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.

    CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart

BELARIUS

    Is not this boy revived from death?

ARVIRAGUS

    One sand another
    Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
    Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?

GUIDERIUS

    The same dead thing alive.

BELARIUS

    Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;
    Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure
    He would have spoke to us.

GUIDERIUS

    But we saw him dead.

BELARIUS

    Be silent; let's see further.

PISANIO

    [Aside] It is my mistress:
    Since she is living, let the time run on
    To good or bad.

    CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward

CYMBELINE

    Come, stand thou by our side;
    Make thy demand aloud.

    To IACHIMO
    Sir, step you forth;
    Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;
    Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,
    Which is our honour, bitter torture shall
    Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.

IMOGEN

    My boon is, that this gentleman may render
    Of whom he had this ring.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    [Aside] What's that to him?

CYMBELINE

    That diamond upon your finger, say
    How came it yours?

IACHIMO

    Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
    Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.

CYMBELINE

    How! me?

IACHIMO

    I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
    Which torments me to conceal. By villany
    I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;
    Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may
    grieve thee,
    As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived
    'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?

CYMBELINE

    All that belongs to this.

IACHIMO

    That paragon, thy daughter,--
    For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits
    Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.

CYMBELINE

    My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:
    I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
    Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.

IACHIMO

    Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock
    That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed
    The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would
    Our viands had been poison'd, or at least
    Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--
    What should I say? he was too good to be
    Where ill men were; and was the best of all
    Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,
    Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
    For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
    Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming
    The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.
    Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,
    A shop of all the qualities that man
    Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,
    Fairness which strikes the eye--

CYMBELINE

    I stand on fire:
    Come to the matter.

IACHIMO

    All too soon I shall,
    Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
    Most like a noble lord in love and one
    That had a royal lover, took his hint;
    And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein
    He was as calm as virtue--he began
    His mistress' picture; which by his tongue
    being made,
    And then a mind put in't, either our brags
    Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description
    Proved us unspeaking sots.

CYMBELINE

    Nay, nay, to the purpose.

IACHIMO

    Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.
    He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
    And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,
    Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him
    Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
    Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
    In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
    By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
    No lesser of her honour confident
    Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;
    And would so, had it been a carbuncle
    Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it
    Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain
    Post I in this design: well may you, sir,
    Remember me at court; where I was taught
    Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
    'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd
    Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
    'Gan in your duller Britain operate
    Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:
    And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,
    That I return'd with simular proof enough
    To make the noble Leonatus mad,
    By wounding his belief in her renown
    With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes
    Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--
    O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
    Of secret on her person, that he could not
    But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,
    I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--
    Methinks, I see him now--

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    [Advancing] Ay, so thou dost,
    Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,
    Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
    That's due to all the villains past, in being,
    To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
    Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out
    For torturers ingenious: it is I
    That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
    By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,
    That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--
    That caused a lesser villain than myself,
    A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple
    Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.
    Spit, and throw stone s, cast mire upon me, set
    The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain
    Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and
    Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!
    My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
    Imogen, Imogen!

IMOGEN

    Peace, my lord; hear, hear--

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,
    There lie thy part.

    Striking her: she falls

PISANIO

    O, gentlemen, help!
    Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!
    You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!
    Mine honour'd lady!

CYMBELINE

    Does the world go round?

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    How come these staggers on me?

PISANIO

    Wake, my mistress!

CYMBELINE

    If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
    To death with mortal joy.

PISANIO

    How fares thy mistress?

IMOGEN

    O, get thee from my sight;
    Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!
    Breathe not where princes are.

CYMBELINE

    The tune of Imogen!

PISANIO

    Lady,
    The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
    That box I gave you was not thought by me
    A precious thing: I had it from the queen.

CYMBELINE

    New matter still?

IMOGEN

    It poison'd me.

CORNELIUS

    O gods!
    I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.
    Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio
    Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection
    Which I gave him for cordial, she is served
    As I would serve a rat.'

CYMBELINE

    What's this, Comelius?

CORNELIUS

    The queen, sir, very oft importuned me
    To temper poisons for her, still pretending
    The satisfaction of her knowledge only
    In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
    Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose
    Was of more danger, did compound for her
    A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease
    The present power of life, but in short time
    All offices of nature should again
    Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?

IMOGEN

    Most like I did, for I was dead.

BELARIUS

    My boys,
    There was our error.

GUIDERIUS

    This is, sure, Fidele.

IMOGEN

    Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
    Think that you are upon a rock; and now
    Throw me again.

    Embracing him

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Hang there like a fruit, my soul,
    Till the tree die!

CYMBELINE

    How now, my flesh, my child!
    What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?
    Wilt thou not speak to me?

IMOGEN

    [Kneeling] Your blessing, sir.

BELARIUS

    [To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS] Though you did love
    this youth, I blame ye not:
    You had a motive for't.

CYMBELINE

    My tears that fall
    Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,
    Thy mother's dead.

IMOGEN

    I am sorry for't, my lord.

CYMBELINE

    O, she was nought; and long of her it was
    That we meet here so strangely: but her son
    Is gone, we know not how nor where.

PISANIO

    My lord,
    Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
    Upon my lady's missing, came to me
    With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
    If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
    It was my instant death. By accident,
    had a feigned letter of my master's
    Then in my pocket; which directed him
    To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
    Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
    Which he enforced from me, away he posts
    With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
    My lady's honour: what became of him
    I further know not.

GUIDERIUS

    Let me end the story:
    I slew him there.

CYMBELINE

    Marry, the gods forfend!
    I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
    Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,
    Deny't again.

GUIDERIUS

    I have spoke it, and I did it.

CYMBELINE

    He was a prince.

GUIDERIUS

    A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me
    Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
    With language that would make me spurn the sea,
    If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;
    And am right glad he is not standing here
    To tell this tale of mine.

CYMBELINE

    I am sorry for thee:
    By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
    Endure our law: thou'rt dead.

IMOGEN

    That headless man
    I thought had been my lord.

CYMBELINE

    Bind the offender,
    And take him from our presence.

BELARIUS

    Stay, sir king:
    This man is better than the man he slew,
    As well descended as thyself; and hath
    More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
    Had ever scar for.

    To the Guard
    Let his arms alone;
    They were not born for bondage.

CYMBELINE

    Why, old soldier,
    Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,
    By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
    As good as we?

ARVIRAGUS

    In that he spake too far.

CYMBELINE

    And thou shalt die for't.

BELARIUS

    We will die all three:
    But I will prove that two on's are as good
    As I have given out him. My sons, I must,
    For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,
    Though, haply, well for you.

ARVIRAGUS

    Your danger's ours.

GUIDERIUS

    And our good his.

BELARIUS

    Have at it then, by leave.
    Thou hadst, great king, a subject who
    Was call'd Belarius.

CYMBELINE

    What of him? he is
    A banish'd traitor.

BELARIUS

    He it is that hath
    Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;
    I know not how a traitor.

CYMBELINE

    Take him hence:
    The whole world shall not save him.

BELARIUS

    Not too hot:
    First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
    And let it be confiscate all, so soon
    As I have received it.

CYMBELINE

    Nursing of my sons!

BELARIUS

    I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:
    Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
    Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
    These two young gentlemen, that call me father
    And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
    They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
    And blood of your begetting.

CYMBELINE

    How! my issue!

BELARIUS

    So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
    Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:
    Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
    Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd
    Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--
    For such and so they are--these twenty years
    Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I
    Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as
    Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
    Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
    Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,
    Having received the punishment before,
    For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty
    Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
    The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped
    Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
    Here are your sons again; and I must lose
    Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
    The benediction of these covering heavens
    Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
    To inlay heaven with stars.

CYMBELINE

    Thou weep'st, and speak'st.
    The service that you three have done is more
    Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:
    If these be they, I know not how to wish
    A pair of worthier sons.

BELARIUS

    Be pleased awhile.
    This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
    Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:
    This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
    Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
    In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
    Of his queen mother, which for more probation
    I can with ease produce.

CYMBELINE

    Guiderius had
    Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
    It was a mark of wonder.

BELARIUS

    This is he;
    Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:
    It was wise nature's end in the donation,
    To be his evidence now.

CYMBELINE

    O, what, am I
    A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
    Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
    That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
    may reign in them now! O Imogen,
    Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.

IMOGEN

    No, my lord;
    I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,
    Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
    But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,
    When I was but your sister; I you brothers,
    When ye were so indeed.

CYMBELINE

    Did you e'er meet?

ARVIRAGUS

    Ay, my good lord.

GUIDERIUS

    And at first meeting loved;
    Continued so, until we thought he died.

CORNELIUS

    By the queen's dram she swallow'd.

CYMBELINE

    O rare instinct!
    When shall I hear all through? This fierce
    abridgement
    Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
    Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?
    And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
    How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
    Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
    And your three motives to the battle, with
    I know not how much more, should be demanded;
    And all the other by-dependencies,
    From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place
    Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,
    Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,
    And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
    On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting
    Each object with a joy: the counterchange
    Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
    And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.

    To BELARIUS
    Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.

IMOGEN

    You are my father too, and did relieve me,
    To see this gracious season.

CYMBELINE

    All o'erjoy'd,
    Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,
    For they shall taste our comfort.

IMOGEN

    My good master,
    I will yet do you service.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Happy be you!

CYMBELINE

    The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
    He would have well becomed this place, and graced
    The thankings of a king.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    I am, sir,
    The soldier that did company these three
    In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
    The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,
    Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might
    Have made you finish.

IACHIMO

    [Kneeling] I am down again:
    But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
    As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
    Which I so often owe: but your ring first;
    And here the bracelet of the truest princess
    That ever swore her faith.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Kneel not to me:
    The power that I have on you is, to spare you;
    The malice towards you to forgive you: live,
    And deal with others better.

CYMBELINE

    Nobly doom'd!
    We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;
    Pardon's the word to all.

ARVIRAGUS

    You holp us, sir,
    As you did mean indeed to be our brother;
    Joy'd are we that you are.

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS

    Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,
    Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought
    Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,
    Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows
    Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
    This label on my bosom; whose containing
    Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
    Make no collection of it: let him show
    His skill in the construction.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Philarmonus!

Soothsayer

    Here, my good lord.

CAIUS LUCIUS

    Read, and declare the meaning.

Soothsayer

    [Reads] 'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself
    unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a
    piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar
    shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many
    years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
    stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end
    his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in
    peace and plenty.'
    Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;
    The fit and apt construction of thy name,
    Being Leonatus, doth import so much.

    To CYMBELINE
    The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
    Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'
    We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine
    Is this most constant wife; who, even now,
    Answering the letter of the oracle,
    Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
    With this most tender air.

CYMBELINE

    This hath some seeming.

Soothsayer

    The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
    Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point
    Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,
    For many years thought dead, are now revived,
    To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue
    Promises Britain peace and plenty.

CYMBELINE

    Well
    My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
    Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,
    And to the Roman empire; promising
    To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
    We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;
    Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,
    Have laid most heavy hand.

Soothsayer

    The fingers of the powers above do tune
    The harmony of this peace. The vision
    Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke
    Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant
    Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,
    From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
    Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun
    So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,
    The imperial Caesar, should again unite
    His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
    Which shines here in the west.

CYMBELINE

    Laud we the gods;
    And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
    From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
    To all our subjects. Set we forward: let
    A Roman and a British ensign wave
    Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:
    And in the temple of great Jupiter
    Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
    Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
    Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.

Loves Labours Lost

ACT I
SCENE I. The king of Navarre's park.

    Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE and DUMAIN

FERDINAND

    Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
    Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
    And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
    When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
    The endeavor of this present breath may buy
    That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
    And make us heirs of all eternity.
    Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
    That war against your own affections
    And the huge army of the world's desires,--
    Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
    Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
    Our court shall be a little Academe,
    Still and contemplative in living art.
    You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
    Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
    My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
    That are recorded in this schedule here:
    Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
    That his own hand may strike his honour down
    That violates the smallest branch herein:
    If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
    Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.

LONGAVILLE

    I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
    The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
    Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
    Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.

DUMAIN

    My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
    The grosser manner of these world's delights
    He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
    To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
    With all these living in philosophy.

BIRON

    I can but say their protestation over;
    So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
    That is, to live and study here three years.
    But there are other strict observances;
    As, not to see a woman in that term,
    Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
    And one day in a week to touch no food
    And but one meal on every day beside,
    The which I hope is not enrolled there;
    And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
    And not be seen to wink of all the day--
    When I was wont to think no harm all night
    And make a dark night too of half the day--
    Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
    O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
    Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!

FERDINAND

    Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.

BIRON

    Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
    I only swore to study with your grace
    And stay here in your court for three years' space.

LONGAVILLE

    You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.

BIRON

    By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
    What is the end of study? let me know.

FERDINAND

    Why, that to know, which else we should not know.

BIRON

    Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?

FERDINAND

    Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.

BIRON

    Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
    To know the thing I am forbid to know:
    As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
    When I to feast expressly am forbid;
    Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
    When mistresses from common sense are hid;
    Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
    Study to break it and not break my troth.
    If study's gain be thus and this be so,
    Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
    Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.

FERDINAND

    These be the stops that hinder study quite
    And train our intellects to vain delight.

BIRON

    Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
    Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
    As, painfully to pore upon a book
    To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
    Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
    Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
    So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
    Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
    Study me how to please the eye indeed
    By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
    Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
    And give him light that it was blinded by.
    Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
    That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
    Small have continual plodders ever won
    Save base authority from others' books
    These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
    That give a name to every fixed star
    Have no more profit of their shining nights
    Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
    Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
    And every godfather can give a name.

FERDINAND

    How well he's read, to reason against reading!

DUMAIN

    Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!

LONGAVILLE

    He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.

BIRON

    The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.

DUMAIN

    How follows that?

BIRON

    Fit in his place and time.

DUMAIN

    In reason nothing.

BIRON

    Something then in rhyme.

FERDINAND

    Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
    That bites the first-born infants of the spring.

BIRON

    Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
    Before the birds have any cause to sing?
    Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
    At Christmas I no more desire a rose
    Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
    But like of each thing that in season grows.
    So you, to study now it is too late,
    Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.

FERDINAND

    Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.

BIRON

    No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
    And though I have for barbarism spoke more
    Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
    Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
    And bide the penance of each three years' day.
    Give me the paper; let me read the same;
    And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.

FERDINAND

    How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!

BIRON

    [Reads] 'Item, That no woman shall come within a
    mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?

LONGAVILLE

    Four days ago.

BIRON

    Let's see the penalty.

    Reads
    'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?

LONGAVILLE

    Marry, that did I.

BIRON

    Sweet lord, and why?

LONGAVILLE

    To fright them hence with that dread penalty.

BIRON

    A dangerous law against gentility!

    Reads
    'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
    within the term of three years, he shall endure such
    public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
    This article, my liege, yourself must break;
    For well you know here comes in embassy
    The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
    A maid of grace and complete majesty--
    About surrender up of Aquitaine
    To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
    Therefore this article is made in vain,
    Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.

FERDINAND

    What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.

BIRON

    So study evermore is overshot:
    While it doth study to have what it would
    It doth forget to do the thing it should,
    And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
    'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.

FERDINAND

    We must of force dispense with this decree;
    She must lie here on mere necessity.

BIRON

    Necessity will make us all forsworn
    Three thousand times within this three years' space;
    For every man with his affects is born,
    Not by might master'd but by special grace:
    If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
    I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
    So to the laws at large I write my name:

    Subscribes
    And he that breaks them in the least degree
    Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
    Suggestions are to other as to me;
    But I believe, although I seem so loath,
    I am the last that will last keep his oath.
    But is there no quick recreation granted?

FERDINAND

    Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
    With a refined traveller of Spain;
    A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
    That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
    One whom the music of his own vain tongue
    Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
    A man of complements, whom right and wrong
    Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
    This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
    For interim to our studies shall relate
    In high-born words the worth of many a knight
    From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
    How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
    But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
    And I will use him for my minstrelsy.

BIRON

    Armado is a most illustrious wight,
    A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.

LONGAVILLE

    Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
    And so to study, three years is but short.

    Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD

DULL

    Which is the duke's own person?

BIRON

    This, fellow: what wouldst?

DULL

    I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
    grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
    in flesh and blood.

BIRON

    This is he.

DULL

    Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
    abroad: this letter will tell you more.

COSTARD

    Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.

FERDINAND

    A letter from the magnificent Armado.

BIRON

    How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.

LONGAVILLE

    A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!

BIRON

    To hear? or forbear laughing?

LONGAVILLE

    To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
    forbear both.

BIRON

    Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
    climb in the merriness.

COSTARD

    The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
    The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.

BIRON

    In what manner?

COSTARD

    In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
    I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
    her upon the form, and taken following her into the
    park; which, put together, is in manner and form
    following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
    manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
    in some form.

BIRON

    For the following, sir?

COSTARD

    As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
    the right!

FERDINAND

    Will you hear this letter with attention?

BIRON

    As we would hear an oracle.

COSTARD

    Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
    sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
    and body's fostering patron.'

COSTARD

    Not a word of Costard yet.

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'So it is,'--

COSTARD

    It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
    telling true, but so.

FERDINAND

    Peace!

COSTARD

    Be to me and every man that dares not fight!

FERDINAND

    No words!

COSTARD

    Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
    melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
    to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
    air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
    walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
    beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
    to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
    for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
    I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
    for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
    that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
    from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
    here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
    but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
    and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
    knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
    swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--

COSTARD

    Me?

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--

COSTARD

    Me?

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'that shallow vassal,'--

COSTARD

    Still me?

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--

COSTARD

    O, me!

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
    established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
    which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
    wherewith,--

COSTARD

    With a wench.

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
    female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
    woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
    have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
    punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
    Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
    estimation.'

DULL

    'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.

FERDINAND

    [Reads] 'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
    called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
    swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;
    and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
    her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
    and heart-burning heat of duty.
    DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'

BIRON

    This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
    that ever I heard.

FERDINAND

    Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
    you to this?

COSTARD

    Sir, I confess the wench.

FERDINAND

    Did you hear the proclamation?

COSTARD

    I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
    the marking of it.

FERDINAND

    It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
    with a wench.

COSTARD

    I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.

FERDINAND

    Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'

COSTARD

    This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.

FERDINAND

    It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'

COSTARD

    If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.

FERDINAND

    This maid will not serve your turn, sir.

COSTARD

    This maid will serve my turn, sir.

FERDINAND

    Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
    a week with bran and water.

COSTARD

    I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.

FERDINAND

    And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
    My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
    And go we, lords, to put in practise that
    Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.

    Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN

BIRON

    I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
    These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
    Sirrah, come on.

COSTARD

    I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
    taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
    girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
    prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
    till then, sit thee down, sorrow!

    Exeunt
    LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH

    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
    grows melancholy?

MOTH

    A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.

MOTH

    No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
    tender juvenal?

MOTH

    By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Why tough senior? why tough senior?

MOTH

    Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
    appertaining to thy young days, which we may
    nominate tender.

MOTH

    And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
    old time, which we may name tough.
    DON ADRIANO DE

ARMADO

    Pretty and apt.

MOTH

    How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
    I apt, and my saying pretty?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Thou pretty, because little.

MOTH

    Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    And therefore apt, because quick.

MOTH

    Speak you this in my praise, master?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    In thy condign praise.

MOTH

    I will praise an eel with the same praise.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    What, that an eel is ingenious?

MOTH

    That an eel is quick.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.

MOTH

    I am answered, sir.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I love not to be crossed.

MOTH

    [Aside] He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I have promised to study three years with the duke.

MOTH

    You may do it in an hour, sir.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Impossible.

MOTH

    How many is one thrice told?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.

MOTH

    You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
    complete man.

MOTH

    Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
    deuce-ace amounts to.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    It doth amount to one more than two.

MOTH

    Which the base vulgar do call three.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    True.

MOTH

    Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
    is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
    easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
    study three years in two words, the dancing horse
    will tell you.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    A most fine figure!

MOTH

    To prove you a cipher.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
    base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
    base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
    of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
    thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
    ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
    courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
    outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
    have been in love?

MOTH

    Hercules, master.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
    more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
    repute and carriage.

MOTH

    Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
    carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
    like a porter: and he was in love.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
    excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
    carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
    love, my dear Moth?

MOTH

    A woman, master.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Of what complexion?

MOTH

    Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Tell me precisely of what complexion.

MOTH

    Of the sea-water green, sir.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Is that one of the four complexions?

MOTH

    As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
    love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
    for it. He surely affected her for her wit.

MOTH

    It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    My love is most immaculate white and red.

MOTH

    Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
    such colours.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Define, define, well-educated infant.

MOTH

    My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
    pathetical!

MOTH

    If she be made of white and red,
    Her faults will ne'er be known,
    For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
    And fears by pale white shown:
    Then if she fear, or be to blame,
    By this you shall not know,
    For still her cheeks possess the same
    Which native she doth owe.
    A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
    white and red.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?

MOTH

    The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
    three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
    found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
    the writing nor the tune.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
    example my digression by some mighty precedent.
    Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
    park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.

MOTH

    [Aside] To be whipped; and yet a better love than
    my master.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.

MOTH

    And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I say, sing.

MOTH

    Forbear till this company be past.

    Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA

DULL

    Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
    safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
    nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
    For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
    is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!

JAQUENETTA

    Man?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I will visit thee at the lodge.

JAQUENETTA

    That's hereby.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I know where it is situate.

JAQUENETTA

    Lord, how wise you are!
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I will tell thee wonders.

JAQUENETTA

    With that face?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I love thee.

JAQUENETTA

    So I heard you say.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    And so, farewell.

JAQUENETTA

    Fair weather after you!

DULL

    Come, Jaquenetta, away!

    Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
    be pardoned.

COSTARD

    Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
    full stomach.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Thou shalt be heavily punished.

COSTARD

    I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
    are but lightly rewarded.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Take away this villain; shut him up.

MOTH

    Come, you transgressing slave; away!

COSTARD

    Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.

MOTH

    No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.

COSTARD

    Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
    that I have seen, some shall see.

MOTH

    What shall some see?

COSTARD

    Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
    It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
    words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
    God I have as little patience as another man; and
    therefore I can be quiet.

    Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I do affect the very ground, which is base, where
    her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
    is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
    is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
    how can that be true love which is falsely
    attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
    there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
    tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
    Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
    Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
    and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
    The first and second cause will not serve my turn;
    the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
    not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his
    glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
    be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,
    he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
    for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;
    write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.

    Exit
    LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

ACT II
SCENE I. The same.

    Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA, KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants

BOYET

    Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
    Consider who the king your father sends,
    To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
    Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
    To parley with the sole inheritor
    Of all perfections that a man may owe,
    Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
    Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
    Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
    As Nature was in making graces dear
    When she did starve the general world beside
    And prodigally gave them all to you.

PRINCESS

    Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
    Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
    Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
    Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
    I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
    Than you much willing to be counted wise
    In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
    But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
    You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
    Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
    Till painful study shall outwear three years,
    No woman may approach his silent court:
    Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
    Before we enter his forbidden gates,
    To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
    Bold of your worthiness, we single you
    As our best-moving fair solicitor.
    Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
    On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
    Importunes personal conference with his grace:
    Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
    Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.

BOYET

    Proud of employment, willingly I go.

PRINCESS

    All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.

    Exit BOYET
    Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
    That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?

First Lord

    Lord Longaville is one.

PRINCESS

    Know you the man?

MARIA

    I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
    Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
    Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
    In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
    A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
    Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
    Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
    The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
    If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
    Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
    Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
    It should none spare that come within his power.

PRINCESS

    Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?

MARIA

    They say so most that most his humours know.

PRINCESS

    Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
    Who are the rest?

KATHARINE

    The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
    Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
    Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
    For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
    And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
    I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
    And much too little of that good I saw
    Is my report to his great worthiness.

ROSALINE

    Another of these students at that time
    Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
    Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
    Within the limit of becoming mirth,
    I never spent an hour's talk withal:
    His eye begets occasion for his wit;
    For every object that the one doth catch
    The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
    Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
    Delivers in such apt and gracious words
    That aged ears play truant at his tales
    And younger hearings are quite ravished;
    So sweet and voluble is his discourse.

PRINCESS

    God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
    That every one her own hath garnished
    With such bedecking ornaments of praise?

First Lord

    Here comes Boyet.

    Re-enter BOYET

PRINCESS

    Now, what admittance, lord?

BOYET

    Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
    And he and his competitors in oath
    Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
    Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
    He rather means to lodge you in the field,
    Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
    Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
    To let you enter his unpeopled house.
    Here comes Navarre.

    Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and Attendants

FERDINAND

    Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.

PRINCESS

    'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
    not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
    yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.

FERDINAND

    You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.

PRINCESS

    I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.

FERDINAND

    Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.

PRINCESS

    Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.

FERDINAND

    Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.

PRINCESS

    Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.

FERDINAND

    Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.

PRINCESS

    Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
    Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
    I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
    Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
    And sin to break it.
    But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
    To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
    Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
    And suddenly resolve me in my suit.

FERDINAND

    Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.

PRINCESS

    You will the sooner, that I were away;
    For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.

BIRON

    Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

ROSALINE

    Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?

BIRON

    I know you did.

ROSALINE

    How needless was it then to ask the question!

BIRON

    You must not be so quick.

ROSALINE

    'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.

BIRON

    Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.

ROSALINE

    Not till it leave the rider in the mire.

BIRON

    What time o' day?

ROSALINE

    The hour that fools should ask.

BIRON

    Now fair befall your mask!

ROSALINE

    Fair fall the face it covers!

BIRON

    And send you many lovers!

ROSALINE

    Amen, so you be none.

BIRON

    Nay, then will I be gone.

FERDINAND

    Madam, your father here doth intimate
    The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
    Being but the one half of an entire sum
    Disbursed by my father in his wars.
    But say that he or we, as neither have,
    Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
    A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
    One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
    Although not valued to the money's worth.
    If then the king your father will restore
    But that one half which is unsatisfied,
    We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
    And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
    But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
    For here he doth demand to have repaid
    A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
    On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
    To have his title live in Aquitaine;
    Which we much rather had depart withal
    And have the money by our father lent
    Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
    Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
    From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
    A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
    And go well satisfied to France again.

PRINCESS

    You do the king my father too much wrong
    And wrong the reputation of your name,
    In so unseeming to confess receipt
    Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.

FERDINAND

    I do protest I never heard of it;
    And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
    Or yield up Aquitaine.

PRINCESS

    We arrest your word.
    Boyet, you can produce acquittances
    For such a sum from special officers
    Of Charles his father.

FERDINAND

    Satisfy me so.

BOYET

    So please your grace, the packet is not come
    Where that and other specialties are bound:
    To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.

FERDINAND

    It shall suffice me: at which interview
    All liberal reason I will yield unto.
    Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
    As honour without breach of honour may
    Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
    You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
    But here without you shall be so received
    As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
    Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
    Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
    To-morrow shall we visit you again.

PRINCESS

    Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!

FERDINAND

    Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!

    Exit

BIRON

    Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.

ROSALINE

    Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.

BIRON

    I would you heard it groan.

ROSALINE

    Is the fool sick?

BIRON

    Sick at the heart.

ROSALINE

    Alack, let it blood.

BIRON

    Would that do it good?

ROSALINE

    My physic says 'ay.'

BIRON

    Will you prick't with your eye?

ROSALINE

    No point, with my knife.

BIRON

    Now, God save thy life!

ROSALINE

    And yours from long living!

BIRON

    I cannot stay thanksgiving.

    Retiring

DUMAIN

    Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?

BOYET

    The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.

DUMAIN

    A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.

    Exit

LONGAVILLE

    I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?

BOYET

    A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.

LONGAVILLE

    Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.

BOYET

    She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.

LONGAVILLE

    Pray you, sir, whose daughter?

BOYET

    Her mother's, I have heard.

LONGAVILLE

    God's blessing on your beard!

BOYET

    Good sir, be not offended.
    She is an heir of Falconbridge.

LONGAVILLE

    Nay, my choler is ended.
    She is a most sweet lady.

BOYET

    Not unlike, sir, that may be.

    Exit LONGAVILLE

BIRON

    What's her name in the cap?

BOYET

    Rosaline, by good hap.

BIRON

    Is she wedded or no?

BOYET

    To her will, sir, or so.

BIRON

    You are welcome, sir: adieu.

BOYET

    Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.

    Exit BIRON

MARIA

    That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
    Not a word with him but a jest.

BOYET

    And every jest but a word.

PRINCESS

    It was well done of you to take him at his word.

BOYET

    I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.

MARIA

    Two hot sheeps, marry.

BOYET

    And wherefore not ships?
    No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.

MARIA

    You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?

BOYET

    So you grant pasture for me.

    Offering to kiss her

MARIA

    Not so, gentle beast:
    My lips are no common, though several they be.

BOYET

    Belonging to whom?

MARIA

    To my fortunes and me.

PRINCESS

    Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
    This civil war of wits were much better used
    On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.

BOYET

    If my observation, which very seldom lies,
    By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
    Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.

PRINCESS

    With what?

BOYET

    With that which we lovers entitle affected.

PRINCESS

    Your reason?

BOYET

    Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
    To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
    His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
    Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
    His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
    Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
    All senses to that sense did make their repair,
    To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
    Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
    As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
    Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
    Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
    His face's own margent did quote such amazes
    That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
    I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
    An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.

PRINCESS

    Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.

BOYET

    But to speak that in words which his eye hath
    disclosed.
    I only have made a mouth of his eye,
    By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.

ROSALINE

    Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.

MARIA

    He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.

ROSALINE

    Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.

BOYET

    Do you hear, my mad wenches?

MARIA

    No.

BOYET

    What then, do you see?

ROSALINE

    Ay, our way to be gone.

BOYET

    You are too hard for me.

SCENE I. The same.

    Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH

    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.

MOTH

    Concolinel.

    Singing
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
    give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
    hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.

MOTH

    Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    How meanest thou? brawling in French?

MOTH

    No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
    the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
    it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
    sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
    swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
    the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
    love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
    your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
    doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
    your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
    keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
    These are complements, these are humours; these
    betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
    these; and make them men of note--do you note
    me?--that most are affected to these.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    How hast thou purchased this experience?

MOTH

    By my penny of observation.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    But O,--but O,--

MOTH

    'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?

MOTH

    No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
    love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Almost I had.

MOTH

    Negligent student! learn her by heart.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    By heart and in heart, boy.

MOTH

    And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    What wilt thou prove?

MOTH

    A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
    the instant: by heart you love her, because your
    heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
    because your heart is in love with her; and out of
    heart you love her, being out of heart that you
    cannot enjoy her.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I am all these three.

MOTH

    And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
    all.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.

MOTH

    A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
    for an ass.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Ha, ha! what sayest thou?

MOTH

    Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
    for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The way is but short: away!

MOTH

    As swift as lead, sir.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The meaning, pretty ingenious?
    Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?

MOTH

    Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I say lead is slow.

MOTH

    You are too swift, sir, to say so:
    Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
    He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
    I shoot thee at the swain.

MOTH

    Thump then and I flee.

    Exit
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
    By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
    Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
    My herald is return'd.

    Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD

MOTH

    A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.

COSTARD

    No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
    mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
    l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
    thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
    me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
    Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
    the word l'envoy for a salve?

MOTH

    Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
    Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
    I will example it:
    The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
    Were still at odds, being but three.
    There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.

MOTH

    I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
    Were still at odds, being but three.

MOTH

    Until the goose came out of door,
    And stay'd the odds by adding four.
    Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
    my l'envoy.
    The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
    Were still at odds, being but three.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Until the goose came out of door,
    Staying the odds by adding four.

MOTH

    A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
    desire more?

COSTARD

    The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
    Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
    To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
    Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?

MOTH

    By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
    Then call'd you for the l'envoy.

COSTARD

    True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
    argument in;
    Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
    And he ended the market.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?

MOTH

    I will tell you sensibly.

COSTARD

    Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
    I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
    Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    We will talk no more of this matter.

COSTARD

    Till there be more matter in the shin.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.

COSTARD

    O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
    some goose, in this.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
    enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
    restrained, captivated, bound.

COSTARD

    True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
    in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
    bear this significant

    Giving a letter
    to the country maid Jaquenetta:
    there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
    honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.

    Exit

MOTH

    Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.

COSTARD

    My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!

    Exit MOTH
    Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
    O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
    farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
    inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
    remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
    why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
    never buy and sell out of this word.

    Enter BIRON

BIRON

    O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.

COSTARD

    Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
    buy for a remuneration?

BIRON

    What is a remuneration?

COSTARD

    Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.

BIRON

    Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.

COSTARD

    I thank your worship: God be wi' you!

BIRON

    Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
    As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
    Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.

COSTARD

    When would you have it done, sir?

BIRON

    This afternoon.

COSTARD

    Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.

BIRON

    Thou knowest not what it is.

COSTARD

    I shall know, sir, when I have done it.

BIRON

    Why, villain, thou must know first.

COSTARD

    I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.

BIRON

    It must be done this afternoon.
    Hark, slave, it is but this:
    The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
    And in her train there is a gentle lady;
    When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
    And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
    And to her white hand see thou do commend
    This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.

    Giving him a shilling

COSTARD

    Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
    a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
    will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!

    Exit

BIRON

    And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;
    A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
    A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
    A domineering pedant o'er the boy;
    Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
    This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
    This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
    Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
    The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
    Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
    Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
    Sole imperator and great general
    Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
    And I to be a corporal of his field,
    And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
    What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
    A woman, that is like a German clock,
    Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
    And never going aright, being a watch,
    But being watch'd that it may still go right!
    Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
    And, among three, to love the worst of all;
    A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
    With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
    Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
    Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
    And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
    To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
    That Cupid will impose for my neglect
    Of his almighty dreadful little might.
    Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
    Some men must love my lady and some Joan.

    Exit
    LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

ACT IV
SCENE I. The same.

    Enter the PRINCESS, and her train, a Forester, BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE

PRINCESS

    Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard
    Against the steep uprising of the hill?

BOYET

    I know not; but I think it was not he.

PRINCESS

    Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
    Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
    On Saturday we will return to France.
    Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
    That we must stand and play the murderer in?

Forester

    Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
    A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.

PRINCESS

    I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
    And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.

Forester

    Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.

PRINCESS

    What, what? first praise me and again say no?
    O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!

Forester

    Yes, madam, fair.

PRINCESS

    Nay, never paint me now:
    Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
    Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
    Fair payment for foul words is more than due.

Forester

    Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.

PRINCESS

    See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
    O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
    A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
    But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
    And shooting well is then accounted ill.
    Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
    Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
    If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
    That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
    And out of question so it is sometimes,
    Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
    When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
    We bend to that the working of the heart;
    As I for praise alone now seek to spill
    The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.

BOYET

    Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
    Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
    Lords o'er their lords?

PRINCESS

    Only for praise: and praise we may afford
    To any lady that subdues a lord.

BOYET

    Here comes a member of the commonwealth.

    Enter COSTARD

COSTARD

    God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?

PRINCESS

    Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.

COSTARD

    Which is the greatest lady, the highest?

PRINCESS

    The thickest and the tallest.

COSTARD

    The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
    An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
    One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
    Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.

PRINCESS

    What's your will, sir? what's your will?

COSTARD

    I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.

PRINCESS

    O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
    Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;
    Break up this capon.

BOYET

    I am bound to serve.
    This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
    It is writ to Jaquenetta.

PRINCESS

    We will read it, I swear.
    Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.

    Reads

BOYET

    'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
    true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
    thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
    than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
    commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
    magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
    eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
    Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
    Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
    vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
    came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
    overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
    come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
    whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
    beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
    conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
    The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
    beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
    side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
    both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
    thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
    Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
    thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
    will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
    for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
    expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
    my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
    part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
    DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
    Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
    'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
    Submissive fall his princely feet before,
    And he from forage will incline to play:
    But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
    Food for his rage, repasture for his den.

PRINCESS

    What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
    What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?

BOYET

    I am much deceived but I remember the style.

PRINCESS

    Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.

BOYET

    This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
    A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
    To the prince and his bookmates.

PRINCESS

    Thou fellow, a word:
    Who gave thee this letter?

COSTARD

    I told you; my lord.

PRINCESS

    To whom shouldst thou give it?

COSTARD

    From my lord to my lady.

PRINCESS

    From which lord to which lady?

COSTARD

    From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
    To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.

PRINCESS

    Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.

    To ROSALINE
    Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.

    Exeunt PRINCESS and train

BOYET

    Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?

ROSALINE

    Shall I teach you to know?

BOYET

    Ay, my continent of beauty.

ROSALINE

    Why, she that bears the bow.
    Finely put off!

BOYET

    My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
    Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
    Finely put on!

ROSALINE

    Well, then, I am the shooter.

BOYET

    And who is your deer?

ROSALINE

    If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
    Finely put on, indeed!

MARIA

    You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
    at the brow.

BOYET

    But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?

ROSALINE

    Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was
    a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as
    touching the hit it?

BOYET

    So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a
    woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little
    wench, as touching the hit it.

ROSALINE

    Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
    Thou canst not hit it, my good man.

BOYET

    An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
    An I cannot, another can.

    Exeunt ROSALINE and KATHARINE

COSTARD

    By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!

MARIA

    A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.

BOYET

    A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
    Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.

MARIA

    Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.

COSTARD

    Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.

BOYET

    An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.

COSTARD

    Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.

MARIA

    Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.

COSTARD

    She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.

BOYET

    I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.

    Exeunt BOYET and MARIA

COSTARD

    By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
    Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
    O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony
    vulgar wit!
    When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
    were, so fit.
    Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
    To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
    To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'
    will swear!
    And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!
    Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
    Sola, sola!

    LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL

SIR NATHANIEL

    Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony
    of a good conscience.

HOLOFERNES

    The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
    as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in
    the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
    and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,
    the soil, the land, the earth.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
    varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
    assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.

HOLOFERNES

    Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.

DULL

    'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.

HOLOFERNES

    Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
    insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
    explication; facere, as it were, replication, or
    rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
    inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
    uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
    unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
    insert again my haud credo for a deer.

DULL

    I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.

HOLOFERNES

    Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
    O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!

SIR NATHANIEL

    Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
    in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he
    hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
    replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in
    the duller parts:
    And such barren plants are set before us, that we
    thankful should be,
    Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
    do fructify in us more than he.
    For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
    So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
    But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,
    Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.

DULL

    You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
    What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
    weeks old as yet?

HOLOFERNES

    Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.

DULL

    What is Dictynna?

SIR NATHANIEL

    A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.

HOLOFERNES

    The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
    And raught not to five weeks when he came to
    five-score.
    The allusion holds in the exchange.

DULL

    'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.

HOLOFERNES

    God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds
    in the exchange.

DULL

    And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for
    the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
    that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.

HOLOFERNES

    Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
    on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
    ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall
    please you to abrogate scurrility.

HOLOFERNES

    I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
    The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
    pleasing pricket;
    Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made
    sore with shooting.
    The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
    from thicket;
    Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
    If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
    one sorel.
    Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.

SIR NATHANIEL

    A rare talent!

DULL

    [Aside] If a talent be a claw, look how he claws
    him with a talent.

HOLOFERNES

    This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a
    foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
    shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
    revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
    memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and
    delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the
    gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
    thankful for it.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my
    parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by
    you, and their daughters profit very greatly under
    you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.

HOLOFERNES

    Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
    want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,
    I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca
    loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.

    Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD

JAQUENETTA

    God give you good morrow, master Parson.

HOLOFERNES

    Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be
    pierced, which is the one?

COSTARD

    Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.

HOLOFERNES

    Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
    tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough
    for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.

JAQUENETTA

    Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
    letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
    from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.

HOLOFERNES

    Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
    Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I
    may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;
    Venetia, Venetia,
    Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.
    Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee
    not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
    Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,
    as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?

SIR NATHANIEL

    Ay, sir, and very learned.

HOLOFERNES

    Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.

SIR NATHANIEL

    [Reads]
    If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
    Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!
    Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:
    Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like
    osiers bow'd.
    Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,
    Where all those pleasures live that art would
    comprehend:
    If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
    Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,
    All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
    Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:
    Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
    Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
    Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,
    That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.

HOLOFERNES

    You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the
    accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are
    only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,
    facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.
    Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,
    but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
    fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:
    so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,
    the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
    was this directed to you?

JAQUENETTA

    Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
    queen's lords.

HOLOFERNES

    I will overglance the superscript: 'To the
    snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady
    Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of
    the letter, for the nomination of the party writing
    to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all
    desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this
    Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here
    he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
    queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of
    progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my
    sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
    king: it may concern much. Stay not thy
    compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.

JAQUENETTA

    Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!

COSTARD

    Have with thee, my girl.

    Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA

SIR NATHANIEL

    Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very
    religiously; and, as a certain father saith,--

HOLOFERNES

    Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable
    colours. But to return to the verses: did they
    please you, Sir Nathaniel?

SIR NATHANIEL

    Marvellous well for the pen.

HOLOFERNES

    I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil
    of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please
    you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my
    privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid
    child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I
    will prove those verses to be very unlearned,
    neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I
    beseech your society.

SIR NATHANIEL

    And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is
    the happiness of life.

HOLOFERNES

    And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.

    To DULL
    Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not
    say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at
    their game, and we will to our recreation.

    LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

SCENE III. The same.

    Enter BIRON, with a paper

BIRON

    The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing
    myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in
    a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul
    word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say
    the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well
    proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as
    Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:
    well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if
    I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her
    eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not
    love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
    in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
    heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
    and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,
    and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my
    sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
    it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
    fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care
    a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one
    with a paper: God give him grace to groan!

    Stands aside

    Enter FERDINAND, with a paper

FERDINAND

    Ay me!

BIRON

    [Aside] Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid:
    thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the
    left pap. In faith, secrets!

FERDINAND

    [Reads]
    So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
    To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
    As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
    The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:
    Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
    Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
    As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;
    Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:
    No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
    So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
    Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
    And they thy glory through my grief will show:
    But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
    My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
    O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
    No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
    How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:
    Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?

    Steps aside
    What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.

BIRON

    Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!

    Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper

LONGAVILLE

    Ay me, I am forsworn!

BIRON

    Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.

FERDINAND

    In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!

BIRON

    One drunkard loves another of the name.

LONGAVILLE

    Am I the first that have been perjured so?

BIRON

    I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
    Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
    The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.

LONGAVILLE

    I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:
    O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
    These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.

BIRON

    O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
    Disfigure not his slop.

LONGAVILLE

    This same shall go.

    Reads
    Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
    'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
    Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
    Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
    A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
    Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
    My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
    Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
    Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
    Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,
    Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:
    If broken then, it is no fault of mine:
    If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
    To lose an oath to win a paradise?

BIRON

    This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
    A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
    God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.

LONGAVILLE

    By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.

    Steps aside

BIRON

    All hid, all hid; an old infant play.
    Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.
    And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.
    More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!

    Enter DUMAIN, with a paper
    Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!

DUMAIN

    O most divine Kate!

BIRON

    O most profane coxcomb!

DUMAIN

    By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!

BIRON

    By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.

DUMAIN

    Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.

BIRON

    An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.

DUMAIN

    As upright as the cedar.

BIRON

    Stoop, I say;
    Her shoulder is with child.

DUMAIN

    As fair as day.

BIRON

    Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.

DUMAIN

    O that I had my wish!

LONGAVILLE

    And I had mine!

FERDINAND

    And I mine too, good Lord!

BIRON

    Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?

DUMAIN

    I would forget her; but a fever she
    Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.

BIRON

    A fever in your blood! why, then incision
    Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!

DUMAIN

    Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.

BIRON

    Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.

DUMAIN

    [Reads]
    On a day--alack the day!--
    Love, whose month is ever May,
    Spied a blossom passing fair
    Playing in the wanton air:
    Through the velvet leaves the wind,
    All unseen, can passage find;
    That the lover, sick to death,
    Wish himself the heaven's breath.
    Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
    Air, would I might triumph so!
    But, alack, my hand is sworn
    Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
    Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
    Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
    Do not call it sin in me,
    That I am forsworn for thee;
    Thou for whom Jove would swear
    Juno but an Ethiope were;
    And deny himself for Jove,
    Turning mortal for thy love.
    This will I send, and something else more plain,
    That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
    O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
    Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
    Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
    For none offend where all alike do dote.

LONGAVILLE

    [Advancing] Dumain, thy love is far from charity.
    You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
    To be o'erheard and taken napping so.

FERDINAND

    [Advancing] Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
    You chide at him, offending twice as much;
    You do not love Maria; Longaville
    Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
    Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
    His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
    I have been closely shrouded in this bush
    And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:
    I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
    Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
    Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
    One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:

    To LONGAVILLE
    You would for paradise break faith, and troth;

    To DUMAIN
    And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
    What will Biron say when that he shall hear
    Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
    How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
    How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
    For all the wealth that ever I did see,
    I would not have him know so much by me.

BIRON

    Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.

    Advancing
    Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
    Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
    These worms for loving, that art most in love?
    Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
    There is no certain princess that appears;
    You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
    Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
    But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
    All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
    You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
    But I a beam do find in each of three.
    O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
    Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
    O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
    To see a king transformed to a gnat!
    To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
    And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
    And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
    And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
    Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
    And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
    And where my liege's? all about the breast:
    A caudle, ho!

FERDINAND

    Too bitter is thy jest.
    Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?

BIRON

    Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
    I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
    To break the vow I am engaged in;
    I am betray'd, by keeping company
    With men like men of inconstancy.
    When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
    Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
    In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
    Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
    A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
    A leg, a limb?

FERDINAND

    Soft! whither away so fast?
    A true man or a thief that gallops so?

BIRON

    I post from love: good lover, let me go.

    Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD

JAQUENETTA

    God bless the king!

FERDINAND

    What present hast thou there?

COSTARD

    Some certain treason.

FERDINAND

    What makes treason here?

COSTARD

    Nay, it makes nothing, sir.

FERDINAND

    If it mar nothing neither,
    The treason and you go in peace away together.

JAQUENETTA

    I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
    Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.

FERDINAND

    Biron, read it over.

    Giving him the paper
    Where hadst thou it?

JAQUENETTA

    Of Costard.

FERDINAND

    Where hadst thou it?

COSTARD

    Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.

    BIRON tears the letter

FERDINAND

    How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?

BIRON

    A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.

LONGAVILLE

    It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.

DUMAIN

    It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.

    Gathering up the pieces

BIRON

    [To COSTARD] Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were
    born to do me shame.
    Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.

FERDINAND

    What?

BIRON

    That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
    He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
    Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
    O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.

DUMAIN

    Now the number is even.

BIRON

    True, true; we are four.
    Will these turtles be gone?

FERDINAND

    Hence, sirs; away!

COSTARD

    Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.

    Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA

BIRON

    Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
    As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
    The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
    Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
    We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
    Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.

FERDINAND

    What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?

BIRON

    Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
    That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
    At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
    Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
    Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
    What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
    Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
    That is not blinded by her majesty?

FERDINAND

    What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
    My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
    She an attending star, scarce seen a light.

BIRON

    My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
    O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
    Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
    Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
    Where several worthies make one dignity,
    Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
    Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
    Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
    To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
    She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
    A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
    Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
    Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
    And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
    O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.

FERDINAND

    By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.

BIRON

    Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
    A wife of such wood were felicity.
    O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
    That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
    If that she learn not of her eye to look:
    No face is fair that is not full so black.

FERDINAND

    O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
    The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
    And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.

BIRON

    Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
    O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
    It mourns that painting and usurping hair
    Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
    And therefore is she born to make black fair.
    Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
    For native blood is counted painting now;
    And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
    Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.

DUMAIN

    To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.

LONGAVILLE

    And since her time are colliers counted bright.

FERDINAND

    And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.

DUMAIN

    Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.

BIRON

    Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
    For fear their colours should be wash'd away.

FERDINAND

    'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
    I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.

BIRON

    I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.

FERDINAND

    No devil will fright thee then so much as she.

DUMAIN

    I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.

LONGAVILLE

    Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.

BIRON

    O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
    Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!

DUMAIN

    O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
    The street should see as she walk'd overhead.

FERDINAND

    But what of this? are we not all in love?

BIRON

    Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.

FERDINAND

    Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
    Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.

DUMAIN

    Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.

LONGAVILLE

    O, some authority how to proceed;
    Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.

DUMAIN

    Some salve for perjury.

BIRON

    'Tis more than need.
    Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
    Consider what you first did swear unto,
    To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
    Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
    Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
    And abstinence engenders maladies.
    And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
    In that each of you have forsworn his book,
    Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
    For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
    Have found the ground of study's excellence
    Without the beauty of a woman's face?

    From women's eyes this doctrine I derive; They are the ground, the books, the academes From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire
    Why, universal plodding poisons up
    The nimble spirits in the arteries,
    As motion and long-during action tires
    The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
    Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
    You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
    And study too, the causer of your vow;
    For where is any author in the world
    Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
    Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
    And where we are our learning likewise is:
    Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
    Do we not likewise see our learning there?
    O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
    And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
    For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
    In leaden contemplation have found out
    Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
    Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
    Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
    And therefore, finding barren practisers,
    Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
    But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
    Lives not alone immured in the brain;
    But, with the motion of all elements,
    Courses as swift as thought in every power,
    And gives to every power a double power,
    Above their functions and their offices.
    It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
    A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
    A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
    When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
    Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
    Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
    Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
    For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
    Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
    Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
    As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
    And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
    Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
    Never durst poet touch a pen to write
    Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
    O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
    And plant in tyrants mild humility.
    From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
    They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
    They are the books, the arts, the academes,
    That show, contain and nourish all the world:
    Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
    Then fools you were these women to forswear,
    Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
    For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
    Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
    Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
    Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
    Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
    Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
    It is religion to be thus forsworn,
    For charity itself fulfills the law,
    And who can sever love from charity?

FERDINAND

    Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!

BIRON

    Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
    Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
    In conflict that you get the sun of them.

LONGAVILLE

    Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
    Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?

FERDINAND

    And win them too: therefore let us devise
    Some entertainment for them in their tents.

BIRON

    First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
    Then homeward every man attach the hand
    Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
    We will with some strange pastime solace them,
    Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
    For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
    Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.

FERDINAND

    Away, away! no time shall be omitted
    That will betime, and may by us be fitted.

BIRON

    Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
    And justice always whirls in equal measure:
    Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
    If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

ACT V
SCENE I. The same.

    Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL

HOLOFERNES

    Satis quod sufficit.

SIR NATHANIEL

    I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner
    have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
    scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
    impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
    out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
    a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-
    nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.

HOLOFERNES

    Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his
    discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
    ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
    behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
    too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
    were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.

SIR NATHANIEL

    A most singular and choice epithet.

    Draws out his table-book

HOLOFERNES

    He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer
    than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
    fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
    point-devise companions; such rackers of
    orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
    say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,
    e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
    half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
    abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he
    would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
    insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Laus Deo, bene intelligo.

HOLOFERNES

    Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,
    'twill serve.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Videsne quis venit?

HOLOFERNES

    Video, et gaudeo.

    Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, MOTH, and COSTARD
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Chirrah!

    To MOTH

HOLOFERNES

    Quare chirrah, not sirrah?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Men of peace, well encountered.

HOLOFERNES

    Most military sir, salutation.

MOTH

    [Aside to COSTARD] They have been at a great feast
    of languages, and stolen the scraps.

COSTARD

    O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
    I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
    for thou art not so long by the head as
    honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
    swallowed than a flap-dragon.

MOTH

    Peace! the peal begins.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    [To HOLOFERNES] Monsieur, are you not lettered?

MOTH

    Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,
    b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?

HOLOFERNES

    Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.

MOTH

    Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.

HOLOFERNES

    Quis, quis, thou consonant?

MOTH

    The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or
    the fifth, if I.

HOLOFERNES

    I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--

MOTH

    The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
    touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
    home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!

MOTH

    Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.

HOLOFERNES

    What is the figure? what is the figure?

MOTH

    Horns.

HOLOFERNES

    Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.

MOTH

    Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about
    your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.

COSTARD

    An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
    have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
    remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
    purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
    the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
    bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
    Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
    ends, as they say.

HOLOFERNES

    O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
    barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
    charge-house on the top of the mountain?

HOLOFERNES

    Or mons, the hill.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.

HOLOFERNES

    I do, sans question.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
    affection to congratulate the princess at her
    pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
    rude multitude call the afternoon.

HOLOFERNES

    The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
    liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
    the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
    assure you, sir, I do assure.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
    I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
    inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
    remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
    head: and among other important and most serious
    designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
    that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
    grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
    shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
    with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
    heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
    fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
    greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
    travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
    The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
    implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
    present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
    delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
    antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
    curate and your sweet self are good at such
    eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
    were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
    crave your assistance.

HOLOFERNES

    Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
    Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
    show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
    our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
    gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
    the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
    Nine Worthies.

SIR NATHANIEL

    Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?

HOLOFERNES

    Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,
    Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
    limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
    page, Hercules,--
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
    that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.

HOLOFERNES

    Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
    minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
    snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.

MOTH

    An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
    hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
    crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
    offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    For the rest of the Worthies?--

HOLOFERNES

    I will play three myself.

MOTH

    Thrice-worthy gentleman!
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Shall I tell you a thing?

HOLOFERNES

    We attend.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
    beseech you, follow.

HOLOFERNES

    Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.

DULL

    Nor understood none neither, sir.

HOLOFERNES

    Allons! we will employ thee.

DULL

    I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
    On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.

HOLOFERNES

    Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!

    Exeunt
    LOVE'S LABOURS LOST

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA

PRINCESS

    Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
    If fairings come thus plentifully in:
    A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
    Look you what I have from the loving king.

ROSALINE

    Madame, came nothing else along with that?

PRINCESS

    Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
    As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
    Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
    That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.

ROSALINE

    That was the way to make his godhead wax,
    For he hath been five thousand years a boy.

KATHARINE

    Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.

ROSALINE

    You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.

KATHARINE

    He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
    And so she died: had she been light, like you,
    Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
    She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
    And so may you; for a light heart lives long.

ROSALINE

    What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?

KATHARINE

    A light condition in a beauty dark.

ROSALINE

    We need more light to find your meaning out.

KATHARINE

    You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
    Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.

ROSALINE

    Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.

KATHARINE

    So do not you, for you are a light wench.

ROSALINE

    Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.

KATHARINE

    You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.

ROSALINE

    Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'

PRINCESS

    Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
    But Rosaline, you have a favour too:
    Who sent it? and what is it?

ROSALINE

    I would you knew:
    An if my face were but as fair as yours,
    My favour were as great; be witness this.
    Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
    The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
    I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
    I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
    O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!

PRINCESS

    Any thing like?

ROSALINE

    Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.

PRINCESS

    Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.

KATHARINE

    Fair as a text B in a copy-book.

ROSALINE

    'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
    My red dominical, my golden letter:
    O, that your face were not so full of O's!

KATHARINE

    A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.

PRINCESS

    But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?

KATHARINE

    Madam, this glove.

PRINCESS

    Did he not send you twain?

KATHARINE

    Yes, madam, and moreover
    Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
    A huge translation of hypocrisy,
    Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.

MARIA

    This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
    The letter is too long by half a mile.

PRINCESS

    I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
    The chain were longer and the letter short?

MARIA

    Ay, or I would these hands might never part.

PRINCESS

    We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.

ROSALINE

    They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
    That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
    O that I knew he were but in by the week!
    How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
    And wait the season and observe the times
    And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
    And shape his service wholly to my hests
    And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
    So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
    That he should be my fool and I his fate.

PRINCESS

    None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
    As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
    Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
    And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.

ROSALINE

    The blood of youth burns not with such excess
    As gravity's revolt to wantonness.

MARIA

    Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
    As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
    Since all the power thereof it doth apply
    To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.

PRINCESS

    Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.

    Enter BOYET

BOYET

    O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?

PRINCESS

    Thy news Boyet?

BOYET

    Prepare, madam, prepare!
    Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
    Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
    Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
    Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
    Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.

PRINCESS

    Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
    That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.

BOYET

    Under the cool shade of a sycamore
    I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
    When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
    Toward that shade I might behold addrest
    The king and his companions: warily
    I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
    And overheard what you shall overhear,
    That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
    Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
    That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
    Action and accent did they teach him there;
    'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
    And ever and anon they made a doubt
    Presence majestical would put him out,
    'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
    Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
    The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
    I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
    With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
    Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
    One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
    A better speech was never spoke before;
    Another, with his finger and his thumb,
    Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
    The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
    The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
    With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
    With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
    That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
    To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.

PRINCESS

    But what, but what, come they to visit us?

BOYET

    They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
    Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
    Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
    And every one his love-feat will advance
    Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
    By favours several which they did bestow.

PRINCESS

    And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
    For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;
    And not a man of them shall have the grace,
    Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
    Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
    And then the king will court thee for his dear;
    Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
    So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
    And change your favours too; so shall your loves
    Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.

ROSALINE

    Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.

KATHARINE

    But in this changing what is your intent?

PRINCESS

    The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
    They do it but in mocking merriment;
    And mock for mock is only my intent.
    Their several counsels they unbosom shall
    To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
    Upon the next occasion that we meet,
    With visages displayed, to talk and greet.

ROSALINE

    But shall we dance, if they desire to't?

PRINCESS

    No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
    Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
    But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.

BOYET

    Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
    And quite divorce his memory from his part.

PRINCESS

    Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
    The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
    There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
    To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
    So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
    And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.

    Trumpets sound within

BOYET

    The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.

    The Ladies mask

    Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked

MOTH

    All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--

BOYET

    Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.

MOTH

    A holy parcel of the fairest dames.

    The Ladies turn their backs to him
    That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!

BIRON

    [Aside to MOTH] Their eyes, villain, their eyes!

MOTH

    That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--

BOYET

    True; out indeed.

MOTH

    Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
    Not to behold--

BIRON

    [Aside to MOTH] Once to behold, rogue.

MOTH

    Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
    --with your sun-beamed eyes--

BOYET

    They will not answer to that epithet;
    You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'

MOTH

    They do not mark me, and that brings me out.

BIRON

    Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!

    Exit MOTH

ROSALINE

    What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
    If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:
    That some plain man recount their purposes
    Know what they would.

BOYET

    What would you with the princess?

BIRON

    Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

ROSALINE

    What would they, say they?

BOYET

    Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.

ROSALINE

    Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.

BOYET

    She says, you have it, and you may be gone.

FERDINAND

    Say to her, we have measured many miles
    To tread a measure with her on this grass.

BOYET

    They say, that they have measured many a mile
    To tread a measure with you on this grass.

ROSALINE

    It is not so. Ask them how many inches
    Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
    The measure then of one is easily told.

BOYET

    If to come hither you have measured miles,
    And many miles, the princess bids you tell
    How many inches doth fill up one mile.

BIRON

    Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.

BOYET

    She hears herself.

ROSALINE

    How many weary steps,
    Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
    Are number'd in the travel of one mile?

BIRON

    We number nothing that we spend for you:
    Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
    That we may do it still without accompt.
    Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
    That we, like savages, may worship it.

ROSALINE

    My face is but a moon, and clouded too.

FERDINAND

    Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
    Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
    Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.

ROSALINE

    O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
    Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.

FERDINAND

    Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
    Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.

ROSALINE

    Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.

    Music plays
    Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.

FERDINAND

    Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?

ROSALINE

    You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.

FERDINAND

    Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
    The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.

ROSALINE

    Our ears vouchsafe it.

FERDINAND

    But your legs should do it.

ROSALINE

    Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
    We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.

FERDINAND

    Why take we hands, then?

ROSALINE

    Only to part friends:
    Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.

FERDINAND

    More measure of this measure; be not nice.

ROSALINE

    We can afford no more at such a price.

FERDINAND

    Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?

ROSALINE

    Your absence only.

FERDINAND

    That can never be.

ROSALINE

    Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
    Twice to your visor, and half once to you.

FERDINAND

    If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.

ROSALINE

    In private, then.

FERDINAND

    I am best pleased with that.

    They converse apart

BIRON

    White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.

PRINCESS

    Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.

BIRON

    Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
    Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
    There's half-a-dozen sweets.

PRINCESS

    Seventh sweet, adieu:
    Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.

BIRON

    One word in secret.

PRINCESS

    Let it not be sweet.

BIRON

    Thou grievest my gall.

PRINCESS

    Gall! bitter.

BIRON

    Therefore meet.

    They converse apart

DUMAIN

    Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?

MARIA

    Name it.

DUMAIN

    Fair lady,--

MARIA

    Say you so? Fair lord,--
    Take that for your fair lady.

DUMAIN

    Please it you,
    As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.

    They converse apart

KATHARINE

    What, was your vizard made without a tongue?

LONGAVILLE

    I know the reason, lady, why you ask.

KATHARINE

    O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.

LONGAVILLE

    You have a double tongue within your mask,
    And would afford my speechless vizard half.

KATHARINE

    Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?

LONGAVILLE

    A calf, fair lady!

KATHARINE

    No, a fair lord calf.

LONGAVILLE

    Let's part the word.

KATHARINE

    No, I'll not be your half
    Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.

LONGAVILLE

    Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
    Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.

KATHARINE

    Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.

LONGAVILLE

    One word in private with you, ere I die.

KATHARINE

    Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.

    They converse apart

BOYET

    The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
    As is the razor's edge invisible,
    Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
    Above the sense of sense; so sensible
    Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
    Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.

ROSALINE

    Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.

BIRON

    By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!

FERDINAND

    Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.

PRINCESS

    Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.

    Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors
    Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?

BOYET

    Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.

ROSALINE

    Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.

PRINCESS

    O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
    Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
    Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
    This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.

ROSALINE

    O, they were all in lamentable cases!
    The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.

PRINCESS

    Biron did swear himself out of all suit.

MARIA

    Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
    No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.

KATHARINE

    Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
    And trow you what he called me?

PRINCESS

    Qualm, perhaps.

KATHARINE

    Yes, in good faith.

PRINCESS

    Go, sickness as thou art!

ROSALINE

    Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
    But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.

PRINCESS

    And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.

KATHARINE

    And Longaville was for my service born.

MARIA

    Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.

BOYET

    Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
    Immediately they will again be here
    In their own shapes; for it can never be
    They will digest this harsh indignity.

PRINCESS

    Will they return?

BOYET

    They will, they will, God knows,
    And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
    Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
    Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.

PRINCESS

    How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.

BOYET

    Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
    Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
    Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.

PRINCESS

    Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
    If they return in their own shapes to woo?

ROSALINE

    Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
    Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
    Let us complain to them what fools were here,
    Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
    And wonder what they were and to what end
    Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
    And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
    Should be presented at our tent to us.

BOYET

    Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.

PRINCESS

    Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.

    Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA

    Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in their proper habits

FERDINAND

    Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?

BOYET

    Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
    Command me any service to her thither?

FERDINAND

    That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.

BOYET

    I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.

    Exit

BIRON

    This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
    And utters it again when God doth please:
    He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
    At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
    And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
    Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
    This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
    Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
    A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
    That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
    This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
    That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
    In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
    A mean most meanly; and in ushering
    Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
    The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
    This is the flower that smiles on every one,
    To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
    And consciences, that will not die in debt,
    Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.

FERDINAND

    A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
    That put Armado's page out of his part!

BIRON

    See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
    Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?

    Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE

FERDINAND

    All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!

PRINCESS

    'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.

FERDINAND

    Construe my speeches better, if you may.

PRINCESS

    Then wish me better; I will give you leave.

FERDINAND

    We came to visit you, and purpose now
    To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.

PRINCESS

    This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
    Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.

FERDINAND

    Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
    The virtue of your eye must break my oath.

PRINCESS

    You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
    For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
    Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
    As the unsullied lily, I protest,
    A world of torments though I should endure,
    I would not yield to be your house's guest;
    So much I hate a breaking cause to be
    Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.

FERDINAND

    O, you have lived in desolation here,
    Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.

PRINCESS

    Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
    We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
    A mess of Russians left us but of late.

FERDINAND

    How, madam! Russians!

PRINCESS

    Ay, in truth, my lord;
    Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.

ROSALINE

    Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
    My lady, to the manner of the days,
    In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
    We four indeed confronted were with four
    In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
    And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
    They did not bless us with one happy word.
    I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
    When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.

BIRON

    This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
    Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
    With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
    By light we lose light: your capacity
    Is of that nature that to your huge store
    Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.

ROSALINE

    This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--

BIRON

    I am a fool, and full of poverty.

ROSALINE

    But that you take what doth to you belong,
    It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.

BIRON

    O, I am yours, and all that I possess!

ROSALINE

    All the fool mine?

BIRON

    I cannot give you less.

ROSALINE

    Which of the vizards was it that you wore?

BIRON

    Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?

ROSALINE

    There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
    That hid the worse and show'd the better face.

FERDINAND

    We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.

DUMAIN

    Let us confess and turn it to a jest.

PRINCESS

    Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?

ROSALINE

    Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
    Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.

BIRON

    Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
    Can any face of brass hold longer out?

Here stand I

    lady, dart thy skill at me;
    Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
    Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
    Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
    And I will wish thee never more to dance,
    Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
    O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
    Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
    Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
    Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
    Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
    Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
    Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
    Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
    I do forswear them; and I here protest,
    By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
    Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
    In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
    And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
    My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.

ROSALINE

    Sans sans, I pray you.

BIRON

    Yet I have a trick
    Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
    I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
    Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
    They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
    They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
    These lords are visited; you are not free,
    For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.

PRINCESS

    No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.

BIRON

    Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.

ROSALINE

    It is not so; for how can this be true,
    That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?

BIRON

    Peace! for I will not have to do with you.

ROSALINE

    Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.

BIRON

    Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.

FERDINAND

    Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
    Some fair excuse.

PRINCESS

    The fairest is confession.
    Were not you here but even now disguised?

FERDINAND

    Madam, I was.

PRINCESS

    And were you well advised?

FERDINAND

    I was, fair madam.

PRINCESS

    When you then were here,
    What did you whisper in your lady's ear?

FERDINAND

    That more than all the world I did respect her.

PRINCESS

    When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.

FERDINAND

    Upon mine honour, no.

PRINCESS

    Peace, peace! forbear:
    Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.

FERDINAND

    Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.

PRINCESS

    I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
    What did the Russian whisper in your ear?

ROSALINE

    Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
    As precious eyesight, and did value me
    Above this world; adding thereto moreover
    That he would wed me, or else die my lover.

PRINCESS

    God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
    Most honourably doth unhold his word.

FERDINAND

    What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
    I never swore this lady such an oath.

ROSALINE

    By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
    You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.

FERDINAND

    My faith and this the princess I did give:
    I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.

PRINCESS

    Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
    And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
    What, will you have me, or your pearl again?

BIRON

    Neither of either; I remit both twain.
    I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
    Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
    To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
    Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
    Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
    That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
    To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
    Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
    The ladies did change favours: and then we,
    Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
    Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
    We are again forsworn, in will and error.
    Much upon this it is: and might not you

    To BOYET
    Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
    Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
    And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
    And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
    Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
    You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
    Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
    You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
    Wounds like a leaden sword.

BOYET

    Full merrily
    Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.

BIRON

    Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.

    Enter COSTARD
    Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.

COSTARD

    O Lord, sir, they would know
    Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.

BIRON

    What, are there but three?

COSTARD

    No, sir; but it is vara fine,
    For every one pursents three.

BIRON

    And three times thrice is nine.

COSTARD

    Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
    You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
    what we know:
    I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--

BIRON

    Is not nine.

COSTARD

    Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.

BIRON

    By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.

COSTARD

    O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
    by reckoning, sir.

BIRON

    How much is it?

COSTARD

    O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
    sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
    own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
    in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.

BIRON

    Art thou one of the Worthies?

COSTARD

    It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
    Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
    the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.

BIRON

    Go, bid them prepare.

COSTARD

    We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
    some care.

    Exit

FERDINAND

    Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.

BIRON

    We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
    To have one show worse than the king's and his company.

FERDINAND

    I say they shall not come.

PRINCESS

    Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:
    That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
    Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
    Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
    Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
    When great things labouring perish in their birth.

BIRON

    A right description of our sport, my lord.

    Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal
    sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.

    Converses apart with FERDINAND, and delivers him a paper

PRINCESS

    Doth this man serve God?

BIRON

    Why ask you?

PRINCESS

    He speaks not like a man of God's making.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,
    I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
    fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we
    will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.
    I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!

    Exit

FERDINAND

    Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He
    presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the
    Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,
    Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if
    these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
    These four will change habits, and present the other five.

BIRON

    There is five in the first show.

FERDINAND

    You are deceived; 'tis not so.

BIRON

    The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool
    and the boy:--
    Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
    Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.

FERDINAND

    The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.

    Enter COSTARD, for Pompey

COSTARD

    I Pompey am,--

BOYET

    You lie, you are not he.

COSTARD

    I Pompey am,--

BOYET

    With libbard's head on knee.

BIRON

    Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
    with thee.

COSTARD

    I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--

DUMAIN

    The Great.

COSTARD

    It is, 'Great,' sir:--
    Pompey surnamed the Great;
    That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make
    my foe to sweat:
    And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,
    And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,
    If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.

PRINCESS

    Great thanks, great Pompey.

COSTARD

    'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I
    made a little fault in 'Great.'

BIRON

    My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.

    Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander

SIR NATHANIEL

    When in the world I lived, I was the world's
    commander;
    By east, west, north, and south, I spread my
    conquering might:
    My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--

BOYET

    Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.

BIRON

    Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.

PRINCESS

    The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.

SIR NATHANIEL

    When in the world I lived, I was the world's
    commander,--

BOYET

    Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.

BIRON

    Pompey the Great,--

COSTARD

    Your servant, and Costard.

BIRON

    Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.

COSTARD

    [To SIR NATHANIEL] O, sir, you have overthrown
    Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of
    the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds
    his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given
    to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,
    and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.

    SIR NATHANIEL retires
    There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an
    honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a
    marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good
    bowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how
    'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies
    a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.

    Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas; and MOTH, for Hercules

HOLOFERNES

    Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
    Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;
    And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
    Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
    Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
    Ergo I come with this apology.
    Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.

    MOTH retires
    Judas I am,--

DUMAIN

    A Judas!

HOLOFERNES

    Not Iscariot, sir.
    Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.

DUMAIN

    Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.

BIRON

    A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?

HOLOFERNES

    Judas I am,--

DUMAIN

    The more shame for you, Judas.

HOLOFERNES

    What mean you, sir?

BOYET

    To make Judas hang himself.

HOLOFERNES

    Begin, sir; you are my elder.

BIRON

    Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.

HOLOFERNES

    I will not be put out of countenance.

BIRON

    Because thou hast no face.

HOLOFERNES

    What is this?

BOYET

    A cittern-head.

DUMAIN

    The head of a bodkin.

BIRON

    A Death's face in a ring.

LONGAVILLE

    The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.

BOYET

    The pommel of Caesar's falchion.

DUMAIN

    The carved-bone face on a flask.

BIRON

    Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.

DUMAIN

    Ay, and in a brooch of lead.

BIRON

    Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
    And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.

HOLOFERNES

    You have put me out of countenance.

BIRON

    False; we have given thee faces.

HOLOFERNES

    But you have out-faced them all.

BIRON

    An thou wert a lion, we would do so.

BOYET

    Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
    And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?

DUMAIN

    For the latter end of his name.

BIRON

    For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!

HOLOFERNES

    This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.

BOYET

    A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.

    HOLOFERNES retires

PRINCESS

    Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!

    Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, for Hector

BIRON

    Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.

DUMAIN

    Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.

FERDINAND

    Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.

BOYET

    But is this Hector?

FERDINAND

    I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.

LONGAVILLE

    His leg is too big for Hector's.

DUMAIN

    More calf, certain.

BOYET

    No; he is best endued in the small.

BIRON

    This cannot be Hector.

DUMAIN

    He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
    Gave Hector a gift,--

DUMAIN

    A gilt nutmeg.

BIRON

    A lemon.

LONGAVILLE

    Stuck with cloves.

DUMAIN

    No, cloven.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Peace!--
    The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
    Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
    A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea
    From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
    I am that flower,--

DUMAIN

    That mint.

LONGAVILLE

    That columbine.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.

LONGAVILLE

    I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.

DUMAIN

    Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,
    beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
    he was a man. But I will forward with my device.

    To the PRINCESS
    Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.

PRINCESS

    Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.

BOYET

    [Aside to DUMAIN] Loves her by the foot,--

DUMAIN

    [Aside to BOYET] He may not by the yard.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--

COSTARD

    The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she
    is two months on her way.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    What meanest thou?

COSTARD

    Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
    wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in
    her belly already: tis yours.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
    die.

COSTARD

    Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
    quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
    him.

DUMAIN

    Most rare Pompey!

BOYET

    Renowned Pompey!

BIRON

    Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
    Pompey the Huge!

DUMAIN

    Hector trembles.

BIRON

    Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
    on! stir them on!

DUMAIN

    Hector will challenge him.

BIRON

    Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
    sup a flea.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    By the north pole, I do challenge thee.

COSTARD

    I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:
    I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
    let me borrow my arms again.

DUMAIN

    Room for the incensed Worthies!

COSTARD

    I'll do it in my shirt.

DUMAIN

    Most resolute Pompey!

MOTH

    Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you
    not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean
    you? You will lose your reputation.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
    in my shirt.

DUMAIN

    You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet bloods, I both may and will.

BIRON

    What reason have you for't?
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
    woolward for penance.

BOYET

    True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
    linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
    a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
    his heart for a favour.

    Enter MERCADE

MERCADE

    God save you, madam!

PRINCESS

    Welcome, Mercade;
    But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.

MERCADE

    I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
    Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--

PRINCESS

    Dead, for my life!

MERCADE

    Even so; my tale is told.

BIRON

    Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
    seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
    discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.

    Exeunt Worthies

FERDINAND

    How fares your majesty?

PRINCESS

    Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.

FERDINAND

    Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.

PRINCESS

    Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
    For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,
    Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
    In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
    The liberal opposition of our spirits,
    If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
    In the converse of breath: your gentleness
    Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
    A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
    Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
    For my great suit so easily obtain'd.

FERDINAND

    The extreme parts of time extremely forms
    All causes to the purpose of his speed,
    And often at his very loose decides
    That which long process could not arbitrate:
    And though the mourning brow of progeny
    Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
    The holy suit which fain it would convince,
    Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
    Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
    From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
    Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
    As to rejoice at friends but newly found.

PRINCESS

    I understand you not: my griefs are double.

BIRON

    Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
    And by these badges understand the king.
    For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
    Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
    Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
    Even to the opposed end of our intents:
    And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
    As love is full of unbefitting strains,
    All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
    Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
    Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
    Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
    To every varied object in his glance:
    Which parti-coated presence of loose love
    Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
    Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
    Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
    Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
    Our love being yours, the error that love makes
    Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
    By being once false for ever to be true
    To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
    And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
    Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.

PRINCESS

    We have received your letters full of love;
    Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
    And, in our maiden council, rated them
    At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
    As bombast and as lining to the time:
    But more devout than this in our respects
    Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
    In their own fashion, like a merriment.

DUMAIN

    Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.

LONGAVILLE

    So did our looks.

ROSALINE

    We did not quote them so.

FERDINAND

    Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
    Grant us your loves.

PRINCESS

    A time, methinks, too short
    To make a world-without-end bargain in.
    No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
    Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
    If for my love, as there is no such cause,
    You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
    Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
    To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
    Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
    There stay until the twelve celestial signs
    Have brought about the annual reckoning.
    If this austere insociable life
    Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
    If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
    Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
    But that it bear this trial and last love;
    Then, at the expiration of the year,
    Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
    And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
    I will be thine; and till that instant shut
    My woeful self up in a mourning house,
    Raining the tears of lamentation
    For the remembrance of my father's death.
    If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
    Neither entitled in the other's heart.

FERDINAND

    If this, or more than this, I would deny,
    To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
    The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
    Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.

DUMAIN

    But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?

KATHARINE

    A beard, fair health, and honesty;
    With three-fold love I wish you all these three.

DUMAIN

    O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?

KATHARINE

    Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
    I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
    Come when the king doth to my lady come;
    Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.

DUMAIN

    I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.

KATHARINE

    Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.

LONGAVILLE

    What says Maria?

MARIA

    At the twelvemonth's end
    I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.

LONGAVILLE

    I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.

MARIA

    The liker you; few taller are so young.

BIRON

    Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
    Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
    What humble suit attends thy answer there:
    Impose some service on me for thy love.

ROSALINE

    Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
    Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
    Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
    Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
    Which you on all estates will execute
    That lie within the mercy of your wit.
    To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
    And therewithal to win me, if you please,
    Without the which I am not to be won,
    You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
    Visit the speechless sick and still converse
    With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
    With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
    To enforce the pained impotent to smile.

BIRON

    To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
    It cannot be; it is impossible:
    Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.

ROSALINE

    Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
    Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
    Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
    A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
    Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
    Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
    Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
    Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
    And I will have you and that fault withal;
    But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
    And I shall find you empty of that fault,
    Right joyful of your reformation.

BIRON

    A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
    I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.

PRINCESS

    [To FERDINAND] Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.

FERDINAND

    No, madam; we will bring you on your way.

BIRON

    Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
    Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
    Might well have made our sport a comedy.

FERDINAND

    Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
    And then 'twill end.

BIRON

    That's too long for a play.

    Re-enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--

PRINCESS

    Was not that Hector?

DUMAIN

    The worthy knight of Troy.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am
    a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
    plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
    esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
    the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
    owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
    end of our show.

FERDINAND

    Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    Holla! approach.

    Re-enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, MOTH, COSTARD, and others
    This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;
    the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
    cuckoo. Ver, begin.

    THE SONG
    SPRING.
    When daisies pied and violets blue
    And lady-smocks all silver-white
    And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
    Do paint the meadows with delight,
    The cuckoo then, on every tree,
    Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;
    Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
    Unpleasing to a married ear!
    When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
    And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
    When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
    And maidens bleach their summer smocks
    The cuckoo then, on every tree,
    Mocks married men; for thus sings he, Cuckoo;
    Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
    Unpleasing to a married ear!
    WINTER.
    When icicles hang by the wall
    And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
    And Tom bears logs into the hall
    And milk comes frozen home in pail,
    When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
    Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;
    Tu-who, a merry note,
    While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
    When all aloud the wind doth blow
    And coughing drowns the parson's saw
    And birds sit brooding in the snow
    And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
    When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
    Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit;
    Tu-who, a merry note,
    While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
    DON

ADRIANO DE ARMADO

    The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of

Measure for Measure

ACT I
SCENE I. An apartment in the DUKE'S palace.

    Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and Attendants

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Escalus.

ESCALUS

    My lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Of government the properties to unfold,
    Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
    Since I am put to know that your own science
    Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
    My strength can give you: then no more remains,
    But that to your sufficiency as your Worth is able,
    And let them work. The nature of our people,
    Our city's institutions, and the terms
    For common justice, you're as pregnant in
    As art and practise hath enriched any
    That we remember. There is our commission,
    From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
    I say, bid come before us Angelo.

    Exit an Attendant
    What figure of us think you he will bear?
    For you must know, we have with special soul
    Elected him our absence to supply,
    Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
    And given his deputation all the organs
    Of our own power: what think you of it?

ESCALUS

    If any in Vienna be of worth
    To undergo such ample grace and honour,
    It is Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Look where he comes.

    Enter ANGELO

ANGELO

    Always obedient to your grace's will,
    I come to know your pleasure.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Angelo,
    There is a kind of character in thy life,
    That to the observer doth thy history
    Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
    Are not thine own so proper as to waste
    Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
    Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
    Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
    Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
    As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
    But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
    The smallest scruple of her excellence
    But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
    Herself the glory of a creditor,
    Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
    To one that can my part in him advertise;
    Hold therefore, Angelo:--
    In our remove be thou at full ourself;
    Mortality and mercy in Vienna
    Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
    Though first in question, is thy secondary.
    Take thy commission.

ANGELO

    Now, good my lord,
    Let there be some more test made of my metal,
    Before so noble and so great a figure
    Be stamp'd upon it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    No more evasion:
    We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
    Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
    Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
    That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
    Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
    As time and our concernings shall importune,
    How it goes with us, and do look to know
    What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
    To the hopeful execution do I leave you
    Of your commissions.

ANGELO

    Yet give leave, my lord,
    That we may bring you something on the way.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    My haste may not admit it;
    Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
    With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
    So to enforce or qualify the laws
    As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
    I'll privily away. I love the people,
    But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
    Through it do well, I do not relish well
    Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
    Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
    That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.

ANGELO

    The heavens give safety to your purposes!

ESCALUS

    Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!

DUKE

    I thank you. Fare you well.

    Exit

ESCALUS

    I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
    To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
    To look into the bottom of my place:
    A power I have, but of what strength and nature
    I am not yet instructed.

ANGELO

    'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
    And we may soon our satisfaction have
    Touching that point.

ESCALUS

    I'll wait upon your honour.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A Street.

    Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen

LUCIO

    If the duke with the other dukes come not to
    composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
    the dukes fall upon the king.

First Gentleman

    Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
    Hungary's!

Second Gentleman

    Amen.

LUCIO

    Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
    went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
    one out of the table.

Second Gentleman

    'Thou shalt not steal'?

LUCIO

    Ay, that he razed.

First Gentleman

    Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
    all the rest from their functions: they put forth
    to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
    the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
    well that prays for peace.

Second Gentleman

    I never heard any soldier dislike it.

LUCIO

    I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
    grace was said.

Second Gentleman

    No? a dozen times at least.

First Gentleman

    What, in metre?

LUCIO

    In any proportion or in any language.

First Gentleman

    I think, or in any religion.

LUCIO

    Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
    controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
    wicked villain, despite of all grace.

First Gentleman

    Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.

LUCIO

    I grant; as there may between the lists and the
    velvet. Thou art the list.

First Gentleman

    And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
    a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
    be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
    art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
    feelingly now?

LUCIO

    I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
    feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
    confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
    live, forget to drink after thee.

First Gentleman

    I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?

Second Gentleman

    Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.

LUCIO

    Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
    have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--

Second Gentleman

    To what, I pray?

LUCIO

    Judge.

Second Gentleman

    To three thousand dolours a year.

First Gentleman

    Ay, and more.

LUCIO

    A French crown more.

First Gentleman

    Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
    art full of error; I am sound.

LUCIO

    Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
    things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
    impiety has made a feast of thee.

    Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE

First Gentleman

    How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
    to prison was worth five thousand of you all.

Second Gentleman

    Who's that, I pray thee?

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.

First Gentleman

    Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
    him carried away; and, which is more, within these
    three days his head to be chopped off.

LUCIO

    But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
    Art thou sure of this?

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
    Julietta with child.

LUCIO

    Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
    hours since, and he was ever precise in
    promise-keeping.

Second Gentleman

    Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
    speech we had to such a purpose.

First Gentleman

    But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.

LUCIO

    Away! let's go learn the truth of it.

    Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
    with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
    custom-shrunk.

    Enter POMPEY
    How now! what's the news with you?

POMPEY

    Yonder man is carried to prison.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    Well; what has he done?

POMPEY

    A woman.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    But what's his offence?

POMPEY

    Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    What, is there a maid with child by him?

POMPEY

    No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
    not heard of the proclamation, have you?

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    What proclamation, man?

POMPEY

    All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    And what shall become of those in the city?

POMPEY

    They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
    but that a wise burgher put in for them.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
    pulled down?

POMPEY

    To the ground, mistress.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
    What shall become of me?

POMPEY

    Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
    clients: though you change your place, you need not
    change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
    Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
    have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
    will be considered.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.

POMPEY

    Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
    prison; and there's Madam Juliet.

    Exeunt

    Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers

CLAUDIO

    Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
    Bear me to prison, where I am committed.

Provost

    I do it not in evil disposition,
    But from Lord Angelo by special charge.

CLAUDIO

    Thus can the demigod Authority
    Make us pay down for our offence by weight
    The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
    On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.

    Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen

LUCIO

    Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?

CLAUDIO

    From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
    As surfeit is the father of much fast,
    So every scope by the immoderate use
    Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
    Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
    A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.

LUCIO

    If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
    send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
    the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
    as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
    offence, Claudio?

CLAUDIO

    What but to speak of would offend again.

LUCIO

    What, is't murder?

CLAUDIO

    No.

LUCIO

    Lechery?

CLAUDIO

    Call it so.

Provost

    Away, sir! you must go.

CLAUDIO

    One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.

LUCIO

    A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
    Is lechery so look'd after?

CLAUDIO

    Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
    I got possession of Julietta's bed:
    You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
    Save that we do the denunciation lack
    Of outward order: this we came not to,
    Only for propagation of a dower
    Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
    From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
    Till time had made them for us. But it chances
    The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
    With character too gross is writ on Juliet.

LUCIO

    With child, perhaps?

CLAUDIO

    Unhappily, even so.
    And the new deputy now for the duke--
    Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
    Or whether that the body public be
    A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
    Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
    He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
    Whether the tyranny be in his place,
    Or in his emmence that fills it up,
    I stagger in:--but this new governor
    Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
    Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
    So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
    And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
    Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
    Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.

LUCIO

    I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
    thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
    may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
    him.

CLAUDIO

    I have done so, but he's not to be found.
    I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
    This day my sister should the cloister enter
    And there receive her approbation:
    Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
    Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
    To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
    I have great hope in that; for in her youth
    There is a prone and speechless dialect,
    Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
    When she will play with reason and discourse,
    And well she can persuade.

LUCIO

    I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
    like, which else would stand under grievous
    imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
    would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
    game of tick-tack. I'll to her.

CLAUDIO

    I thank you, good friend Lucio.

LUCIO

    Within two hours.

CLAUDIO

    Come, officer, away!

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A monastery.

    Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS

DUKE VINCENTIO

    No, holy father; throw away that thought;
    Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
    Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
    To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
    More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
    Of burning youth.

FRIAR THOMAS

    May your grace speak of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    My holy sir, none better knows than you
    How I have ever loved the life removed
    And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
    Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
    I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
    A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
    My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
    And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
    For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
    And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
    You will demand of me why I do this?

FRIAR THOMAS

    Gladly, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
    The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
    Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
    Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
    That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
    Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
    Only to stick it in their children's sight
    For terror, not to use, in time the rod
    Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
    Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
    And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
    The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
    Goes all decorum.

FRIAR THOMAS

    It rested in your grace
    To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
    And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
    Than in Lord Angelo.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I do fear, too dreadful:
    Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
    'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
    For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
    When evil deeds have their permissive pass
    And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
    I have on Angelo imposed the office;
    Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
    And yet my nature never in the fight
    To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
    I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
    Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
    Supply me with the habit and instruct me
    How I may formally in person bear me
    Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
    At our more leisure shall I render you;
    Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
    Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
    That his blood flows, or that his appetite
    Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
    If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A nunnery.

    Enter ISABELLA and FRANCISCA

ISABELLA

    And have you nuns no farther privileges?

FRANCISCA

    Are not these large enough?

ISABELLA

    Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;
    But rather wishing a more strict restraint
    Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.

LUCIO

    [Within] Ho! Peace be in this place!

ISABELLA

    Who's that which calls?

FRANCISCA

    It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,
    Turn you the key, and know his business of him;
    You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.
    When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men
    But in the presence of the prioress:
    Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,
    Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.
    He calls again; I pray you, answer him.

    Exit

ISABELLA

    Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls

    Enter LUCIO

LUCIO

    Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
    Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
    As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
    A novice of this place and the fair sister
    To her unhappy brother Claudio?

ISABELLA

    Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
    The rather for I now must make you know
    I am that Isabella and his sister.

LUCIO

    Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
    Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.

ISABELLA

    Woe me! for what?

LUCIO

    For that which, if myself might be his judge,
    He should receive his punishment in thanks:
    He hath got his friend with child.

ISABELLA

    Sir, make me not your story.

LUCIO

    It is true.
    I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
    With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
    Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
    I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
    By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
    And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
    As with a saint.

ISABELLA

    You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.

LUCIO

    Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
    Your brother and his lover have embraced:
    As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
    That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
    To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
    Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.

ISABELLA

    Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?

LUCIO

    Is she your cousin?

ISABELLA

    Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
    By vain though apt affection.

LUCIO

    She it is.

ISABELLA

    O, let him marry her.

LUCIO

    This is the point.
    The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
    Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
    In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
    By those that know the very nerves of state,
    His givings-out were of an infinite distance
    From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
    And with full line of his authority,
    Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
    Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
    The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
    But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
    With profits of the mind, study and fast.
    He--to give fear to use and liberty,
    Which have for long run by the hideous law,
    As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
    Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
    Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
    And follows close the rigour of the statute,
    To make him an example. All hope is gone,
    Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
    To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
    'Twixt you and your poor brother.

ISABELLA

    Doth he so seek his life?

LUCIO

    Has censured him
    Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
    A warrant for his execution.

ISABELLA

    Alas! what poor ability's in me
    To do him good?

LUCIO

    Assay the power you have.

ISABELLA

    My power? Alas, I doubt--

LUCIO

    Our doubts are traitors
    And make us lose the good we oft might win
    By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
    And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
    Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
    All their petitions are as freely theirs
    As they themselves would owe them.

ISABELLA

    I'll see what I can do.

LUCIO

    But speedily.

ISABELLA

    I will about it straight;
    No longer staying but to give the mother
    Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
    Commend me to my brother: soon at night
    I'll send him certain word of my success.

LUCIO

    I take my leave of you.

ISABELLA

    Good sir, adieu.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A hall In ANGELO's house.

    Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost, Officers, and other Attendants, behind

ANGELO

    We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
    Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
    And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
    Their perch and not their terror.

ESCALUS

    Ay, but yet
    Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
    Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
    Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
    Let but your honour know,
    Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
    That, in the working of your own affections,
    Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
    Or that the resolute acting of your blood
    Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
    Whether you had not sometime in your life
    Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
    And pull'd the law upon you.

ANGELO

    'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
    Another thing to fall. I not deny,
    The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
    May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
    Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
    That justice seizes: what know the laws
    That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
    The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
    Because we see it; but what we do not see
    We tread upon, and never think of it.
    You may not so extenuate his offence
    For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
    When I, that censure him, do so offend,
    Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
    And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.

ESCALUS

    Be it as your wisdom will.

ANGELO

    Where is the provost?

Provost

    Here, if it like your honour.

ANGELO

    See that Claudio
    Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
    Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
    For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.

    Exit Provost

ESCALUS

    [Aside] Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
    Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:
    Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:
    And some condemned for a fault alone.

    Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY

ELBOW

    Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
    a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
    common houses, I know no law: bring them away.

ANGELO

    How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?

ELBOW

    If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
    constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
    justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
    honour two notorious benefactors.

ANGELO

    Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
    they not malefactors?

ELBOW

    If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
    are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
    of; and void of all profanation in the world that
    good Christians ought to have.

ESCALUS

    This comes off well; here's a wise officer.

ANGELO

    Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
    name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?

POMPEY

    He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.

ANGELO

    What are you, sir?

ELBOW

    He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
    serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
    say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
    professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.

ESCALUS

    How know you that?

ELBOW

    My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--

ESCALUS

    How? thy wife?

ELBOW

    Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--

ESCALUS

    Dost thou detest her therefore?

ELBOW

    I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
    she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
    it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.

ESCALUS

    How dost thou know that, constable?

ELBOW

    Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
    cardinally given, might have been accused in
    fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.

ESCALUS

    By the woman's means?

ELBOW

    Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
    spit in his face, so she defied him.

POMPEY

    Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.

ELBOW

    Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
    man; prove it.

ESCALUS

    Do you hear how he misplaces?

POMPEY

    Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
    saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;
    sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
    distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
    dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
    such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
    good dishes,--

ESCALUS

    Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.

POMPEY

    No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
    the right: but to the point. As I say, this
    Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
    being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
    prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
    Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
    rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
    honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
    not give you three-pence again.

FROTH

    No, indeed.

POMPEY

    Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
    cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--

FROTH

    Ay, so I did indeed.

POMPEY

    Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
    remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
    cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
    good diet, as I told you,--

FROTH

    All this is true.

POMPEY

    Why, very well, then,--

ESCALUS

    Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
    was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
    complain of? Come me to what was done to her.

POMPEY

    Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.

ESCALUS

    No, sir, nor I mean it not.

POMPEY

    Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
    leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
    here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
    father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
    Master Froth?

FROTH

    All-hallond eve.

POMPEY

    Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
    sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
    the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
    to sit, have you not?

FROTH

    I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.

POMPEY

    Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.

ANGELO

    This will last out a night in Russia,
    When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
    And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
    Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.

ESCALUS

    I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.

    Exit ANGELO
    Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?

POMPEY

    Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.

ELBOW

    I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.

POMPEY

    I beseech your honour, ask me.

ESCALUS

    Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?

POMPEY

    I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
    Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
    good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?

ESCALUS

    Ay, sir, very well.

POMPEY

    Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.

ESCALUS

    Well, I do so.

POMPEY

    Doth your honour see any harm in his face?

ESCALUS

    Why, no.

POMPEY

    I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
    thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
    worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
    constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
    your honour.

ESCALUS

    He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?

ELBOW

    First, an it like you, the house is a respected
    house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
    mistress is a respected woman.

POMPEY

    By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
    person than any of us all.

ELBOW

    Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
    time has yet to come that she was ever respected
    with man, woman, or child.

POMPEY

    Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.

ESCALUS

    Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
    this true?

ELBOW

    O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
    Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
    to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
    with me, let not your worship think me the poor
    duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
    I'll have mine action of battery on thee.

ESCALUS

    If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
    action of slander too.

ELBOW

    Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
    your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?

ESCALUS

    Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
    that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
    continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
    are.

ELBOW

    Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
    wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
    to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.

ESCALUS

    Where were you born, friend?

FROTH

    Here in Vienna, sir.

ESCALUS

    Are you of fourscore pounds a year?

FROTH

    Yes, an't please you, sir.

ESCALUS

    So. What trade are you of, sir?

POMPHEY

    Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.

ESCALUS

    Your mistress' name?

POMPHEY

    Mistress Overdone.

ESCALUS

    Hath she had any more than one husband?

POMPEY

    Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.

ESCALUS

    Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
    Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
    tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
    will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
    more of you.

FROTH

    I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
    come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
    in.

ESCALUS

    Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.

    Exit FROTH
    Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
    name, Master tapster?

POMPEY

    Pompey.

ESCALUS

    What else?

POMPEY

    Bum, sir.

ESCALUS

    Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
    so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
    Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
    howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
    not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.

POMPEY

    Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.

ESCALUS

    How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
    do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?

POMPEY

    If the law would allow it, sir.

ESCALUS

    But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
    not be allowed in Vienna.

POMPEY

    Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
    youth of the city?

ESCALUS

    No, Pompey.

POMPEY

    Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
    If your worship will take order for the drabs and
    the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.

ESCALUS

    There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
    it is but heading and hanging.

POMPEY

    If you head and hang all that offend that way but
    for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
    commission for more heads: if this law hold in
    Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
    after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
    come to pass, say Pompey told you so.

ESCALUS

    Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
    prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
    you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
    no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
    I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
    Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
    have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.

POMPEY

    I thank your worship for your good counsel:

    Aside
    but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall
    better determine.
    Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
    The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.

    Exit

ESCALUS

    Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
    constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?

ELBOW

    Seven year and a half, sir.

ESCALUS

    I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
    continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?

ELBOW

    And a half, sir.

ESCALUS

    Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
    wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
    in your ward sufficient to serve it?

ELBOW

    Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
    are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
    do it for some piece of money, and go through with
    all.

ESCALUS

    Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
    the most sufficient of your parish.

ELBOW

    To your worship's house, sir?

ESCALUS

    To my house. Fare you well.

    Exit ELBOW
    What's o'clock, think you?

Justice

    Eleven, sir.

ESCALUS

    I pray you home to dinner with me.

Justice

    I humbly thank you.

ESCALUS

    It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
    But there's no remedy.

Justice

    Lord Angelo is severe.

ESCALUS

    It is but needful:
    Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
    Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
    But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
    Come, sir.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Another room in the same.

    Enter Provost and a Servant

Servant

    He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
    I'll tell him of you.

Provost

    Pray you, do.

    Exit Servant
    I'll know
    His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
    He hath but as offended in a dream!
    All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
    To die for't!

    Enter ANGELO

ANGELO

    Now, what's the matter. Provost?

Provost

    Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?

ANGELO

    Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
    Why dost thou ask again?

Provost

    Lest I might be too rash:
    Under your good correction, I have seen,
    When, after execution, judgment hath
    Repented o'er his doom.

ANGELO

    Go to; let that be mine:
    Do you your office, or give up your place,
    And you shall well be spared.

Provost

    I crave your honour's pardon.
    What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
    She's very near her hour.

ANGELO

    Dispose of her
    To some more fitter place, and that with speed.

    Re-enter Servant

Servant

    Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
    Desires access to you.

ANGELO

    Hath he a sister?

Provost

    Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
    And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
    If not already.

ANGELO

    Well, let her be admitted.

    Exit Servant
    See you the fornicatress be removed:
    Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
    There shall be order for't.

    Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO

Provost

    God save your honour!

ANGELO

    Stay a little while.

    To ISABELLA
    You're welcome: what's your will?

ISABELLA

    I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
    Please but your honour hear me.

ANGELO

    Well; what's your suit?

ISABELLA

    There is a vice that most I do abhor,
    And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
    For which I would not plead, but that I must;
    For which I must not plead, but that I am
    At war 'twixt will and will not.

ANGELO

    Well; the matter?

ISABELLA

    I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
    I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
    And not my brother.

Provost

    [Aside] Heaven give thee moving graces!

ANGELO

    Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
    Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
    Mine were the very cipher of a function,
    To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
    And let go by the actor.

ISABELLA

    O just but severe law!
    I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] Give't not o'er so: to him
    again, entreat him;
    Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
    You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
    You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:
    To him, I say!

ISABELLA

    Must he needs die?

ANGELO

    Maiden, no remedy.

ISABELLA

    Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
    And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.

ANGELO

    I will not do't.

ISABELLA

    But can you, if you would?

ANGELO

    Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.

ISABELLA

    But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
    If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
    A s mine is to him?

ANGELO

    He's sentenced; 'tis too late.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] You are too cold.

ISABELLA

    Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
    May call it back again. Well, believe this,
    No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
    Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
    The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
    Become them with one half so good a grace
    As mercy does.
    If he had been as you and you as he,
    You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
    Would not have been so stern.

ANGELO

    Pray you, be gone.

ISABELLA

    I would to heaven I had your potency,
    And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
    No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
    And what a prisoner.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA]
    Ay, touch him; there's the vein.

ANGELO

    Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
    And you but waste your words.

ISABELLA

    Alas, alas!
    Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
    And He that might the vantage best have took
    Found out the remedy. How would you be,
    If He, which is the top of judgment, should
    But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
    And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
    Like man new made.

ANGELO

    Be you content, fair maid;
    It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
    Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
    It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.

ISABELLA

    To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
    He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
    We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
    With less respect than we do minister
    To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
    Who is it that hath died for this offence?
    There's many have committed it.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] Ay, well said.

ANGELO

    The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
    Those many had not dared to do that evil,
    If the first that did the edict infringe
    Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
    Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
    Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
    Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
    And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
    Are now to have no successive degrees,
    But, ere they live, to end.

ISABELLA

    Yet show some pity.

ANGELO

    I show it most of all when I show justice;
    For then I pity those I do not know,
    Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
    And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
    Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
    Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.

ISABELLA

    So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
    And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
    To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
    To use it like a giant.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] That's well said.

ISABELLA

    Could great men thunder
    As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
    For every pelting, petty officer
    Would use his heaven for thunder;
    Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
    Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
    Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
    Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
    Drest in a little brief authority,
    Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
    His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
    Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
    As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
    Would all themselves laugh mortal.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] O, to him, to him, wench! he
    will relent;
    He's coming; I perceive 't.

Provost

    [Aside] Pray heaven she win him!

ISABELLA

    We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
    Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
    But in the less foul profanation.

LUCIO

    Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.

ISABELLA

    That in the captain's but a choleric word,
    Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] Art avised o' that? more on 't.

ANGELO

    Why do you put these sayings upon me?

ISABELLA

    Because authority, though it err like others,
    Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
    That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
    Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
    That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
    A natural guiltiness such as is his,
    Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
    Against my brother's life.

ANGELO

    [Aside] She speaks, and 'tis
    Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.

ISABELLA

    Gentle my lord, turn back.

ANGELO

    I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.

ISABELLA

    Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.

ANGELO

    How! bribe me?

ISABELLA

    Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] You had marr'd all else.

ISABELLA

    Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
    Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
    As fancy values them; but with true prayers
    That shall be up at heaven and enter there
    Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
    From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
    To nothing temporal.

ANGELO

    Well; come to me to-morrow.

LUCIO

    [Aside to ISABELLA] Go to; 'tis well; away!

ISABELLA

    Heaven keep your honour safe!

ANGELO

    [Aside] Amen:
    For I am that way going to temptation,
    Where prayers cross.

ISABELLA

    At what hour to-morrow
    Shall I attend your lordship?

ANGELO

    At any time 'fore noon.

ISABELLA

    'Save your honour!

    Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and Provost

ANGELO

    From thee, even from thy virtue!
    What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
    The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
    Ha!
    Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
    That, lying by the violet in the sun,
    Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
    Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
    That modesty may more betray our sense
    Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
    Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
    And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
    What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
    Dost thou desire her foully for those things
    That make her good? O, let her brother live!
    Thieves for their robbery have authority
    When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
    That I desire to hear her speak again,
    And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
    O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
    With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
    Is that temptation that doth goad us on
    To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
    With all her double vigour, art and nature,
    Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
    Subdues me quite. Even till now,
    When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.

    Exit

SCENE III. A room in a prison.

    Enter, severally, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a friar, and Provost

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.

Provost

    I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Bound by my charity and my blest order,
    I come to visit the afflicted spirits
    Here in the prison. Do me the common right
    To let me see them and to make me know
    The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
    To them accordingly.

Provost

    I would do more than that, if more were needful.

    Enter JULIET
    Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
    Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
    Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
    And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
    More fit to do another such offence
    Than die for this.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    When must he die?

Provost

    As I do think, to-morrow.
    I have provided for you: stay awhile,

    To JULIET
    And you shall be conducted.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?

JULIET

    I do; and bear the shame most patiently.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
    And try your penitence, if it be sound,
    Or hollowly put on.

JULIET

    I'll gladly learn.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Love you the man that wrong'd you?

JULIET

    Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    So then it seems your most offenceful act
    Was mutually committed?

JULIET

    Mutually.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.

JULIET

    I do confess it, and repent it, father.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
    As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
    Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
    Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
    But as we stand in fear,--

JULIET

    I do repent me, as it is an evil,
    And take the shame with joy.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    There rest.
    Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
    And I am going with instruction to him.
    Grace go with you, Benedicite!

    Exit

JULIET

    Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,
    That respites me a life, whose very comfort
    Is still a dying horror!

Provost

    'Tis pity of him.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.

    Enter ANGELO

ANGELO

    When I would pray and think, I think and pray
    To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
    Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
    Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
    As if I did but only chew his name;
    And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
    Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
    Is like a good thing, being often read,
    Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
    Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
    Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
    Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
    How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
    Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
    To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
    Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
    'Tis not the devil's crest.

    Enter a Servant
    How now! who's there?

Servant

    One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.

ANGELO

    Teach her the way.

    Exit Servant
    O heavens!
    Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
    Making both it unable for itself,
    And dispossessing all my other parts
    Of necessary fitness?
    So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
    Come all to help him, and so stop the air
    By which he should revive: and even so
    The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
    Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
    Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
    Must needs appear offence.

    Enter ISABELLA
    How now, fair maid?

ISABELLA

    I am come to know your pleasure.

ANGELO

    That you might know it, would much better please me
    Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.

ISABELLA

    Even so. Heaven keep your honour!

ANGELO

    Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,

As long as you or I

    yet he must die.

ISABELLA

    Under your sentence?

ANGELO

    Yea.

ISABELLA

    When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
    Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
    That his soul sicken not.

ANGELO

    Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
    To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
    A man already made, as to remit
    Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
    In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
    Falsely to take away a life true made
    As to put metal in restrained means
    To make a false one.

ISABELLA

    'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.

ANGELO

    Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
    Which had you rather, that the most just law
    Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
    Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
    As she that he hath stain'd?

ISABELLA

    Sir, believe this,
    I had rather give my body than my soul.

ANGELO

    I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
    Stand more for number than for accompt.

ISABELLA

    How say you?

ANGELO

    Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
    Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
    I, now the voice of the recorded law,
    Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
    Might there not be a charity in sin
    To save this brother's life?

ISABELLA

    Please you to do't,
    I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
    It is no sin at all, but charity.

ANGELO

    Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
    Were equal poise of sin and charity.

ISABELLA

    That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
    Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
    If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
    To have it added to the faults of mine,
    And nothing of your answer.

ANGELO

    Nay, but hear me.
    Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
    Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.

ISABELLA

    Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
    But graciously to know I am no better.

ANGELO

    Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
    When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
    Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
    Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
    To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
    Your brother is to die.

ISABELLA

    So.

ANGELO

    And his offence is so, as it appears,
    Accountant to the law upon that pain.

ISABELLA

    True.

ANGELO

    Admit no other way to save his life,--
    As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
    But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
    Finding yourself desired of such a person,
    Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
    Could fetch your brother from the manacles
    Of the all-building law; and that there were
    No earthly mean to save him, but that either
    You must lay down the treasures of your body
    To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
    What would you do?

ISABELLA

    As much for my poor brother as myself:
    That is, were I under the terms of death,
    The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
    And strip myself to death, as to a bed
    That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
    My body up to shame.

ANGELO

    Then must your brother die.

ISABELLA

    And 'twere the cheaper way:
    Better it were a brother died at once,
    Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
    Should die for ever.

ANGELO

    Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
    That you have slander'd so?

ISABELLA

    Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
    Are of two houses: lawful mercy
    Is nothing kin to foul redemption.

ANGELO

    You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
    And rather proved the sliding of your brother
    A merriment than a vice.

ISABELLA

    O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
    To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
    I something do excuse the thing I hate,
    For his advantage that I dearly love.

ANGELO

    We are all frail.

ISABELLA

    Else let my brother die,
    If not a feodary, but only he
    Owe and succeed thy weakness.

ANGELO

    Nay, women are frail too.

ISABELLA

    Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
    Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
    Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
    In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
    For we are soft as our complexions are,
    And credulous to false prints.

ANGELO

    I think it well:
    And from this testimony of your own sex,--
    Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
    Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
    I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
    That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
    If you be one, as you are well express'd
    By all external warrants, show it now,
    By putting on the destined livery.

ISABELLA

    I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
    Let me entreat you speak the former language.

ANGELO

    Plainly conceive, I love you.

ISABELLA

    My brother did love Juliet,
    And you tell me that he shall die for it.

ANGELO

    He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.

ISABELLA

    I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
    Which seems a little fouler than it is,
    To pluck on others.

ANGELO

    Believe me, on mine honour,
    My words express my purpose.

ISABELLA

    Ha! little honour to be much believed,
    And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
    I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
    Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
    Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
    What man thou art.

ANGELO

    Who will believe thee, Isabel?
    My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
    My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
    Will so your accusation overweigh,
    That you shall stifle in your own report
    And smell of calumny. I have begun,
    And now I give my sensual race the rein:
    Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
    Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
    That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
    By yielding up thy body to my will;
    Or else he must not only die the death,
    But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
    To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
    Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
    I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
    Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.

    Exit

ISABELLA

    To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
    Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
    That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
    Either of condemnation or approof;
    Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
    Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
    To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
    Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
    Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
    That, had he twenty heads to tender down
    On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
    Before his sister should her body stoop
    To such abhorr'd pollution.
    Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
    More than our brother is our chastity.
    I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
    And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

    Exit

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the prison.

    Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO, and Provost

DUKE VINCENTIO

    So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?

CLAUDIO

    The miserable have no other medicine
    But only hope:
    I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Be absolute for death; either death or life
    Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
    If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
    That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
    Servile to all the skyey influences,
    That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
    Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
    For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
    And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
    For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
    Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
    For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
    Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
    And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
    Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
    For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
    That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
    For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
    And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
    For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
    After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
    For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
    Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
    And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
    For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
    The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
    Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
    For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
    But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
    Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
    Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
    Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
    Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
    To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
    That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
    Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
    That makes these odds all even.

CLAUDIO

    I humbly thank you.
    To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
    And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.

ISABELLA

    [Within] What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!

Provost

    Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.

CLAUDIO

    Most holy sir, I thank you.

    Enter ISABELLA

ISABELLA

    My business is a word or two with Claudio.

Provost

    And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Provost, a word with you.

Provost

    As many as you please.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.

    Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost

CLAUDIO

    Now, sister, what's the comfort?

ISABELLA

    Why,
    As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
    Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
    Intends you for his swift ambassador,
    Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
    Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
    To-morrow you set on.

CLAUDIO

    Is there no remedy?

ISABELLA

    None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
    To cleave a heart in twain.

CLAUDIO

    But is there any?

ISABELLA

    Yes, brother, you may live:
    There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
    If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
    But fetter you till death.

CLAUDIO

    Perpetual durance?

ISABELLA

    Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
    Though all the world's vastidity you had,
    To a determined scope.

CLAUDIO

    But in what nature?

ISABELLA

    In such a one as, you consenting to't,
    Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
    And leave you naked.

CLAUDIO

    Let me know the point.

ISABELLA

    O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
    Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
    And six or seven winters more respect
    Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
    The sense of death is most in apprehension;
    And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
    In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
    As when a giant dies.

CLAUDIO

    Why give you me this shame?
    Think you I can a resolution fetch
    From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
    I will encounter darkness as a bride,
    And hug it in mine arms.

ISABELLA

    There spake my brother; there my father's grave
    Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
    Thou art too noble to conserve a life
    In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
    Whose settled visage and deliberate word
    Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
    As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
    His filth within being cast, he would appear
    A pond as deep as hell.

CLAUDIO

    The prenzie Angelo!

ISABELLA

    O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
    The damned'st body to invest and cover
    In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
    If I would yield him my virginity,
    Thou mightst be freed.

CLAUDIO

    O heavens! it cannot be.

ISABELLA

    Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
    So to offend him still. This night's the time
    That I should do what I abhor to name,
    Or else thou diest to-morrow.

CLAUDIO

    Thou shalt not do't.

ISABELLA

    O, were it but my life,
    I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
    As frankly as a pin.

CLAUDIO

    Thanks, dear Isabel.

ISABELLA

    Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.

CLAUDIO

    Yes. Has he affections in him,
    That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
    When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
    Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.

ISABELLA

    Which is the least?

CLAUDIO

    If it were damnable, he being so wise,
    Why would he for the momentary trick
    Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!

ISABELLA

    What says my brother?

CLAUDIO

    Death is a fearful thing.

ISABELLA

    And shamed life a hateful.

CLAUDIO

    Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
    To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
    This sensible warm motion to become
    A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
    To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
    In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
    To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
    And blown with restless violence round about
    The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
    Of those that lawless and incertain thought
    Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
    The weariest and most loathed worldly life
    That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
    Can lay on nature is a paradise
    To what we fear of death.

ISABELLA

    Alas, alas!

CLAUDIO

    Sweet sister, let me live:
    What sin you do to save a brother's life,
    Nature dispenses with the deed so far
    That it becomes a virtue.

ISABELLA

    O you beast!
    O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
    Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
    Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
    From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
    Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
    For such a warped slip of wilderness
    Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
    Die, perish! Might but my bending down
    Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
    I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
    No word to save thee.

CLAUDIO

    Nay, hear me, Isabel.

ISABELLA

    O, fie, fie, fie!
    Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
    Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
    'Tis best thou diest quickly.

CLAUDIO

    O hear me, Isabella!

    Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.

ISABELLA

    What is your will?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
    by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
    would require is likewise your own benefit.

ISABELLA

    I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
    stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.

    Walks apart

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
    and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
    corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
    virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
    of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
    hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
    glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
    know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
    death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
    that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
    your knees and make ready.

CLAUDIO

    Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
    with life that I will sue to be rid of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Hold you there: farewell.

    Exit CLAUDIO
    Provost, a word with you!

    Re-enter Provost

Provost

    What's your will, father

DUKE VINCENTIO

    That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
    awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
    habit no loss shall touch her by my company.

Provost

    In good time.

    Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward

DUKE VINCENTIO

    The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
    the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
    brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
    your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
    fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
    fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
    that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
    wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
    substitute, and to save your brother?

ISABELLA

    I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
    brother die by the law than my son should be
    unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
    deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
    speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
    discover his government.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
    now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
    trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
    advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
    remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
    that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
    lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
    the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
    person; and much please the absent duke, if
    peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
    this business.

ISABELLA

    Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
    anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
    you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
    Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?

ISABELLA

    I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
    to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
    which time of the contract and limit of the
    solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
    having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
    sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
    poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
    renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
    kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
    her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
    combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.

ISABELLA

    Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
    with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
    pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
    bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
    wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
    is washed with them, but relents not.

ISABELLA

    What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
    from the world! What corruption in this life, that
    it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
    cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
    you from dishonour in doing it.

ISABELLA

    Show me how, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
    of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
    in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
    like an impediment in the current, made it more
    violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
    requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
    his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
    this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
    not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
    silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
    This being granted in course,--and now follows
    all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
    your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
    acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
    her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
    saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
    advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
    will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
    think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
    of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
    What think you of it?

ISABELLA

    The image of it gives me content already; and I
    trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
    to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
    bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
    presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
    grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
    place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
    it may be quickly.

ISABELLA

    I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.

    Exeunt severally

SCENE II. The street before the prison.

    Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before; on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY

ELBOW

    Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
    needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
    shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    O heavens! what stuff is here

POMPEY

    'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
    merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
    order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and
    furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
    craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.

ELBOW

    Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    And you, good brother father. What offence hath
    this man made you, sir?

ELBOW

    Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
    take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
    upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
    sent to the deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
    The evil that thou causest to be done,
    That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
    What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
    From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
    From their abominable and beastly touches
    I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
    Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
    So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.

POMPEY

    Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
    sir, I would prove--

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
    Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
    Correction and instruction must both work
    Ere this rude beast will profit.

ELBOW

    He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
    warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
    he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
    as good go a mile on his errand.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    That we were all, as some would seem to be,
    From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!

ELBOW

    His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.

POMPEY

    I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
    friend of mine.

    Enter LUCIO

LUCIO

    How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
    Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
    none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
    had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
    extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
    sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
    not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
    thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
    the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
    trick of it?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Still thus, and thus; still worse!

LUCIO

    How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
    still, ha?

POMPEY

    Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
    is herself in the tub.

LUCIO

    Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
    so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
    an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
    to prison, Pompey?

POMPEY

    Yes, faith, sir.

LUCIO

    Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
    sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?

ELBOW

    For being a bawd, for being a bawd.

LUCIO

    Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
    due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
    doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
    Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
    Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
    will keep the house.

POMPEY

    I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.

LUCIO

    No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
    I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
    you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
    more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    And you.

LUCIO

    Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?

ELBOW

    Come your ways, sir; come.

POMPEY

    You will not bail me, then, sir?

LUCIO

    Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
    what news?

ELBOW

    Come your ways, sir; come.

LUCIO

    Go to kennel, Pompey; go.

    Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers
    What news, friar, of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I know none. Can you tell me of any?

LUCIO

    Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
    some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.

LUCIO

    It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
    the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
    to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
    puts transgression to 't.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    He does well in 't.

LUCIO

    A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
    him: something too crabbed that way, friar.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.

LUCIO

    Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
    it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
    it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
    down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
    woman after this downright way of creation: is it
    true, think you?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    How should he be made, then?

LUCIO

    Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
    was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
    certain that when he makes water his urine is
    congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
    motion generative; that's infallible.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.

LUCIO

    Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
    rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
    man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
    Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
    hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
    a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
    knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I never heard the absent duke much detected for
    women; he was not inclined that way.

LUCIO

    O, sir, you are deceived.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    'Tis not possible.

LUCIO

    Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
    his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
    duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
    that let me inform you.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    You do him wrong, surely.

LUCIO

    Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
    duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
    withdrawing.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    What, I prithee, might be the cause?

LUCIO

    No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
    teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
    understand, the greater file of the subject held the
    duke to be wise.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Wise! why, no question but he was.

LUCIO

    A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
    the very stream of his life and the business he hath
    helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
    proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
    bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
    envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
    Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
    knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.

LUCIO

    Sir, I know him, and I love him.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
    dearer love.

LUCIO

    Come, sir, I know what I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
    you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
    prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
    answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
    you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
    upon you; and, I pray you, your name?

LUCIO

    Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
    report you.

LUCIO

    I fear you not.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
    imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
    can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.

LUCIO

    I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
    friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
    Claudio die to-morrow or no?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Why should he die, sir?

LUCIO

    Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
    the duke we talk of were returned again: the
    ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
    continency; sparrows must not build in his
    house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
    yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
    never bring them to light: would he were returned!
    Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
    Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
    duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
    Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
    he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
    bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.

    Exit

DUKE VINCENTIO

    No might nor greatness in mortality
    Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
    The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
    Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
    But who comes here?

    Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE

ESCALUS

    Go; away with her to prison!

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
    a merciful man; good my lord.

ESCALUS

    Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
    the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
    the tyrant.

Provost

    A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
    your honour.

MISTRESS OVERDONE

    My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
    Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
    duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
    is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
    I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!

ESCALUS

    That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
    called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
    no more words.

    Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE
    Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
    Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
    with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
    if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
    so with him.

Provost

    So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
    advised him for the entertainment of death.

ESCALUS

    Good even, good father.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Bliss and goodness on you!

ESCALUS

    Of whence are you?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Not of this country, though my chance is now
    To use it for my time: I am a brother
    Of gracious order, late come from the See
    In special business from his holiness.

ESCALUS

    What news abroad i' the world?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    None, but that there is so great a fever on
    goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
    novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
    to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
    to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
    truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
    security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
    upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
    news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
    pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?

ESCALUS

    One that, above all other strifes, contended
    especially to know himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    What pleasure was he given to?

ESCALUS

    Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
    any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
    gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
    his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
    and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
    prepared. I am made to understand that you have
    lent him visitation.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    He professes to have received no sinister measure
    from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
    to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
    to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
    deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
    leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
    resolved to die.

ESCALUS

    You have paid the heavens your function, and the
    prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
    laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
    shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
    found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
    he is indeed Justice.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    If his own life answer the straitness of his
    proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
    chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.

ESCALUS

    I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Peace be with you!

    Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost
    He who the sword of heaven will bear
    Should be as holy as severe;
    Pattern in himself to know,
    Grace to stand, and virtue go;
    More nor less to others paying
    Than by self-offences weighing.
    Shame to him whose cruel striking
    Kills for faults of his own liking!
    Twice treble shame on Angelo,
    To weed my vice and let his grow!
    O, what may man within him hide,
    Though angel on the outward side!
    How may likeness made in crimes,
    Making practise on the times,
    To draw with idle spiders' strings
    Most ponderous and substantial things!
    Craft against vice I must apply:
    With Angelo to-night shall lie
    His old betrothed but despised;
    So disguise shall, by the disguised,
    Pay with falsehood false exacting,
    And perform an old contracting.

    Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. The moated grange at ST. LUKE's.

    Enter MARIANA and a Boy

    Boy sings

    Take, O, take those lips away,
    That so sweetly were forsworn;
    And those eyes, the break of day,
    Lights that do mislead the morn:
    But my kisses bring again, bring again;
    Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.

MARIANA

    Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:
    Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice
    Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.

    Exit Boy

    Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
    I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish
    You had not found me here so musical:
    Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
    My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
    To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
    I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
    for me here to-day? much upon this time have
    I promised here to meet.

MARIANA

    You have not been inquired after:
    I have sat here all day.

    Enter ISABELLA

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I do constantly believe you. The time is come even
    now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may
    be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.

MARIANA

    I am always bound to you.

    Exit

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Very well met, and well come.
    What is the news from this good deputy?

ISABELLA

    He hath a garden circummured with brick,
    Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
    And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
    That makes his opening with this bigger key:
    This other doth command a little door
    Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
    There have I made my promise
    Upon the heavy middle of the night
    To call upon him.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    But shall you on your knowledge find this way?

ISABELLA

    I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
    With whispering and most guilty diligence,
    In action all of precept, he did show me
    The way twice o'er.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Are there no other tokens
    Between you 'greed concerning her observance?

ISABELLA

    No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
    And that I have possess'd him my most stay
    Can be but brief; for I have made him know
    I have a servant comes with me along,
    That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
    I come about my brother.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    'Tis well borne up.
    I have not yet made known to Mariana
    A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!

    Re-enter MARIANA
    I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
    She comes to do you good.

ISABELLA

    I do desire the like.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?

MARIANA

    Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
    Who hath a story ready for your ear.
    I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
    The vaporous night approaches.

MARIANA

    Will't please you walk aside?

    Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA

DUKE VINCENTIO

    O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
    Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
    Run with these false and most contrarious quests
    Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
    Make thee the father of their idle dreams
    And rack thee in their fancies.

    Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA
    Welcome, how agreed?

ISABELLA

    She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
    If you advise it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    It is not my consent,
    But my entreaty too.

ISABELLA

    Little have you to say
    When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
    'Remember now my brother.'

MARIANA

    Fear me not.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
    He is your husband on a pre-contract:
    To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
    Sith that the justice of your title to him
    Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
    Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the prison.

    Enter Provost and POMPEY

Provost

    Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?

POMPEY

    If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
    married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
    cut off a woman's head.

Provost

    Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
    direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
    and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
    executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
    you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
    redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
    your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
    with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
    notorious bawd.

POMPEY

    Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
    but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
    would be glad to receive some instruction from my
    fellow partner.

Provost

    What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?

    Enter ABHORSON

ABHORSON

    Do you call, sir?

Provost

    Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
    your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
    him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
    not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
    cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.

ABHORSON

    A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.

Provost

    Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
    the scale.

    Exit

POMPEY

    Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
    good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
    look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?

ABHORSON

    Ay, sir; a mystery

POMPEY

    Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
    your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
    using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
    but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
    should be hanged, I cannot imagine.

ABHORSON

    Sir, it is a mystery.

POMPEY

    Proof?

ABHORSON

    Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
    too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
    big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
    thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
    apparel fits your thief.

    Re-enter Provost

Provost

    Are you agreed?

POMPEY

    Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
    a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
    oftener ask forgiveness.

Provost

    You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
    to-morrow four o'clock.

ABHORSON

    Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.

POMPEY

    I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
    occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
    me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
    a good turn.

Provost

    Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:

    Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON
    The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
    Being a murderer, though he were my brother.

    Enter CLAUDIO
    Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
    'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
    Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?

CLAUDIO

    As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
    When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
    He will not wake.

Provost

    Who can do good on him?
    Well, go, prepare yourself.

    Knocking within
    But, hark, what noise?
    Heaven give your spirits comfort!

    Exit CLAUDIO
    By and by.
    I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
    For the most gentle Claudio.

    Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before
    Welcome father.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
    Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?

Provost

    None, since the curfew rung.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Not Isabel?

Provost

    No.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    They will, then, ere't be long.

Provost

    What comfort is for Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    There's some in hope.

Provost

    It is a bitter deputy.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
    Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
    He doth with holy abstinence subdue
    That in himself which he spurs on his power
    To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
    Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
    But this being so, he's just.

    Knocking within
    Now are they come.

    Exit Provost
    This is a gentle provost: seldom when
    The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.

    Knocking within
    How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
    That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.

    Re-enter Provost

Provost

    There he must stay until the officer
    Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
    But he must die to-morrow?

Provost

    None, sir, none.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
    You shall hear more ere morning.

Provost

    Happily
    You something know; yet I believe there comes
    No countermand; no such example have we:
    Besides, upon the very siege of justice
    Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
    Profess'd the contrary.

    Enter a Messenger
    This is his lordship's man.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    And here comes Claudio's pardon.

Messenger

    [Giving a paper]
    My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this
    further charge, that you swerve not from the
    smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or
    other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,
    it is almost day.

Provost

    I shall obey him.

    Exit Messenger

DUKE VINCENTIO

    [Aside] This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
    For which the pardoner himself is in.
    Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
    When it is born in high authority:
    When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
    That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
    Now, sir, what news?

Provost

    I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
    in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
    putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Pray you, let's hear.

Provost

    [Reads]
    'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
    Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the
    afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,
    let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let
    this be duly performed; with a thought that more
    depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail
    not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
    What say you to this, sir?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
    afternoon?

Provost

    A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
    that is a prisoner nine years old.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    How came it that the absent duke had not either
    delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
    have heard it was ever his manner to do so.

Provost

    His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
    indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
    Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    It is now apparent?

Provost

    Most manifest, and not denied by himself.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
    seems he to be touched?

Provost

    A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
    as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
    of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
    mortality, and desperately mortal.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    He wants advice.

Provost

    He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
    of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
    would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
    entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
    to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
    warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
    provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
    truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
    boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
    Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
    no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
    sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
    manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
    for the which you are to do me both a present and a
    dangerous courtesy.

Provost

    Pray, sir, in what?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    In the delaying death.

Provost

    A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
    and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
    his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
    as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
    instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
    be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.

Provost

    Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
    Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
    the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
    death: you know the course is common. If any thing
    fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
    fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
    against it with my life.

Provost

    Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?

Provost

    To him, and to his substitutes.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
    avouch the justice of your dealing?

Provost

    But what likelihood is in that?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
    you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
    persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
    further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
    Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
    duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
    signet is not strange to you.

Provost

    I know them both.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
    shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
    shall find, within these two days he will be here.
    This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
    very day receives letters of strange tenor;
    perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
    into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
    is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
    shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
    things should be: all difficulties are but easy
    when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
    with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
    shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
    are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
    Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Another room in the same.

    Enter POMPEY

POMPEY

    I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
    of profession: one would think it were Mistress
    Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
    customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
    for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
    ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
    five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not
    much in request, for the old women were all dead.
    Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of
    Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
    peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
    beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
    Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
    Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
    Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
    Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
    great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
    Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in
    our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'

    Enter ABHORSON

ABHORSON

    Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.

POMPEY

    Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
    Master Barnardine!

ABHORSON

    What, ho, Barnardine!

BARNARDINE

    [Within] A pox o' your throats! Who makes that
    noise there? What are you?

POMPEY

    Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
    good, sir, to rise and be put to death.

BARNARDINE

    [Within] Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.

ABHORSON

    Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.

POMPEY

    Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
    executed, and sleep afterwards.

ABHORSON

    Go in to him, and fetch him out.

POMPEY

    He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.

ABHORSON

    Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?

POMPEY

    Very ready, sir.

    Enter BARNARDINE

BARNARDINE

    How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?

ABHORSON

    Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
    prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.

BARNARDINE

    You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
    fitted for 't.

POMPEY

    O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
    and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
    sounder all the next day.

ABHORSON

    Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
    we jest now, think you?

    Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
    you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
    you and pray with you.

BARNARDINE

    Friar, not I I have been drinking hard all night,
    and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
    shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
    consent to die this day, that's certain.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
    Look forward on the journey you shall go.

BARNARDINE

    I swear I will not die to-day for any man's
    persuasion.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    But hear you.

BARNARDINE

    Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
    come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.

    Exit

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
    After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

    Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY

    Re-enter Provost

Provost

    Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
    And to transport him in the mind he is
    Were damnable.

Provost

    Here in the prison, father,
    There died this morning of a cruel fever
    One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
    A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
    Just of his colour. What if we do omit
    This reprobate till he were well inclined;
    And satisfy the deputy with the visage
    Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
    Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
    Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
    And sent according to command; whiles I
    Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.

Provost

    This shall be done, good father, presently.
    But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
    And how shall we continue Claudio,
    To save me from the danger that might come
    If he were known alive?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Let this be done.
    Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
    Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
    To the under generation, you shall find
    Your safety manifested.

Provost

    I am your free dependant.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.

    Exit Provost
    Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
    The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
    Shall witness to him I am near at home,
    And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
    To enter publicly: him I'll desire
    To meet me at the consecrated fount
    A league below the city; and from thence,
    By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
    We shall proceed with Angelo.

    Re-enter Provost

Provost

    Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
    For I would commune with you of such things
    That want no ear but yours.

Provost

    I'll make all speed.

    Exit

ISABELLA

    [Within] Peace, ho, be here!

DUKE VINCENTIO

    The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
    If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
    But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
    To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
    When it is least expected.

    Enter ISABELLA

ISABELLA

    Ho, by your leave!

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.

ISABELLA

    The better, given me by so holy a man.
    Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
    His head is off and sent to Angelo.

ISABELLA

    Nay, but it is not so.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
    In your close patience.

ISABELLA

    O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!

DUKE VINCENTIO

    You shall not be admitted to his sight.

ISABELLA

    Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
    Injurious world! most damned Angelo!

DUKE VINCENTIO

    This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
    Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
    Mark what I say, which you shall find
    By every syllable a faithful verity:
    The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
    One of our convent, and his confessor,
    Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
    Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
    Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
    There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
    In that good path that I would wish it go,
    And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
    Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
    And general honour.

ISABELLA

    I am directed by you.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
    'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
    Say, by this token, I desire his company
    At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
    I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
    Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
    Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
    I am combined by a sacred vow
    And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
    Command these fretting waters from your eyes
    With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
    If I pervert your course. Who's here?

    Enter LUCIO

LUCIO

    Good even. Friar, where's the provost?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Not within, sir.

LUCIO

    O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
    thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
    to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
    my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
    me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
    to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
    if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
    at home, he had lived.

    Exit ISABELLA

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
    reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.

LUCIO

    Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
    he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.

LUCIO

    Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
    I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
    they be true; if not true, none were enough.

LUCIO

    I was once before him for getting a wench with child.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Did you such a thing?

LUCIO

    Yes, marry, did I but I was fain to forswear it;
    they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.

LUCIO

    By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
    if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
    it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in ANGELO's house.

    Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS

ESCALUS

    Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.

ANGELO

    In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
    show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
    not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
    redeliver our authorities there

ESCALUS

    I guess not.

ANGELO

    And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
    entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
    they should exhibit their petitions in the street?

ESCALUS

    He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
    complaints, and to deliver us from devices
    hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
    against us.

ANGELO

    Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
    i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
    notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
    him.

ESCALUS

    I shall, sir. Fare you well.

ANGELO

    Good night.

    Exit ESCALUS
    This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
    And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
    And by an eminent body that enforced
    The law against it! But that her tender shame
    Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
    How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
    For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
    That no particular scandal once can touch
    But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
    Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
    Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
    By so receiving a dishonour'd life
    With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
    A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
    Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.

    Exit

SCENE V. Fields without the town.

    Enter DUKE VINCENTIO in his own habit, and FRIAR PETER

DUKE VINCENTIO

    These letters at fit time deliver me

    Giving letters
    The provost knows our purpose and our plot.
    The matter being afoot, keep your instruction,
    And hold you ever to our special drift;
    Though sometimes you do blench from this to that,
    As cause doth minister. Go call at Flavius' house,
    And tell him where I stay: give the like notice
    To Valentinus, Rowland, and to Crassus,
    And bid them bring the trumpets to the gate;
    But send me Flavius first.

FRIAR PETER

    It shall be speeded well.

    Exit

    Enter VARRIUS

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I thank thee, Varrius; thou hast made good haste:
    Come, we will walk. There's other of our friends
    Will greet us here anon, my gentle Varrius.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Street near the city gate.

    Enter ISABELLA and MARIANA

ISABELLA

    To speak so indirectly I am loath:
    I would say the truth; but to accuse him so,
    That is your part: yet I am advised to do it;
    He says, to veil full purpose.

MARIANA

    Be ruled by him.

ISABELLA

    Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure
    He speak against me on the adverse side,
    I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic
    That's bitter to sweet end.

MARIANA

    I would Friar Peter--

ISABELLA

    O, peace! the friar is come.

    Enter FRIAR PETER

FRIAR PETER

    Come, I have found you out a stand most fit,
    Where you may have such vantage on the duke,
    He shall not pass you. Twice have the trumpets sounded;
    The generous and gravest citizens
    Have hent the gates, and very near upon
    The duke is entering: therefore, hence, away!

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. The city gate.

    MARIANA veiled, ISABELLA, and FRIAR PETER, at their stand. Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, VARRIUS, Lords, ANGELO, ESCALUS, LUCIO, Provost, Officers, and Citizens, at several doors

DUKE VINCENTIO

    My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
    Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.

ANGELO ESCALUS

    Happy return be to your royal grace!

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Many and hearty thankings to you both.
    We have made inquiry of you; and we hear
    Such goodness of your justice, that our soul
    Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
    Forerunning more requital.

ANGELO

    You make my bonds still greater.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,
    To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,
    When it deserves, with characters of brass,
    A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
    And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
    And let the subject see, to make them know
    That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
    Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
    You must walk by us on our other hand;
    And good supporters are you.

    FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward

FRIAR PETER

    Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.

ISABELLA

    Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
    Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
    O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
    By throwing it on any other object
    Till you have heard me in my true complaint
    And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
    Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
    Reveal yourself to him.

ISABELLA

    O worthy duke,
    You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
    Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
    Must either punish me, not being believed,
    Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!

ANGELO

    My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
    She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
    Cut off by course of justice,--

ISABELLA

    By course of justice!

ANGELO

    And she will speak most bitterly and strange.

ISABELLA

    Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
    That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
    That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
    That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
    An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
    Is it not strange and strange?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Nay, it is ten times strange.

ISABELLA

    It is not truer he is Angelo
    Than this is all as true as it is strange:
    Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
    To the end of reckoning.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Away with her! Poor soul,
    She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.

ISABELLA

    O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
    There is another comfort than this world,
    That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
    That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
    That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
    But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
    May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
    As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
    In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
    Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
    If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
    Had I more name for badness.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    By mine honesty,
    If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
    Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
    Such a dependency of thing on thing,
    As e'er I heard in madness.

ISABELLA

    O gracious duke,
    Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
    For inequality; but let your reason serve
    To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
    And hide the false seems true.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Many that are not mad
    Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?

ISABELLA

    I am the sister of one Claudio,
    Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
    To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
    I, in probation of a sisterhood,
    Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
    As then the messenger,--

LUCIO

    That's I, an't like your grace:
    I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
    To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
    For her poor brother's pardon.

ISABELLA

    That's he indeed.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    You were not bid to speak.

LUCIO

    No, my good lord;
    Nor wish'd to hold my peace.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I wish you now, then;
    Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
    A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
    Be perfect.

LUCIO

    I warrant your honour.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.

ISABELLA

    This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--

LUCIO

    Right.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
    To speak before your time. Proceed.

ISABELLA

    I went
    To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--

DUKE VINCENTIO

    That's somewhat madly spoken.

ISABELLA

    Pardon it;
    The phrase is to the matter.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Mended again. The matter; proceed.

ISABELLA

    In brief, to set the needless process by,
    How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
    How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
    For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
    I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
    He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
    To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
    Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
    My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
    And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
    His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
    For my poor brother's head.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    This is most likely!

ISABELLA

    O, that it were as like as it is true!

DUKE VINCENTIO

    By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
    Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
    In hateful practise. First, his integrity
    Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
    That with such vehemency he should pursue
    Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
    He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
    And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
    Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
    Thou camest here to complain.

ISABELLA

    And is this all?
    Then, O you blessed ministers above,
    Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
    Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
    In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
    As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
    To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
    A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
    On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
    Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?

ISABELLA

    One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?

LUCIO

    My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
    I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
    For certain words he spake against your grace
    In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
    And to set on this wretched woman here
    Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.

LUCIO

    But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
    I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
    A very scurvy fellow.

FRIAR PETER

    Blessed be your royal grace!
    I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
    Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
    Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
    Who is as free from touch or soil with her
    As she from one ungot.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    We did believe no less.
    Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?

FRIAR PETER

    I know him for a man divine and holy;
    Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
    As he's reported by this gentleman;
    And, on my trust, a man that never yet
    Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.

LUCIO

    My lord, most villanously; believe it.

FRIAR PETER

    Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
    But at this instant he is sick my lord,
    Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
    Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
    Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
    To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
    Is true and false; and what he with his oath
    And all probation will make up full clear,
    Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
    To justify this worthy nobleman,
    So vulgarly and personally accused,
    Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
    Till she herself confess it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Good friar, let's hear it.

    ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward
    Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
    O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
    Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
    In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
    Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
    First, let her show her face, and after speak.

MARIANA

    Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
    Until my husband bid me.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    What, are you married?

MARIANA

    No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Are you a maid?

MARIANA

    No, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    A widow, then?

MARIANA

    Neither, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?

LUCIO

    My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
    neither maid, widow, nor wife.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
    To prattle for himself.

LUCIO

    Well, my lord.

MARIANA

    My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
    And I confess besides I am no maid:
    I have known my husband; yet my husband
    Knows not that ever he knew me.

LUCIO

    He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!

LUCIO

    Well, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    This is no witness for Lord Angelo.

MARIANA

    Now I come to't my lord
    She that accuses him of fornication,
    In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
    And charges him my lord, with such a time
    When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
    With all the effect of love.

ANGELO

    Charges she more than me?

MARIANA

    Not that I know.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    No? you say your husband.

MARIANA

    Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
    Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
    But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.

ANGELO

    This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.

MARIANA

    My husband bids me; now I will unmask.

    Unveiling
    This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
    Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
    This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
    Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
    That took away the match from Isabel,
    And did supply thee at thy garden-house
    In her imagined person.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Know you this woman?

LUCIO

    Carnally, she says.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Sirrah, no more!

LUCIO

    Enough, my lord.

ANGELO

    My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
    And five years since there was some speech of marriage
    Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
    Partly for that her promised proportions
    Came short of composition, but in chief
    For that her reputation was disvalued
    In levity: since which time of five years
    I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
    Upon my faith and honour.

MARIANA

    Noble prince,
    As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
    As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
    I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
    As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
    But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
    He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
    Let me in safety raise me from my knees
    Or else for ever be confixed here,
    A marble monument!

ANGELO

    I did but smile till now:
    Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
    My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
    These poor informal women are no more
    But instruments of some more mightier member
    That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
    To find this practise out.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Ay, with my heart
    And punish them to your height of pleasure.
    Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
    Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
    Though they would swear down each particular saint,
    Were testimonies against his worth and credit
    That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
    Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
    To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
    There is another friar that set them on;
    Let him be sent for.

FRIAR PETER

    Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
    Hath set the women on to this complaint:
    Your provost knows the place where he abides
    And he may fetch him.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Go do it instantly.

    Exit Provost
    And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
    Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
    Do with your injuries as seems you best,
    In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
    But stir not you till you have well determined
    Upon these slanderers.

ESCALUS

    My lord, we'll do it throughly.

    Exit DUKE
    Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
    Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?

LUCIO

    'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
    but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
    villanous speeches of the duke.

ESCALUS

    We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
    enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
    notable fellow.

LUCIO

    As any in Vienna, on my word.

ESCALUS

    Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.

    Exit an Attendant
    Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
    shall see how I'll handle her.

LUCIO

    Not better than he, by her own report.

ESCALUS

    Say you?

LUCIO

    Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
    she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
    she'll be ashamed.

ESCALUS

    I will go darkly to work with her.

LUCIO

    That's the way; for women are light at midnight.

    Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit

ESCALUS

    Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
    that you have said.

LUCIO

    My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
    the provost.

ESCALUS

    In very good time: speak not you to him till we
    call upon you.

LUCIO

    Mum.

ESCALUS

    Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
    Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    'Tis false.

ESCALUS

    How! know you where you are?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Respect to your great place! and let the devil
    Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
    Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.

ESCALUS

    The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
    Look you speak justly.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
    Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
    Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
    Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
    Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
    And put your trial in the villain's mouth
    Which here you come to accuse.

LUCIO

    This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.

ESCALUS

    Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
    Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
    To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
    And in the witness of his proper ear,
    To call him villain? and then to glance from him
    To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
    Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
    Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
    What 'unjust'!

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Be not so hot; the duke
    Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
    Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
    Nor here provincial. My business in this state
    Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
    Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
    Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
    But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
    Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
    As much in mock as mark.

ESCALUS

    Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!

ANGELO

    What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
    Is this the man that you did tell us of?

LUCIO

    'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
    do you know me?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
    met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.

LUCIO

    O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Most notedly, sir.

LUCIO

    Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
    fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
    that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
    much more, much worse.

LUCIO

    O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
    nose for thy speeches?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I protest I love the duke as I love myself.

ANGELO

    Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
    treasonable abuses!

ESCALUS

    Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
    him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
    to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
    speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
    with the other confederate companion!

DUKE VINCENTIO

    [To Provost] Stay, sir; stay awhile.

ANGELO

    What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.

LUCIO

    Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
    bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
    you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
    show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
    Will't not off?

    Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE VINCENTIO

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
    First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.

    To LUCIO
    Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
    Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.

LUCIO

    This may prove worse than hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    [To ESCALUS] What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
    We'll borrow place of him.

    To ANGELO
    Sir, by your leave.
    Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
    That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
    Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
    And hold no longer out.

ANGELO

    O my dread lord,
    I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
    To think I can be undiscernible,
    When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
    Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
    No longer session hold upon my shame,
    But let my trial be mine own confession:
    Immediate sentence then and sequent death
    Is all the grace I beg.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Come hither, Mariana.
    Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?

ANGELO

    I was, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
    Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
    Return him here again. Go with him, provost.

    Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and Provost

ESCALUS

    My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
    Than at the strangeness of it.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Come hither, Isabel.
    Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
    Advertising and holy to your business,
    Not changing heart with habit, I am still
    Attorney'd at your service.

ISABELLA

    O, give me pardon,
    That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
    Your unknown sovereignty!

DUKE VINCENTIO

    You are pardon'd, Isabel:
    And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
    Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
    And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
    Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
    Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
    Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
    It was the swift celerity of his death,
    Which I did think with slower foot came on,
    That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
    That life is better life, past fearing death,
    Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
    So happy is your brother.

ISABELLA

    I do, my lord.

    Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and Provost

DUKE VINCENTIO

    For this new-married man approaching here,
    Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
    Your well defended honour, you must pardon
    For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
    Being criminal, in double violation
    Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
    Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
    The very mercy of the law cries out
    Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
    'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
    Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
    Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
    Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
    Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
    We do condemn thee to the very block
    Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
    Away with him!

MARIANA

    O my most gracious lord,
    I hope you will not mock me with a husband.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
    Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
    I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
    For that he knew you, might reproach your life
    And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
    Although by confiscation they are ours,
    We do instate and widow you withal,
    To buy you a better husband.

MARIANA

    O my dear lord,
    I crave no other, nor no better man.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Never crave him; we are definitive.

MARIANA

    Gentle my liege,--

    Kneeling

DUKE VINCENTIO

    You do but lose your labour.
    Away with him to death!

    To LUCIO
    Now, sir, to you.

MARIANA

    O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
    Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
    I'll lend you all my life to do you service.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Against all sense you do importune her:
    Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
    Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
    And take her hence in horror.

MARIANA

    Isabel,
    Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
    Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
    They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
    And, for the most, become much more the better
    For being a little bad: so may my husband.
    O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?

DUKE VINCENTIO

    He dies for Claudio's death.

ISABELLA

    Most bounteous sir,

    Kneeling
    Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
    As if my brother lived: I partly think
    A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
    Till he did look on me: since it is so,
    Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
    In that he did the thing for which he died:
    For Angelo,
    His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
    And must be buried but as an intent
    That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
    Intents but merely thoughts.

MARIANA

    Merely, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
    I have bethought me of another fault.
    Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
    At an unusual hour?

Provost

    It was commanded so.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Had you a special warrant for the deed?

Provost

    No, my good lord; it was by private message.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    For which I do discharge you of your office:
    Give up your keys.

Provost

    Pardon me, noble lord:
    I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
    Yet did repent me, after more advice;
    For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
    That should by private order else have died,
    I have reserved alive.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    What's he?

Provost

    His name is Barnardine.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
    Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.

    Exit Provost

ESCALUS

    I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
    As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
    Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
    And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.

ANGELO

    I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
    And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
    That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
    'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.

    Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled, and JULIET

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Which is that Barnardine?

Provost

    This, my lord.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    There was a friar told me of this man.
    Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
    That apprehends no further than this world,
    And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
    But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
    And pray thee take this mercy to provide
    For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
    I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?

Provost

    This is another prisoner that I saved.
    Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
    As like almost to Claudio as himself.

    Unmuffles CLAUDIO

DUKE VINCENTIO

    [To ISABELLA] If he be like your brother, for his sake
    Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,
    Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
    He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
    By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
    Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
    Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:
    Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
    I find an apt remission in myself;
    And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.

    To LUCIO
    You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
    One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;
    Wherein have I so deserved of you,
    That you extol me thus?

LUCIO

    'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
    trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
    had rather it would please you I might be whipt.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
    Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
    Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
    As I have heard him swear himself there's one
    Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
    And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
    Let him be whipt and hang'd.

LUCIO

    I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
    Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
    good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
    Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
    Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
    And see our pleasure herein executed.

LUCIO

    Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
    whipping, and hanging.

DUKE VINCENTIO

    Slandering a prince deserves it.

    Exit Officers with LUCIO
    She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
    Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
    I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
    Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
    There's more behind that is more gratulate.
    Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
    We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
    Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
    The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
    The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
    I have a motion much imports your good;
    Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
    What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
    So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
    What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.

The Merry Wives of Windsor

ACT I
SCENE I. Windsor. Before PAGE's house.

    Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS

SHALLOW

    Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star-
    chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John
    Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.

SLENDER

    In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace and
    'Coram.'

SHALLOW

    Ay, cousin Slender, and 'Custalourum.

SLENDER

    Ay, and 'Rato-lorum' too; and a gentleman born,
    master parson; who writes himself 'Armigero,' in any
    bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, 'Armigero.'

SHALLOW

    Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three
    hundred years.

SLENDER

    All his successors gone before him hath done't; and
    all his ancestors that come after him may: they may
    give the dozen white luces in their coat.

SHALLOW

    It is an old coat.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;
    it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to
    man, and signifies love.

SHALLOW

    The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.

SLENDER

    I may quarter, coz.

SHALLOW

    You may, by marrying.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.

SHALLOW

    Not a whit.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Yes, py'r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat,
    there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
    simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir
    John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto
    you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my
    benevolence to make atonements and compremises
    between you.

SHALLOW

    The council shall bear it; it is a riot.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is no
    fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall
    desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a
    riot; take your vizaments in that.

SHALLOW

    Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword
    should end it.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it:
    and there is also another device in my prain, which
    peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there
    is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas
    Page, which is pretty virginity.

SLENDER

    Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
    small like a woman.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as
    you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys,
    and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his
    death's-bed--Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!
    --give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years
    old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles
    and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master
    Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.

SLENDER

    Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.

SLENDER

    I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot gifts.

SHALLOW

    Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do
    despise one that is false, or as I despise one that
    is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I
    beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will
    peat the door for Master Page.

    Knocks
    What, hoa! Got pless your house here!

PAGE

    [Within] Who's there?

    Enter PAGE

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and Justice
    Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that
    peradventures shall tell you another tale, if
    matters grow to your likings.

PAGE

    I am glad to see your worships well.
    I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.

SHALLOW

    Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it
    your good heart! I wished your venison better; it
    was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?--and I
    thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.

PAGE

    Sir, I thank you.

SHALLOW

    Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.

PAGE

    I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.

SLENDER

    How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he
    was outrun on Cotsall.

PAGE

    It could not be judged, sir.

SLENDER

    You'll not confess, you'll not confess.

SHALLOW

    That he will not. 'Tis your fault, 'tis your fault;
    'tis a good dog.

PAGE

    A cur, sir.

SHALLOW

    Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog: can there be
    more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
    Falstaff here?

PAGE

    Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good
    office between you.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.

SHALLOW

    He hath wronged me, Master Page.

PAGE

    Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.

SHALLOW

    If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not that
    so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he
    hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert
    Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.

PAGE

    Here comes Sir John.

    Enter FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL

FALSTAFF

    Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?

SHALLOW

    Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and
    broke open my lodge.

FALSTAFF

    But not kissed your keeper's daughter?

SHALLOW

    Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.

FALSTAFF

    I will answer it straight; I have done all this.
    That is now answered.

SHALLOW

    The council shall know this.

FALSTAFF

    'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:
    you'll be laughed at.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.

FALSTAFF

    Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your
    head: what matter have you against me?

SLENDER

    Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;
    and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
    Nym, and Pistol.

BARDOLPH

    You Banbury cheese!

SLENDER

    Ay, it is no matter.

PISTOL

    How now, Mephostophilus!

SLENDER

    Ay, it is no matter.

NYM

    Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.

SLENDER

    Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is
    three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that
    is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is
    myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,
    lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.

PAGE

    We three, to hear it and end it between them.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-
    book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with
    as great discreetly as we can.

FALSTAFF

    Pistol!

PISTOL

    He hears with ears.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He
    hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.

FALSTAFF

    Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?

SLENDER

    Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might
    never come in mine own great chamber again else, of
    seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
    shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two
    pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.

FALSTAFF

    Is this true, Pistol?

SIR HUGH EVANS

    No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.

PISTOL

    Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,
    I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
    Word of denial in thy labras here!
    Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!

SLENDER

    By these gloves, then, 'twas he.

NYM

    Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say
    'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's
    humour on me; that is the very note of it.

SLENDER

    By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for
    though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
    drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.

FALSTAFF

    What say you, Scarlet and John?

BARDOLPH

    Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk
    himself out of his five sentences.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!

BARDOLPH

    And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and
    so conclusions passed the careires.

SLENDER

    Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no
    matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,
    but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:
    if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have
    the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.

FALSTAFF

    You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.

    Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE, following

PAGE

    Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.

    Exit ANNE PAGE

SLENDER

    O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.

PAGE

    How now, Mistress Ford!

FALSTAFF

    Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:
    by your leave, good mistress.

    Kisses her

PAGE

    Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
    hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
    we shall drink down all unkindness.

    Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS

SLENDER

    I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of
    Songs and Sonnets here.

    Enter SIMPLE
    How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait
    on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles
    about you, have you?

SIMPLE

    Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice
    Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight
    afore Michaelmas?

SHALLOW

    Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with
    you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a
    tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh
    here. Do you understand me?

SLENDER

    Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,
    I shall do that that is reason.

SHALLOW

    Nay, but understand me.

SLENDER

    So I do, sir.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will
    description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.

SLENDER

    Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray
    you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his
    country, simple though I stand here.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    But that is not the question: the question is
    concerning your marriage.

SHALLOW

    Ay, there's the point, sir.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.

SLENDER

    Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
    reasonable demands.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to
    know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers
    philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the
    mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
    good will to the maid?

SHALLOW

    Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?

SLENDER

    I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
    would do reason.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak
    possitable, if you can carry her your desires
    towards her.

SHALLOW

    That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?

SLENDER

    I will do a greater thing than that, upon your
    request, cousin, in any reason.

SHALLOW

    Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do
    is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?

SLENDER

    I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there
    be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may
    decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are
    married and have more occasion to know one another;
    I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:
    but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that
    I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in
    the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our
    meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.

SHALLOW

    Ay, I think my cousin meant well.

SLENDER

    Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!

SHALLOW

    Here comes fair Mistress Anne.

    Re-enter ANNE PAGE
    Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!

ANNE PAGE

    The dinner is on the table; my father desires your
    worships' company.

SHALLOW

    I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.

    Exeunt SHALLOW and SIR HUGH EVANS

ANNE PAGE

    Will't please your worship to come in, sir?

SLENDER

    No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.

ANNE PAGE

    The dinner attends you, sir.

SLENDER

    I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,
    sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my
    cousin Shallow.

    Exit SIMPLE
    A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his
    friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy
    yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I
    live like a poor gentleman born.

ANNE PAGE

    I may not go in without your worship: they will not
    sit till you come.

SLENDER

    I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as
    though I did.

ANNE PAGE

    I pray you, sir, walk in.

SLENDER

    I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised
    my shin th' other day with playing at sword and
    dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a
    dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot
    abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
    dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?

ANNE PAGE

    I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.

SLENDER

    I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at
    it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see
    the bear loose, are you not?

ANNE PAGE

    Ay, indeed, sir.

SLENDER

    That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen
    Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by
    the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so
    cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,
    indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored
    rough things.

    Re-enter PAGE

PAGE

    Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.

SLENDER

    I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.

PAGE

    By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.

SLENDER

    Nay, pray you, lead the way.

PAGE

    Come on, sir.

SLENDER

    Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.

ANNE PAGE

    Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.

SLENDER

    I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.
    You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which
    is the way: and there dwells one Mistress Quickly,
    which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry
    nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer, and
    his wringer.

SIMPLE

    Well, sir.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it
    is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with
    Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire
    and require her to solicit your master's desires to
    Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will
    make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn.

    Enter FALSTAFF, Host, BARDOLPH, NYM, PISTOL, and ROBIN

FALSTAFF

    Mine host of the Garter!

Host

    What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and wisely.

FALSTAFF

    Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my
    followers.

Host

    Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag; trot, trot.

FALSTAFF

    I sit at ten pounds a week.

Host

    Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar. I
    will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall
    tap: said I well, bully Hector?

FALSTAFF

    Do so, good mine host.

Host

    I have spoke; let him follow.

    To BARDOLPH
    Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word; follow.

    Exit

FALSTAFF

    Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:
    an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered
    serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.

BARDOLPH

    It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.

PISTOL

    O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?

    Exit BARDOLPH

NYM

    He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?

FALSTAFF

    I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his
    thefts were too open; his filching was like an
    unskilful singer; he kept not time.

NYM

    The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.

PISTOL

    'Convey,' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico
    for the phrase!

FALSTAFF

    Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.

PISTOL

    Why, then, let kibes ensue.

FALSTAFF

    There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift.

PISTOL

    Young ravens must have food.

FALSTAFF

    Which of you know Ford of this town?

PISTOL

    I ken the wight: he is of substance good.

FALSTAFF

    My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.

PISTOL

    Two yards, and more.

FALSTAFF

    No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two
    yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
    thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's
    wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
    she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I
    can construe the action of her familiar style; and
    the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
    rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'

PISTOL

    He hath studied her will, and translated her will,
    out of honesty into English.

NYM

    The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?

FALSTAFF

    Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
    husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.

PISTOL

    As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.

NYM

    The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.

FALSTAFF

    I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
    another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good
    eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
    oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
    foot, sometimes my portly belly.

    Then did the sun on dunghill shine.

NYM

    I thank thee for that humour.

FALSTAFF

    O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a
    greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did
    seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's
    another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she
    is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
    be cheater to them both, and they shall be
    exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
    Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou
    this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to
    Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.

PISTOL

    Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
    And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!

NYM

    I will run no base humour: here, take the
    humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.

FALSTAFF

    [To ROBIN] Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;
    Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
    Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;
    Trudge, plod away o' the hoof; seek shelter, pack!
    Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,
    French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.

    Exeunt FALSTAFF and ROBIN

PISTOL

    Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,
    And high and low beguiles the rich and poor:
    Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
    Base Phrygian Turk!

NYM

    I have operations which be humours of revenge.

PISTOL

    Wilt thou revenge?

NYM

    By welkin and her star!

PISTOL

    With wit or steel?

NYM

    With both the humours, I:
    I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.

PISTOL

    And I to Ford shall eke unfold
    How Falstaff, varlet vile,
    His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
    And his soft couch defile.

NYM

    My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to
    deal with poison; I will possess him with
    yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous:
    that is my true humour.

PISTOL

    Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second thee; troop on.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in DOCTOR CAIUS' house.

    Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, SIMPLE, and RUGBY

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the casement,
    and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor
    Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any
    body in the house, here will be an old abusing of
    God's patience and the king's English.

RUGBY

    I'll go watch.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in
    faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.

    Exit RUGBY
    An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant
    shall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, no
    tell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,
    that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish
    that way: but nobody but has his fault; but let
    that pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?

SIMPLE

    Ay, for fault of a better.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    And Master Slender's your master?

SIMPLE

    Ay, forsooth.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Does he not wear a great round beard, like a
    glover's paring-knife?

SIMPLE

    No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with a
    little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    A softly-sprighted man, is he not?

SIMPLE

    Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands
    as any is between this and his head; he hath fought
    with a warrener.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    How say you? O, I should remember him: does he not
    hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?

SIMPLE

    Yes, indeed, does he.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell
    Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your
    master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish--

    Re-enter RUGBY

RUGBY

    Out, alas! here comes my master.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    We shall all be shent. Run in here, good young man;
    go into this closet: he will not stay long.

    Shuts SIMPLE in the closet
    What, John Rugby! John! what, John, I say!
    Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt
    he be not well, that he comes not home.

    Singing
    And down, down, adown-a, & c.

    Enter DOCTOR CAIUS

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray you,
    go and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert, a box,
    a green-a box: do intend vat I speak? a green-a box.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Ay, forsooth; I'll fetch it you.

    Aside
    I am glad he went not in himself: if he had found
    the young man, he would have been horn-mad.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Fe, fe, fe, fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je
    m'en vais a la cour--la grande affaire.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Is it this, sir?

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly. Vere
    is dat knave Rugby?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    What, John Rugby! John!

RUGBY

    Here, sir!

DOCTOR CAIUS

    You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come,
    take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to the court.

RUGBY

    'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    By my trot, I tarry too long. Od's me!
    Qu'ai-j'oublie! dere is some simples in my closet,
    dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Ay me, he'll find the young man here, and be mad!

DOCTOR CAIUS

    O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villain! larron!

    Pulling SIMPLE out
    Rugby, my rapier!

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Good master, be content.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Wherefore shall I be content-a?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    The young man is an honest man.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    What shall de honest man do in my closet? dere is
    no honest man dat shall come in my closet.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth
    of it: he came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Vell.

SIMPLE

    Ay, forsooth; to desire her to--

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Peace, I pray you.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.

SIMPLE

    To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to
    speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my
    master in the way of marriage.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my
    finger in the fire, and need not.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some paper.
    Tarry you a little-a while.

    Writes

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    [Aside to SIMPLE] I am glad he is so quiet: if he
    had been thoroughly moved, you should have heard him
    so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding,
    man, I'll do you your master what good I can: and
    the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my
    master,--I may call him my master, look you, for I
    keep his house; and I wash, wring, brew, bake,
    scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds and do
    all myself,--

SIMPLE

    [Aside to MISTRESS QUICKLY] 'Tis a great charge to
    come under one body's hand.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    [Aside to SIMPLE] Are you avised o' that? you
    shall find it a great charge: and to be up early
    and down late; but notwithstanding,--to tell you in
    your ear; I would have no words of it,--my master
    himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page: but
    notwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind,--that's
    neither here nor there.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    You jack'nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by
    gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in dee
    park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest
    to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good
    you tarry here. By gar, I will cut all his two
    stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw
    at his dog:

    Exit SIMPLE

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Alas, he speaks but for his friend.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    It is no matter-a ver dat: do not you tell-a me
    dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I
    vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine
    host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I
    will myself have Anne Page.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We
    must give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer!

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have
    not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my
    door. Follow my heels, Rugby.

    Exeunt DOCTOR CAIUS and RUGBY

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    You shall have An fool's-head of your own. No, I
    know Anne's mind for that: never a woman in Windsor
    knows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can do more
    than I do with her, I thank heaven.

FENTON

    [Within] Who's within there? ho!

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Who's there, I trow! Come near the house, I pray you.

    Enter FENTON

FENTON

    How now, good woman? how dost thou?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.

FENTON

    What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and
    gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you
    that by the way; I praise heaven for it.

FENTON

    Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not lose my suit?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but
    notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a
    book, she loves you. Have not your worship a wart
    above your eye?

FENTON

    Yes, marry, have I; what of that?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such
    another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever
    broke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I
    shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But
    indeed she is given too much to allicholy and
    musing: but for you--well, go to.

FENTON

    Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money
    for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if
    thou seest her before me, commend me.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Will I? i'faith, that we will; and I will tell your
    worship more of the wart the next time we have
    confidence; and of other wooers.

FENTON

    Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Farewell to your worship.

    Exit FENTON
    Truly, an honest gentleman: but Anne loves him not;
    for I know Anne's mind as well as another does. Out
    upon't! what have I forgot?

    Exit

ACT II
SCENE I. Before PAGE'S house.

    Enter MISTRESS PAGE, with a letter

MISTRESS PAGE

    What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-
    time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?
    Let me see.

    Reads
    'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though
    Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him
    not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more
    am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,
    so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you
    love sack, and so do I; would you desire better
    sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,--at
    the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,--
    that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis
    not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,
    Thine own true knight,
    By day or night,
    Or any kind of light,
    With all his might
    For thee to fight, JOHN FALSTAFF'
    What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked
    world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
    age to show himself a young gallant! What an
    unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard
    picked--with the devil's name!--out of my
    conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?
    Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What
    should I say to him? I was then frugal of my
    mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill
    in the parliament for the putting down of men. How
    shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,
    as sure as his guts are made of puddings.

    Enter MISTRESS FORD

MISTRESS FORD

    Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.

MISTRESS PAGE

    And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very
    ill.

MISTRESS FORD

    Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Faith, but you do, in my mind.

MISTRESS FORD

    Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the
    contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!

MISTRESS PAGE

    What's the matter, woman?

MISTRESS FORD

    O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I
    could come to such honour!

MISTRESS PAGE

    Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is
    it? dispense with trifles; what is it?

MISTRESS FORD

    If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,
    I could be knighted.

MISTRESS PAGE

    What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights
    will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the
    article of thy gentry.

MISTRESS FORD

    We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I
    might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat
    men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of
    men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
    women's modesty; and gave such orderly and
    well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I
    would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
    the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere
    and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to
    the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,
    threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his
    belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged
    on him? I think the best way were to entertain him
    with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted
    him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and
    Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery
    of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy
    letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I
    protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a
    thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for
    different names--sure, more,--and these are of the
    second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;
    for he cares not what he puts into the press, when
    he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,
    and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you
    twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.

MISTRESS FORD

    Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very
    words. What doth he think of us?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to
    wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain
    myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;
    for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I
    know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.

MISTRESS FORD

    'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him
    above deck.

MISTRESS PAGE

    So will I if he come under my hatches, I'll never
    to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's
    appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in
    his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,
    till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.

MISTRESS FORD

    Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,
    that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,
    that my husband saw this letter! it would give
    eternal food to his jealousy.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's
    as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;
    and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.

MISTRESS FORD

    You are the happier woman.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Let's consult together against this greasy knight.
    Come hither.

    They retire

    Enter FORD with PISTOL, and PAGE with NYM

FORD

    Well, I hope it be not so.

PISTOL

    Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:
    Sir John affects thy wife.

FORD

    Why, sir, my wife is not young.

PISTOL

    He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,
    Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
    He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.

FORD

    Love my wife!

PISTOL

    With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,
    Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:
    O, odious is the name!

FORD

    What name, sir?

PISTOL

    The horn, I say. Farewell.
    Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night:
    Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.
    Away, Sir Corporal Nym!
    Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.

    Exit

FORD

    [Aside] I will be patient; I will find out this.

NYM

    [To PAGE] And this is true; I like not the humour
    of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours: I
    should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I
    have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity.
    He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.
    My name is Corporal Nym; I speak and I avouch; 'tis
    true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife.
    Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese,
    and there's the humour of it. Adieu.

    Exit

PAGE

    'The humour of it,' quoth a'! here's a fellow
    frights English out of his wits.

FORD

    I will seek out Falstaff.

PAGE

    I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.

FORD

    If I do find it: well.

PAGE

    I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest
    o' the town commended him for a true man.

FORD

    'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.

PAGE

    How now, Meg!

    MISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD come forward

MISTRESS PAGE

    Whither go you, George? Hark you.

MISTRESS FORD

    How now, sweet Frank! why art thou melancholy?

FORD

    I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.

MISTRESS FORD

    Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,
    will you go, Mistress Page?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George.

    Aside to MISTRESS FORD
    Look who comes yonder: she shall be our messenger
    to this paltry knight.

MISTRESS FORD

    [Aside to MISTRESS PAGE] Trust me, I thought on her:
    she'll fit it.

    Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY

MISTRESS PAGE

    You are come to see my daughter Anne?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Go in with us and see: we have an hour's talk with
    you.

    Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and MISTRESS QUICKLY

PAGE

    How now, Master Ford!

FORD

    You heard what this knave told me, did you not?

PAGE

    Yes: and you heard what the other told me?

FORD

    Do you think there is truth in them?

PAGE

    Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would
    offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent
    towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men;
    very rogues, now they be out of service.

FORD

    Were they his men?

PAGE

    Marry, were they.

FORD

    I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at
    the Garter?

PAGE

    Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage
    towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and
    what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it
    lie on my head.

FORD

    I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to
    turn them together. A man may be too confident: I
    would have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus satisfied.

PAGE

    Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes:
    there is either liquor in his pate or money in his
    purse when he looks so merrily.

    Enter Host
    How now, mine host!

Host

    How now, bully-rook! thou'rt a gentleman.
    Cavaleiro-justice, I say!

    Enter SHALLOW

SHALLOW

    I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and
    twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go
    with us? we have sport in hand.

Host

    Tell him, cavaleiro-justice; tell him, bully-rook.

SHALLOW

    Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh
    the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.

FORD

    Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.

    Drawing him aside

Host

    What sayest thou, my bully-rook?

SHALLOW

    [To PAGE] Will you go with us to behold it? My
    merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons;
    and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places;
    for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester.
    Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.

    They converse apart

Host

    Hast thou no suit against my knight, my
    guest-cavaleire?

FORD

    None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of
    burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him
    my name is Brook; only for a jest.

Host

    My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress;
    --said I well?--and thy name shall be Brook. It is
    a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires?

SHALLOW

    Have with you, mine host.

PAGE

    I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in
    his rapier.

SHALLOW

    Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times
    you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and
    I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis
    here, 'tis here. I have seen the time, with my long
    sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.

Host

    Here, boys, here, here! shall we wag?

PAGE

    Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight.

    Exeunt Host, SHALLOW, and PAGE

FORD

    Though Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly
    on his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my
    opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's
    house; and what they made there, I know not. Well,
    I will look further into't: and I have a disguise
    to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not
    my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.

    Exit

SCENE II. A room in the Garter Inn.

    Enter FALSTAFF and PISTOL

FALSTAFF

    I will not lend thee a penny.

PISTOL

    Why, then the world's mine oyster.
    Which I with sword will open.

FALSTAFF

    Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should
    lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my
    good friends for three reprieves for you and your
    coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through
    the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in
    hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were
    good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress
    Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon
    mine honour thou hadst it not.

PISTOL

    Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?

FALSTAFF

    Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
    endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more
    about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife
    and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.
    You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you
    stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable
    baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the
    terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself
    sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand
    and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to
    shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,
    will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain
    looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your
    bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your
    honour! You will not do it, you!

PISTOL

    I do relent: what would thou more of man?

    Enter ROBIN

ROBIN

    Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.

FALSTAFF

    Let her approach.

    Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Give your worship good morrow.

FALSTAFF

    Good morrow, good wife.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Not so, an't please your worship.

FALSTAFF

    Good maid, then.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    I'll be sworn,
    As my mother was, the first hour I was born.

FALSTAFF

    I do believe the swearer. What with me?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?

FALSTAFF

    Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee
    the hearing.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come a
    little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with master
    Doctor Caius,--

FALSTAFF

    Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,
    come a little nearer this ways.

FALSTAFF

    I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine
    own people.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Are they so? God bless them and make them his servants!

FALSTAFF

    Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your
    worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all
    of us, I pray!

FALSTAFF

    Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you
    have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis
    wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the
    court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her
    to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and
    lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant
    you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift
    after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
    rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in
    such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of
    the best and the fairest, that would have won any
    woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never
    get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels
    given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in
    any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
    honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
    her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
    them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which
    is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.

FALSTAFF

    But what says she to me? be brief, my good
    she-Mercury.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which
    she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you
    to notify that her husband will be absence from his
    house between ten and eleven.

FALSTAFF

    Ten and eleven?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the
    picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,
    her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet
    woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very
    jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with
    him, good heart.

FALSTAFF

    Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will
    not fail her.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to
    your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty
    commendations to you too: and let me tell you in
    your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and
    one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor
    evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the
    other: and she bade me tell your worship that her
    husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there
    will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon
    a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.

FALSTAFF

    Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my
    good parts aside I have no other charms.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Blessing on your heart for't!

FALSTAFF

    But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and
    Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    That were a jest indeed! they have not so little
    grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
    Mistress Page would desire you to send her your
    little page, of all loves: her husband has a
    marvellous infection to the little page; and truly
    Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in
    Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what
    she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go
    to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as
    she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there
    be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must
    send her your page; no remedy.

FALSTAFF

    Why, I will.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and
    go between you both; and in any case have a
    nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and
    the boy never need to understand any thing; for
    'tis not good that children should know any
    wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,
    as they say, and know the world.

FALSTAFF

    Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's
    my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with
    this woman.

    Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY and ROBIN
    This news distracts me!

PISTOL

    This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:
    Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
    Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!

    Exit

FALSTAFF

    Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
    more of thy old body than I have done. Will they
    yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense
    of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I
    thank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it be
    fairly done, no matter.

    Enter BARDOLPH

BARDOLPH

    Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain
    speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
    sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.

FALSTAFF

    Brook is his name?

BARDOLPH

    Ay, sir.

FALSTAFF

    Call him in.

    Exit BARDOLPH
    Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such
    liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page
    have I encompassed you? go to; via!

    Re-enter BARDOLPH, with FORD disguised

FORD

    Bless you, sir!

FALSTAFF

    And you, sir! Would you speak with me?

FORD

    I make bold to press with so little preparation upon
    you.

FALSTAFF

    You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.

    Exit BARDOLPH

FORD

    Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.

FALSTAFF

    Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.

FORD

    Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;
    for I must let you understand I think myself in
    better plight for a lender than you are: the which
    hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned
    intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all
    ways do lie open.

FALSTAFF

    Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.

FORD

    Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:
    if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or
    half, for easing me of the carriage.

FALSTAFF

    Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.

FORD

    I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.

FALSTAFF

    Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be
    your servant.

FORD

    Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief
    with you,--and you have been a man long known to me,
    though I had never so good means, as desire, to make
    myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a
    thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine
    own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have
    one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,
    turn another into the register of your own; that I
    may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
    yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.

FALSTAFF

    Very well, sir; proceed.

FORD

    There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's
    name is Ford.

FALSTAFF

    Well, sir.

FORD

    I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,
    bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting
    observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;
    fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
    give me sight of her; not only bought many presents
    to give her, but have given largely to many to know
    what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued
    her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the
    wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have
    merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,
    I am sure, I have received none; unless experience
    be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite
    rate, and that hath taught me to say this:
    'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;
    Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'

FALSTAFF

    Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?

FORD

    Never.

FALSTAFF

    Have you importuned her to such a purpose?

FORD

    Never.

FALSTAFF

    Of what quality was your love, then?

FORD

    Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so
    that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
    where I erected it.

FALSTAFF

    To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?

FORD

    When I have told you that, I have told you all.
    Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in
    other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
    there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir
    John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a
    gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable
    discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your
    place and person, generally allowed for your many
    war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.

FALSTAFF

    O, sir!

FORD

    Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend
    it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only
    give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as
    to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
    Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to
    consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as
    any.

FALSTAFF

    Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
    affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
    Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.

FORD

    O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on
    the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my
    soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to
    be looked against. Now, could I could come to her
    with any detection in my hand, my desires had
    instance and argument to commend themselves: I
    could drive her then from the ward of her purity,
    her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
    other her defences, which now are too too strongly
    embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?

FALSTAFF

    Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
    money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a
    gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.

FORD

    O good sir!

FALSTAFF

    I say you shall.

FORD

    Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.

FALSTAFF

    Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want
    none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
    own appointment; even as you came in to me, her
    assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
    shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at
    that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
    will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall
    know how I speed.

FORD

    I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,
    sir?

FALSTAFF

    Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:
    yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
    jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the
    which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
    use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;
    and there's my harvest-home.

FORD

    I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him
    if you saw him.

FALSTAFF

    Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
    stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my
    cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the
    cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
    will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
    lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
    Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;
    thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and
    cuckold. Come to me soon at night.

    Exit

FORD

    What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
    ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
    improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the
    hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man
    have thought this? See the hell of having a false
    woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers
    ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not
    only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under
    the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that
    does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
    well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are
    devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
    Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath
    not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he
    will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will
    rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh
    the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my
    aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling
    gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,
    then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they
    think in their hearts they may effect, they will
    break their hearts but they will effect. God be
    praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.
    I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on
    Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;
    better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
    Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!

    seven, two, tree hours for him, and he is no come.

SHALLOW

    He is the wiser man, master doctor: he is a curer of
    souls, and you a curer of bodies; if you should
    fight, you go against the hair of your professions.
    Is it not true, Master Page?

PAGE

    Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great
    fighter, though now a man of peace.

SHALLOW

    Bodykins, Master Page, though I now be old and of
    the peace, if I see a sword out, my finger itches to
    make one. Though we are justices and doctors and
    churchmen, Master Page, we have some salt of our
    youth in us; we are the sons of women, Master Page.

PAGE

    'Tis true, Master Shallow.

SHALLOW

    It will be found so, Master Page. Master Doctor
    Caius, I am come to fetch you home. I am sworn of
    the peace: you have showed yourself a wise
    physician, and Sir Hugh hath shown himself a wise
    and patient churchman. You must go with me, master doctor.

    wide of his own respect.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    What is he?

PAGE

    I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius, the
    renowned French physician.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Got's will, and his passion of my heart! I had as
    lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.

PAGE

    Why?

SIR HUGH EVANS

    He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and Galen,

    Peace, I say! hear mine host of the Garter. Am I
    politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I
    lose my doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the
    motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir
    Hugh? no; he gives me the proverbs and the
    no-verbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so. Give me
    thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have
    deceived you both; I have directed you to wrong
    places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are

    scall, scurvy cogging companion, the host of the Garter.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    By gar, with all my heart. He promise to bring me
    where is Anne Page; by gar, he deceive me too.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Well, I will smite his noddles. Pray you, follow.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A street.

    Enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN

MISTRESS PAGE

    Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to
    be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether
    had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?

ROBIN

    I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man
    than follow him like a dwarf.

MISTRESS PAGE

    O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you'll be a courtier.

    Enter FORD

FORD

    Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?

FORD

    Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want
    of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,
    you two would marry.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Be sure of that,--two other husbands.

FORD

    Where had you this pretty weather-cock?

MISTRESS PAGE

    I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my
    husband had him of. What do you call your knight's
    name, sirrah?

ROBIN

    Sir John Falstaff.

FORD

    Sir John Falstaff!

MISTRESS PAGE

    He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such a
    league between my good man and he! Is your wife at
    home indeed?

FORD

    Indeed she is.

MISTRESS PAGE

    By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her.

    Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN

FORD

    Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he any
    thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.
    Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as
    easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve
    score. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he
    gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's
    going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A
    man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And
    Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;
    and our revolted wives share damnation together.
    Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck
    the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming
    Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and
    wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all
    my neighbours shall cry aim.

    Clock heard
    The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me
    search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be
    rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as
    positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is
    there: I will go.

    Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, SLENDER, Host, SIR HUGH EVANS, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY

SHALLOW PAGE & C

    Well met, Master Ford.

FORD

    Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;
    and I pray you all go with me.

SHALLOW

    I must excuse myself, Master Ford.

SLENDER

    And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with
    Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for
    more money than I'll speak of.

SHALLOW

    We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and
    my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.

SLENDER

    I hope I have your good will, father Page.

PAGE

    You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:
    but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-a
    Quickly tell me so mush.

Host

    What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he
    dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he
    speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will
    carry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; he
    will carry't.

PAGE

    Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is
    of no having: he kept company with the wild prince
    and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too
    much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes
    with the finger of my substance: if he take her,
    let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on
    my consent, and my consent goes not that way.

FORD

    I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me
    to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have
    sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,
    you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.

SHALLOW

    Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer wooing
    at Master Page's.

    Exeunt SHALLOW, and SLENDER

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.

    Exit RUGBY

Host

    Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest knight
    Falstaff, and drink canary with him.

    Exit

FORD

    [Aside] I think I shall drink in pipe wine first
    with him; I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?

All

    Have with you to see this monster.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in FORD'S house.

    Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE

MISTRESS FORD

    What, John! What, Robert!

MISTRESS PAGE

    Quickly, quickly! is the buck-basket--

MISTRESS FORD

    I warrant. What, Robin, I say!

    Enter Servants with a basket

MISTRESS PAGE

    Come, come, come.

MISTRESS FORD

    Here, set it down.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Give your men the charge; we must be brief.

MISTRESS FORD

    Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be
    ready here hard by in the brew-house: and when I
    suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause
    or staggering take this basket on your shoulders:
    that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry
    it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there
    empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.

MISTRESS PAGE

    You will do it?

MISTRESS FORD

    I ha' told them over and over; they lack no
    direction. Be gone, and come when you are called.

    Exeunt Servants

MISTRESS PAGE

    Here comes little Robin.

    Enter ROBIN

MISTRESS FORD

    How now, my eyas-musket! what news with you?

ROBIN

    My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door,
    Mistress Ford, and requests your company.

MISTRESS PAGE

    You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?

ROBIN

    Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your
    being here and hath threatened to put me into
    everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he
    swears he'll turn me away.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall be
    a tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doublet
    and hose. I'll go hide me.

MISTRESS FORD

    Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.

    Exit ROBIN
    Mistress Page, remember you your cue.

MISTRESS PAGE

    I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.

    Exit

MISTRESS FORD

    Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,
    this gross watery pumpion; we'll teach him to know
    turtles from jays.

    Enter FALSTAFF

FALSTAFF

    Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let
    me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the
    period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!

MISTRESS FORD

    O sweet Sir John!

FALSTAFF

    Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,
    Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would
    thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the
    best lord; I would make thee my lady.

MISTRESS FORD

    I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful lady!

FALSTAFF

    Let the court of France show me such another. I see
    how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast
    the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the
    ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of
    Venetian admittance.

MISTRESS FORD

    A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing
    else; nor that well neither.

FALSTAFF

    By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou
    wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm
    fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion
    to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see
    what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature
    thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.

MISTRESS FORD

    Believe me, there is no such thing in me.

FALSTAFF

    What made me love thee? let that persuade thee
    there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I
    cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a
    many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like
    women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury
    in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none
    but thee; and thou deservest it.

MISTRESS FORD

    Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page.

FALSTAFF

    Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the
    Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek
    of a lime-kiln.

MISTRESS FORD

    Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one
    day find it.

FALSTAFF

    Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.

MISTRESS FORD

    Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not
    be in that mind.

ROBIN

    [Within] Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's
    Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and
    looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.

FALSTAFF

    She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.

MISTRESS FORD

    Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.

    FALSTAFF hides himself

    Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN
    What's the matter? how now!

MISTRESS PAGE

    O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
    you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!

MISTRESS FORD

    What's the matter, good Mistress Page?

MISTRESS PAGE

    O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man
    to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!

MISTRESS FORD

    What cause of suspicion?

MISTRESS PAGE

    What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I
    mistook in you!

MISTRESS FORD

    Why, alas, what's the matter?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the
    officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that
    he says is here now in the house by your consent, to
    take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.

MISTRESS FORD

    'Tis not so, I hope.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man
    here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,
    with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a
    one. I come before to tell you. If you know
    yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you
    have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not
    amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your
    reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.

MISTRESS FORD

    What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear
    friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his
    peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were
    out of the house.

MISTRESS PAGE

    For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you
    had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink
    you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot
    hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here
    is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he
    may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as
    if it were going to bucking: or--it is whiting-time
    --send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.

MISTRESS FORD

    He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?

FALSTAFF

    [Coming forward] Let me see't, let me see't, O, let
    me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
    counsel. I'll in.

MISTRESS PAGE

    What, Sir John Falstaff! Are these your letters, knight?

FALSTAFF

    I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here.
    I'll never--

    Gets into the basket; they cover him with foul linen

MISTRESS PAGE

    Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men,
    Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!

MISTRESS FORD

    What, John! Robert! John!

    Exit ROBIN

    Re-enter Servants
    Go take up these clothes here quickly. Where's the
    cowl-staff? look, how you drumble! Carry them to
    the laundress in Datchet-meat; quickly, come.

    Enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS

FORD

    Pray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,
    why then make sport at me; then let me be your jest;
    I deserve it. How now! whither bear you this?

Servant

    To the laundress, forsooth.

MISTRESS FORD

    Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You
    were best meddle with buck-washing.

FORD

    Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!
    Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;
    and of the season too, it shall appear.

    Exeunt Servants with the basket
    Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my
    dream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my
    chambers; search, seek, find out: I'll warrant
    we'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.

    Locking the door
    So, now uncape.

PAGE

    Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.

FORD

    True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen: you shall see
    sport anon: follow me, gentlemen.

    Exit

SIR HUGH EVANS

    This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not
    jealous in France.

PAGE

    Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.

    Exeunt PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS

MISTRESS PAGE

    Is there not a double excellency in this?

MISTRESS FORD

    I know not which pleases me better, that my husband
    is deceived, or Sir John.

MISTRESS PAGE

    What a taking was he in when your husband asked who
    was in the basket!

MISTRESS FORD

    I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so
    throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same
    strain were in the same distress.

MISTRESS FORD

    I think my husband hath some special suspicion of
    Falstaff's being here; for I never saw him so gross
    in his jealousy till now.

MISTRESS PAGE

    I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have
    more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will
    scarce obey this medicine.

MISTRESS FORD

    Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress
    Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the
    water; and give him another hope, to betray him to
    another punishment?

MISTRESS PAGE

    We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow,
    eight o'clock, to have amends.

    Re-enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS

FORD

    I cannot find him: may be the knave bragged of that
    he could not compass.

MISTRESS PAGE

    [Aside to MISTRESS FORD] Heard you that?

MISTRESS FORD

    You use me well, Master Ford, do you?

FORD

    Ay, I do so.

MISTRESS FORD

    Heaven make you better than your thoughts!

FORD

    Amen!

MISTRESS PAGE

    You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.

FORD

    Ay, ay; I must bear it.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    If there be any pody in the house, and in the
    chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,
    heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!

DOCTOR CAIUS

    By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.

PAGE

    Fie, fie, Master Ford! are you not ashamed? What
    spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I
    would not ha' your distemper in this kind for the
    wealth of Windsor Castle.

FORD

    'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is as
    honest a 'omans as I will desires among five
    thousand, and five hundred too.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.

FORD

    Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in
    the Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereafter
    make known to you why I have done this. Come,
    wife; come, Mistress Page. I pray you, pardon me;
    pray heartily, pardon me.

PAGE

    Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock
    him. I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house
    to breakfast: after, we'll a-birding together; I
    have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?

FORD

    Any thing.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    If there is one, I shall make two in the company.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    If dere be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.

FORD

    Pray you, go, Master Page.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy
    knave, mine host.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart!

SIR HUGH EVANS

    A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in PAGE'S house.

    Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE

FENTON

    I see I cannot get thy father's love;
    Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.

ANNE PAGE

    Alas, how then?

FENTON

    Why, thou must be thyself.
    He doth object I am too great of birth--,
    And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
    I seek to heal it only by his wealth:
    Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
    My riots past, my wild societies;
    And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
    I should love thee but as a property.

ANNE PAGE

    May be he tells you true.

FENTON

    No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
    Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
    Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:
    Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
    Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;
    And 'tis the very riches of thyself
    That now I aim at.

ANNE PAGE

    Gentle Master Fenton,
    Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir:
    If opportunity and humblest suit
    Cannot attain it, why, then,--hark you hither!

    They converse apart

    Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and MISTRESS QUICKLY

SHALLOW

    Break their talk, Mistress Quickly: my kinsman shall
    speak for himself.

SLENDER

    I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't: 'slid, 'tis but
    venturing.

SHALLOW

    Be not dismayed.

SLENDER

    No, she shall not dismay me: I care not for that,
    but that I am afeard.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Hark ye; Master Slender would speak a word with you.

ANNE PAGE

    I come to him.

    Aside
    This is my father's choice.
    O, what a world of vile ill-favor'd faults
    Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.

SHALLOW

    She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!

SLENDER

    I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you
    good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress
    Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of
    a pen, good uncle.

SHALLOW

    Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.

SLENDER

    Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in
    Gloucestershire.

SHALLOW

    He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.

SLENDER

    Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the
    degree of a squire.

SHALLOW

    He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.

ANNE PAGE

    Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.

SHALLOW

    Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good
    comfort. She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.

ANNE PAGE

    Now, Master Slender,--

SLENDER

    Now, good Mistress Anne,--

ANNE PAGE

    What is your will?

SLENDER

    My will! 'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest
    indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I
    am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.

ANNE PAGE

    I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?

SLENDER

    Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing
    with you. Your father and my uncle hath made
    motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be
    his dole! They can tell you how things go better
    than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes.

    Enter PAGE and MISTRESS PAGE

PAGE

    Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
    Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here?
    You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
    I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.

FENTON

    Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.

PAGE

    She is no match for you.

FENTON

    Sir, will you hear me?

PAGE

    No, good Master Fenton.
    Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
    Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.

    Exeunt PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Speak to Mistress Page.

FENTON

    Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
    In such a righteous fashion as I do,
    Perforce, against all cheques, rebukes and manners,
    I must advance the colours of my love
    And not retire: let me have your good will.

ANNE PAGE

    Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.

MISTRESS PAGE

    I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    That's my master, master doctor.

ANNE PAGE

    Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth
    And bowl'd to death with turnips!

MISTRESS PAGE

    Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,
    I will not be your friend nor enemy:
    My daughter will I question how she loves you,
    And as I find her, so am I affected.
    Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in;
    Her father will be angry.

FENTON

    Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.

    Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ANNE PAGE

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    This is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you cast
    away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on
    Master Fenton:' this is my doing.

FENTON

    I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
    Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Now heaven send thee good fortune!

    Exit FENTON
    A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through
    fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I
    would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would
    Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master
    Fenton had her; I will do what I can for them all
    three; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good
    as my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,
    I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from
    my two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!

    Exit

SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn.

    Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH

FALSTAFF

    Bardolph, I say,--

BARDOLPH

    Here, sir.

FALSTAFF

    Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.

    Exit BARDOLPH
    Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a
    barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the
    Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,
    I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give
    them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues
    slighted me into the river with as little remorse as
    they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,
    fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size
    that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the
    bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had
    been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and
    shallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swells
    a man; and what a thing should I have been when I
    had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.

    Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack

BARDOLPH

    Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.

FALSTAFF

    Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my
    belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for
    pills to cool the reins. Call her in.

BARDOLPH

    Come in, woman!

    Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship
    good morrow.

FALSTAFF

    Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of
    sack finely.

BARDOLPH

    With eggs, sir?

FALSTAFF

    Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.

    Exit BARDOLPH
    How now!

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.

FALSTAFF

    Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown
    into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:
    she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.

FALSTAFF

    So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn
    your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning
    a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her
    between eight and nine: I must carry her word
    quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.

FALSTAFF

    Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her
    think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,
    and then judge of my merit.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    I will tell her.

FALSTAFF

    Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Eight and nine, sir.

FALSTAFF

    Well, be gone: I will not miss her.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Peace be with you, sir.

    Exit

FALSTAFF

    I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word
    to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.

    Enter FORD

FORD

    Bless you, sir!

FALSTAFF

    Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed
    between me and Ford's wife?

FORD

    That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.

FALSTAFF

    Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her
    house the hour she appointed me.

FORD

    And sped you, sir?

FALSTAFF

    Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.

FORD

    How so, sir? Did she change her determination?

FALSTAFF

    No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her
    husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual
    'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our
    encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
    and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;
    and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
    provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
    forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.

FORD

    What, while you were there?

FALSTAFF

    While I was there.

FORD

    And did he search for you, and could not find you?

FALSTAFF

    You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
    in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's
    approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's
    distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.

FORD

    A buck-basket!

FALSTAFF

    By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul
    shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
    napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest
    compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.

FORD

    And how long lay you there?

FALSTAFF

    Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have
    suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
    Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's
    knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
    mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
    Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
    the jealous knave their master in the door, who
    asked them once or twice what they had in their
    basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
    would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
    should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
    for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
    mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
    of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
    fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
    bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
    bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
    point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
    like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
    that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a
    man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject
    to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
    and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
    And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
    half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
    thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
    in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
    that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.

FORD

    In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you
    have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;
    you'll undertake her no more?

FALSTAFF

    Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have
    been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
    husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have
    received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt
    eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.

FORD

    'Tis past eight already, sir.

FALSTAFF

    Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.
    Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall
    know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be
    crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
    have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall
    cuckold Ford.

    Exit

FORD

    Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I
    sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!
    there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.
    This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen
    and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself
    what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my
    house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he
    should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,
    nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that
    guides him should aid him, I will search
    impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,
    yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:
    if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go
    with me: I'll be horn-mad.

    Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. A street.

    Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS QUICKLY, and WILLIAM PAGE

MISTRESS PAGE

    Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Sure he is by this, or will be presently: but,
    truly, he is very courageous mad about his throwing
    into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.

MISTRESS PAGE

    I'll be with her by and by; I'll but bring my young
    man here to school. Look, where his master comes;
    'tis a playing-day, I see.

    Enter SIR HUGH EVANS
    How now, Sir Hugh! no school to-day?

SIR HUGH EVANS

    No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Blessing of his heart!

MISTRESS PAGE

    Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in
    the world at his book. I pray you, ask him some
    questions in his accidence.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your
    master, be not afraid.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    William, how many numbers is in nouns?

WILLIAM PAGE

    Two.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Truly, I thought there had been one number more,
    because they say, ''Od's nouns.'

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Peace your tattlings! What is 'fair,' William?

WILLIAM PAGE

    Pulcher.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Polecats! there are fairer things than polecats, sure.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    You are a very simplicity 'oman: I pray you peace.
    What is 'lapis,' William?

WILLIAM PAGE

    A stone.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    And what is 'a stone,' William?

WILLIAM PAGE

    A pebble.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    No, it is 'lapis:' I pray you, remember in your prain.

WILLIAM PAGE

    Lapis.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    That is a good William. What is he, William, that
    does lend articles?

WILLIAM PAGE

    Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus
    declined, Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark:
    genitivo, hujus. Well, what is your accusative case?

WILLIAM PAGE

    Accusativo, hinc.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    I pray you, have your remembrance, child,
    accusative, hung, hang, hog.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Leave your prabbles, 'oman. What is the focative
    case, William?

WILLIAM PAGE

    O,--vocativo, O.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Remember, William; focative is caret.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    And that's a good root.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    'Oman, forbear.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Peace!

SIR HUGH EVANS

    What is your genitive case plural, William?

WILLIAM PAGE

    Genitive case!

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Ay.

WILLIAM PAGE

    Genitive,--horum, harum, horum.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Vengeance of Jenny's case! fie on her! never name
    her, child, if she be a whore.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    For shame, 'oman.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    You do ill to teach the child such words: he
    teaches him to hick and to hack, which they'll do
    fast enough of themselves, and to call 'horum:' fie upon you!

SIR HUGH EVANS

    'Oman, art thou lunatics? hast thou no
    understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the
    genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as
    I would desires.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Prithee, hold thy peace.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.

WILLIAM PAGE

    Forsooth, I have forgot.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    It is qui, quae, quod: if you forget your 'quies,'
    your 'quaes,' and your 'quods,' you must be
    preeches. Go your ways, and play; go.

MISTRESS PAGE

    He is a better scholar than I thought he was.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Adieu, good Sir Hugh.

    Exit SIR HUGH EVANS
    Get you home, boy. Come, we stay too long.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in FORD'S house.

    Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS FORD

FALSTAFF

    Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my
    sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,
    and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not
    only, Mistress Ford, in the simple
    office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
    complement and ceremony of it. But are you
    sure of your husband now?

MISTRESS FORD

    He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.

MISTRESS PAGE

    [Within] What, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho!

MISTRESS FORD

    Step into the chamber, Sir John.

    Exit FALSTAFF

    Enter MISTRESS PAGE

MISTRESS PAGE

    How now, sweetheart! who's at home besides yourself?

MISTRESS FORD

    Why, none but mine own people.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Indeed!

MISTRESS FORD

    No, certainly.

    Aside to her
    Speak louder.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.

MISTRESS FORD

    Why?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:
    he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails
    against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's
    daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets
    himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer
    out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but
    tameness, civility and patience, to this his
    distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.

MISTRESS FORD

    Why, does he talk of him?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the
    last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests
    to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and
    the rest of their company from their sport, to make
    another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad
    the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.

MISTRESS FORD

    How near is he, Mistress Page?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.

MISTRESS FORD

    I am undone! The knight is here.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead
    man. What a woman are you!--Away with him, away
    with him! better shame than murder.

FORD

    Which way should be go? how should I bestow him?
    Shall I put him into the basket again?

    Re-enter FALSTAFF

FALSTAFF

    No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go
    out ere he come?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door
    with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise
    you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?

FALSTAFF

    What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.

MISTRESS FORD

    There they always use to discharge their
    birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.

FALSTAFF

    Where is it?

MISTRESS FORD

    He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,
    coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
    abstract for the remembrance of such places, and
    goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.

FALSTAFF

    I'll go out then.

MISTRESS PAGE

    If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir
    John. Unless you go out disguised--

MISTRESS FORD

    How might we disguise him?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown
    big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,
    a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.

FALSTAFF

    Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather
    than a mischief.

MISTRESS FORD

    My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a
    gown above.

MISTRESS PAGE

    On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he
    is: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler
    too. Run up, Sir John.

MISTRESS FORD

    Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will
    look some linen for your head.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put
    on the gown the while.

    Exit FALSTAFF

MISTRESS FORD

    I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he
    cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears
    she's a witch; forbade her my house and hath
    threatened to beat her.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the
    devil guide his cudgel afterwards!

MISTRESS FORD

    But is my husband coming?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket
    too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.

MISTRESS FORD

    We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the
    basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as
    they did last time.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him
    like the witch of Brentford.

MISTRESS FORD

    I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the
    basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.

    Exit

MISTRESS PAGE

    Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough.
    We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,
    Wives may be merry, and yet honest too:
    We do not act that often jest and laugh;
    'Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.

    Exit

    Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two Servants

MISTRESS FORD

    Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders:
    your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it
    down, obey him: quickly, dispatch.

    Exit

First Servant

    Come, come, take it up.

Second Servant

    Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.

First Servant

    I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead.

    Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS

FORD

    Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any
    way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,
    villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!
    O you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a
    pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil
    be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!
    Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!

PAGE

    Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go
    loose any longer; you must be pinioned.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog!

SHALLOW

    Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.

FORD

    So say I too, sir.

    Re-enter MISTRESS FORD
    Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford the honest
    woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that
    hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect
    without cause, mistress, do I?

MISTRESS FORD

    Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in
    any dishonesty.

FORD

    Well said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah!

    Pulling clothes out of the basket

PAGE

    This passes!

MISTRESS FORD

    Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.

FORD

    I shall find you anon.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    'Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your wife's
    clothes? Come away.

FORD

    Empty the basket, I say!

MISTRESS FORD

    Why, man, why?

FORD

    Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed
    out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may
    not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:
    my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.
    Pluck me out all the linen.

MISTRESS FORD

    If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.

PAGE

    Here's no man.

SHALLOW

    By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this
    wrongs you.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the
    imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.

FORD

    Well, he's not here I seek for.

PAGE

    No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.

FORD

    Help to search my house this one time. If I find
    not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let
    me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of
    me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow
    walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;
    once more search with me.

MISTRESS FORD

    What, ho, Mistress Page! come you and the old woman
    down; my husband will come into the chamber.

FORD

    Old woman! what old woman's that?

MISTRESS FORD

    Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford.

FORD

    A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not
    forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does
    she? We are simple men; we do not know what's
    brought to pass under the profession of
    fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,
    by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond
    our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,
    you hag, you; come down, I say!

MISTRESS FORD

    Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him
    not strike the old woman.

    Re-enter FALSTAFF in woman's clothes, and MISTRESS PAGE

MISTRESS PAGE

    Come, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.

FORD

    I'll prat her.

    Beating him
    Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you
    polecat, you runyon! out, out! I'll conjure you,
    I'll fortune-tell you.

    Exit FALSTAFF

MISTRESS PAGE

    Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the
    poor woman.

MISTRESS FORD

    Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.

FORD

    Hang her, witch!

SIR HUGH EVANS

    By the yea and no, I think the 'oman is a witch
    indeed: I like not when a 'oman has a great peard;
    I spy a great peard under his muffler.

FORD

    Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow;
    see but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus
    upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.

PAGE

    Let's obey his humour a little further: come,
    gentlemen.

    Exeunt FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS

MISTRESS PAGE

    Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.

MISTRESS FORD

    Nay, by the mass, that he did not; he beat him most
    unpitifully, methought.

MISTRESS PAGE

    I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the
    altar; it hath done meritorious service.

MISTRESS FORD

    What think you? may we, with the warrant of
    womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,
    pursue him with any further revenge?

MISTRESS PAGE

    The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of
    him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with
    fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the
    way of waste, attempt us again.

MISTRESS FORD

    Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the
    figures out of your husband's brains. If they can
    find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight
    shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be
    the ministers.

MISTRESS FORD

    I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed: and
    methinks there would be no period to the jest,
    should he not be publicly shamed.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Come, to the forge with it then; shape it: I would
    not have things cool.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in the Garter Inn.

    Enter Host and BARDOLPH

BARDOLPH

    Sir, the Germans desire to have three of your
    horses: the duke himself will be to-morrow at
    court, and they are going to meet him.

Host

    What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear
    not of him in the court. Let me speak with the
    gentlemen: they speak English?

BARDOLPH

    Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.

Host

    They shall have my horses; but I'll make them pay;
    I'll sauce them: they have had my house a week at
    command; I have turned away my other guests: they
    must come off; I'll sauce them. Come.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in FORD'S house.

    Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS

SIR HUGH EVANS

    'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever
    I did look upon.

PAGE

    And did he send you both these letters at an instant?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Within a quarter of an hour.

FORD

    Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
    I rather will suspect the sun with cold
    Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand
    In him that was of late an heretic,
    As firm as faith.

PAGE

    'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:
    Be not as extreme in submission
    As in offence.
    But let our plot go forward: let our wives
    Yet once again, to make us public sport,
    Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,
    Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.

FORD

    There is no better way than that they spoke of.

PAGE

    How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park
    at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
    been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks
    there should be terrors in him that he should not
    come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have
    no desires.

PAGE

    So think I too.

MISTRESS FORD

    Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
    And let us two devise to bring him thither.

MISTRESS PAGE

    There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
    Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,
    Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
    Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
    And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
    And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
    In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
    You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
    The superstitious idle-headed eld
    Received and did deliver to our age
    This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.

PAGE

    Why, yet there want not many that do fear
    In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:
    But what of this?

MISTRESS FORD

    Marry, this is our device;
    That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.

PAGE

    Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:
    And in this shape when you have brought him thither,
    What shall be done with him? what is your plot?

MISTRESS PAGE

    That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
    Nan Page my daughter and my little son
    And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
    Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,
    With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
    And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,
    As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
    Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
    With some diffused song: upon their sight,
    We two in great amazedness will fly:
    Then let them all encircle him about
    And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,
    And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
    In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
    In shape profane.

MISTRESS FORD

    And till he tell the truth,
    Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
    And burn him with their tapers.

MISTRESS PAGE

    The truth being known,
    We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,
    And mock him home to Windsor.

FORD

    The children must
    Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    I will teach the children their behaviors; and I
    will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the
    knight with my taber.

FORD

    That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.

MISTRESS PAGE

    My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,
    Finely attired in a robe of white.

PAGE

    That silk will I go buy.

    Aside
    And in that time
    Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
    And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.

FORD

    Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
    He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Fear not you that. Go get us properties
    And tricking for our fairies.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery
    honest knaveries.

    Exeunt PAGE, FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS

MISTRESS PAGE

    Go, Mistress Ford,
    Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.

    Exit MISTRESS FORD
    I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,
    And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
    That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;
    And he my husband best of all affects.
    The doctor is well money'd, and his friends
    Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,
    Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.

    Exit

SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn.

    Enter Host and SIMPLE

Host

    What wouldst thou have, boor? what: thick-skin?
    speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.

SIMPLE

    Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
    from Master Slender.

Host

    There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his
    standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about
    with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go
    knock and call; hell speak like an Anthropophaginian
    unto thee: knock, I say.

SIMPLE

    There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his
    chamber: I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come
    down; I come to speak with her, indeed.

Host

    Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed: I'll
    call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from
    thy lungs military: art thou there? it is thine
    host, thine Ephesian, calls.

FALSTAFF

    [Above] How now, mine host!

Host

    Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of
    thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her
    descend; my chambers are honourable: fie! privacy?
    fie!

    Enter FALSTAFF

FALSTAFF

    There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with
    me; but she's gone.

SIMPLE

    Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of
    Brentford?

FALSTAFF

    Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?

SIMPLE

    My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing
    her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether
    one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the
    chain or no.

FALSTAFF

    I spake with the old woman about it.

SIMPLE

    And what says she, I pray, sir?

FALSTAFF

    Marry, she says that the very same man that
    beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of
    it.

SIMPLE

    I would I could have spoken with the woman herself;
    I had other things to have spoken with her too from
    him.

FALSTAFF

    What are they? let us know.

Host

    Ay, come; quick.

SIMPLE

    I may not conceal them, sir.

Host

    Conceal them, or thou diest.

SIMPLE

    Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne
    Page; to know if it were my master's fortune to
    have her or no.

FALSTAFF

    'Tis, 'tis his fortune.

SIMPLE

    What, sir?

FALSTAFF

    To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.

SIMPLE

    May I be bold to say so, sir?

FALSTAFF

    Ay, sir; like who more bold.

SIMPLE

    I thank your worship: I shall make my master glad
    with these tidings.

    Exit

Host

    Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was
    there a wise woman with thee?

FALSTAFF

    Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught
    me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;
    and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for
    my learning.

    Enter BARDOLPH

BARDOLPH

    Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!

Host

    Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto.

BARDOLPH

    Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came
    beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
    them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,
    like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.

Host

    They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do not
    say they be fled; Germans are honest men.

    Enter SIR HUGH EVANS

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Where is mine host?

Host

    What is the matter, sir?

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Have a care of your entertainments: there is a
    friend of mine come to town tells me there is three
    cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of
    Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and
    money. I tell you for good will, look you: you
    are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and
    'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.

    Exit

    Enter DOCTOR CAIUS

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Vere is mine host de Jarteer?

Host

    Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat
    you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by
    my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to
    come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.

    Exit

Host

    Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight. I am
    undone! Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!

    Exeunt Host and BARDOLPH

FALSTAFF

    I would all the world might be cozened; for I have
    been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to
    the ear of the court, how I have been transformed
    and how my transformation hath been washed and
    cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by
    drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant
    they would whip me with their fine wits till I were
    as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered
    since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my
    wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.

    Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY
    Now, whence come you?

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    From the two parties, forsooth.

FALSTAFF

    The devil take one party and his dam the other! and
    so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more
    for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy
    of man's disposition is able to bear.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;
    speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,
    is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a
    white spot about her.

FALSTAFF

    What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was
    beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;
    and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of
    Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,
    my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,
    delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the
    stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you
    shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your
    content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good
    hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!
    Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that
    you are so crossed.

FALSTAFF

    Come up into my chamber.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Another room in the Garter Inn.

    Enter FENTON and Host

Host

    Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I
    will give over all.

FENTON

    Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
    And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee
    A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.

Host

    I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at the
    least keep your counsel.

FENTON

    From time to time I have acquainted you
    With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;
    Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,
    So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
    Even to my wish: I have a letter from her
    Of such contents as you will wonder at;
    The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
    That neither singly can be manifested,
    Without the show of both; fat Falstaff
    Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
    I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
    To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
    Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
    The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
    While other jests are something rank on foot,
    Her father hath commanded her to slip
    Away with Slender and with him at Eton
    Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,
    Her mother, ever strong against that match
    And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
    That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
    While other sports are tasking of their minds,
    And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
    Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
    She seemingly obedient likewise hath
    Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
    Her father means she shall be all in white,
    And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
    To take her by the hand and bid her go,
    She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
    The better to denote her to the doctor,
    For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
    That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
    With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
    And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
    To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
    The maid hath given consent to go with him.

Host

    Which means she to deceive, father or mother?

FENTON

    Both, my good host, to go along with me:
    And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar
    To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,
    And, in the lawful name of marrying,
    To give our hearts united ceremony.

Host

    Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:
    Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.

FENTON

    So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
    Besides, I'll make a present recompense.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. A room in the Garter Inn.

    Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS QUICKLY

FALSTAFF

    Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is
    the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
    numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in
    odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to
    get you a pair of horns.

FALSTAFF

    Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.

    Exit MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Enter FORD
    How now, Master Brook! Master Brook, the matter
    will be known to-night, or never. Be you in the
    Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall
    see wonders.

FORD

    Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me
    you had appointed?

FALSTAFF

    I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor
    old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a
    poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,
    hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,
    Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell
    you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a
    woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear
    not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know
    also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along
    with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I
    plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew
    not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow
    me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave
    Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I
    will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.
    Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Windsor Park.

    Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER

PAGE

    Come, come; we'll couch i' the castle-ditch till we
    see the light of our fairies. Remember, son Slender,
    my daughter.

SLENDER

    Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a
    nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in
    white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by
    that we know one another.

SHALLOW

    That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum'
    or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well
    enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.

PAGE

    The night is dark; light and spirits will become it
    well. Heaven prosper our sport! No man means evil
    but the devil, and we shall know him by his horns.
    Let's away; follow me.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A street leading to the Park.

    Enter MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and DOCTOR CAIUS

MISTRESS PAGE

    Master doctor, my daughter is in green: when you
    see your time, take her by the band, away with her
    to the deanery, and dispatch it quickly. Go before
    into the Park: we two must go together.

DOCTOR CAIUS

    I know vat I have to do. Adieu.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Fare you well, sir.

    Exit DOCTOR CAIUS
    My husband will not rejoice so much at the abuse of
    Falstaff as he will chafe at the doctor's marrying
    my daughter: but 'tis no matter; better a little
    chiding than a great deal of heart-break.

MISTRESS FORD

    Where is Nan now and her troop of fairies, and the
    Welsh devil Hugh?

MISTRESS PAGE

    They are all couched in a pit hard by Herne's oak,
    with obscured lights; which, at the very instant of
    Falstaff's and our meeting, they will at once
    display to the night.

MISTRESS FORD

    That cannot choose but amaze him.

MISTRESS PAGE

    If he be not amazed, he will be mocked; if he be
    amazed, he will every way be mocked.

MISTRESS FORD

    We'll betray him finely.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Against such lewdsters and their lechery
    Those that betray them do no treachery.

MISTRESS FORD

    The hour draws on. To the oak, to the oak!

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Windsor Park.

    Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised, with others as Fairies

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Trib, trib, fairies; come; and remember your parts:
    be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit; and
    when I give the watch-'ords, do as I pid you:
    come, come; trib, trib.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the Park.

    Enter FALSTAFF disguised as Herne

FALSTAFF

    The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute
    draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!
    Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love
    set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some
    respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man
    a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love
    of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew
    to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in
    the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And
    then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think
    on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot
    backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a
    Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the
    forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can
    blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my
    doe?

    Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE

MISTRESS FORD

    Sir John! art thou there, my deer? my male deer?

FALSTAFF

    My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain
    potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green
    Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let
    there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.

MISTRESS FORD

    Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.

FALSTAFF

    Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will
    keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow
    of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.
    Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?
    Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes
    restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!

    Noise within

MISTRESS PAGE

    Alas, what noise?

MISTRESS FORD

    Heaven forgive our sins

FALSTAFF

    What should this be?

MISTRESS FORD MISTRESS PAGE

    Away, away!

    They run off

FALSTAFF

    I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the
    oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would
    never else cross me thus.

    Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised as before; PISTOL, as Hobgoblin; MISTRESS QUICKLY, ANNE PAGE, and others, as Fairies, with tapers

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,
    You moonshine revellers and shades of night,
    You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,
    Attend your office and your quality.
    Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.

PISTOL

    Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.
    Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:
    Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,
    There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:
    Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.

FALSTAFF

    They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:
    I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.

    Lies down upon his face

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Where's Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid
    That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,
    Raise up the organs of her fantasy;
    Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:
    But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
    Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    About, about;
    Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:
    Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:
    That it may stand till the perpetual doom,
    In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
    Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
    The several chairs of order look you scour
    With juice of balm and every precious flower:
    Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
    With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
    And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
    Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:
    The expressure that it bears, green let it be,
    More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
    And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
    In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;
    Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,
    Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:
    Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
    Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,
    Our dance of custom round about the oak
    Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set
    And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,
    To guide our measure round about the tree.
    But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.

FALSTAFF

    Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he
    transform me to a piece of cheese!

PISTOL

    Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:
    If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
    And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
    It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.

PISTOL

    A trial, come.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Come, will this wood take fire?

    They burn him with their tapers

FALSTAFF

    Oh, Oh, Oh!

MISTRESS QUICKLY

    Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
    About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;
    And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
    SONG.
    Fie on sinful fantasy!
    Fie on lust and luxury!
    Lust is but a bloody fire,
    Kindled with unchaste desire,
    Fed in heart, whose flames aspire
    As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
    Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
    Pinch him for his villany;
    Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,
    Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.

    During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS comes one way, and steals away a boy in green; SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white; and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE. A noise of hunting is heard within. All the Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's head, and rises

    Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, and MISTRESS FORD

PAGE

    Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now
    Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?

MISTRESS PAGE

    I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher
    Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
    See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
    Become the forest better than the town?

FORD

    Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
    Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his
    horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
    enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his
    cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be
    paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for
    it, Master Brook.

MISTRESS FORD

    Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.
    I will never take you for my love again; but I will
    always count you my deer.

FALSTAFF

    I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.

FORD

    Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.

FALSTAFF

    And these are not fairies? I was three or four
    times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet
    the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my
    powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a
    received belief, in despite of the teeth of all
    rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
    how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon
    ill employment!

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your
    desires, and fairies will not pinse you.

FORD

    Well said, fairy Hugh.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.

FORD

    I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
    able to woo her in good English.

FALSTAFF

    Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that
    it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as
    this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
    have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked
    with a piece of toasted cheese.

SIR HUGH EVANS

    Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.

FALSTAFF

    'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the
    taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This
    is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking
    through the realm.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the
    virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
    and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
    that ever the devil could have made you our delight?

FORD

    What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?

MISTRESS PAGE

    A puffed man?

PAGE

    Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?

FORD

    And one that is as slanderous as Satan?

PAGE

    And as poor as Job?

FORD

    And as wicked as his wife?

SIR HUGH EVANS

    And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack
    and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and
    swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?

FALSTAFF

    Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I
    am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh
    flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use
    me as you will.

FORD

    Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one
    Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to
    whom you should have been a pander: over and above
    that you have suffered, I think to repay that money
    will be a biting affliction.

PAGE

    Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset
    to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to
    laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her
    Master Slender hath married her daughter.

MISTRESS PAGE

    [Aside] Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my
    daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.

    Enter SLENDER

SLENDER

    Whoa ho! ho, father Page!

PAGE

    Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?

SLENDER

    Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire
    know on't; would I were hanged, la, else.

PAGE

    Of what, son?

SLENDER

    I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,
    and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been
    i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he
    should have swinged me. If I did not think it had
    been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis
    a postmaster's boy.

PAGE

    Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.

SLENDER

    What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took
    a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for
    all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had
    him.

PAGE

    Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how
    you should know my daughter by her garments?

SLENDER

    I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she
    cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet
    it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;
    turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is
    now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.

    Enter DOCTOR CAIUS

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'
    married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;
    it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Why, did you take her in green?

DOCTOR CAIUS

    Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.

    Exit

FORD

    This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?

PAGE

    My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.

    Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE
    How now, Master Fenton!

ANNE PAGE

    Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!

PAGE

    Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?

MISTRESS PAGE

    Why went you not with master doctor, maid?

FENTON

    You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
    You would have married her most shamefully,
    Where there was no proportion held in love.
    The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
    Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
    The offence is holy that she hath committed;
    And this deceit loses the name of craft,
    Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
    Since therein she doth evitate and shun
    A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
    Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.

FORD

    Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:
    In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;
    Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.

FALSTAFF

    I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to
    strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.

PAGE

    Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
    What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.

FALSTAFF

    When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.

MISTRESS PAGE

    Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,
    Heaven give you many, many merry days!
    Good husband, let us every one go home,
    And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;
    Sir John and all.

FORD

    Let it be so. Sir John,
    To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
    For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.

    Exeunt


The Merchant of Venice

ACT I
SCENE I. Venice. A street.

    Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO

ANTONIO

    In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
    It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
    But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
    What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
    I am to learn;
    And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
    That I have much ado to know myself.

SALARINO

    Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
    There, where your argosies with portly sail,
    Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
    Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
    Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
    That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
    As they fly by them with their woven wings.

SALANIO

    Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
    The better part of my affections would
    Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
    Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
    Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
    And every object that might make me fear
    Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
    Would make me sad.

SALARINO

    My wind cooling my broth
    Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
    What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
    I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
    But I should think of shallows and of flats,
    And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
    Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
    To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
    And see the holy edifice of stone,
    And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
    Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
    Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
    Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
    And, in a word, but even now worth this,
    And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
    To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
    That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
    But tell not me; I know, Antonio
    Is sad to think upon his merchandise.

ANTONIO

    Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
    My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
    Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
    Upon the fortune of this present year:
    Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.

SALARINO

    Why, then you are in love.

ANTONIO

    Fie, fie!

SALARINO

    Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
    Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
    For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
    Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
    Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
    Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
    And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
    And other of such vinegar aspect
    That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
    Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.

    Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO

SALANIO

    Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
    Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
    We leave you now with better company.

SALARINO

    I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
    If worthier friends had not prevented me.

ANTONIO

    Your worth is very dear in my regard.
    I take it, your own business calls on you
    And you embrace the occasion to depart.

SALARINO

    Good morrow, my good lords.

BASSANIO

    Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
    You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?

SALARINO

    We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.

    Exeunt Salarino and Salanio

LORENZO

    My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
    We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
    I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.

BASSANIO

    I will not fail you.

GRATIANO

    You look not well, Signior Antonio;
    You have too much respect upon the world:
    They lose it that do buy it with much care:
    Believe me, you are marvellously changed.

ANTONIO

    I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
    A stage where every man must play a part,
    And mine a sad one.

GRATIANO

    Let me play the fool:
    With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
    And let my liver rather heat with wine
    Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
    Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
    Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
    Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
    By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
    I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
    There are a sort of men whose visages
    Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
    And do a wilful stillness entertain,
    With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
    Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
    As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
    And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
    O my Antonio, I do know of these
    That therefore only are reputed wise
    For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
    If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
    Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
    I'll tell thee more of this another time:
    But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
    For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
    Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
    I'll end my exhortation after dinner.

LORENZO

    Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
    I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
    For Gratiano never lets me speak.

GRATIANO

    Well, keep me company but two years moe,
    Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.

ANTONIO

    Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.

GRATIANO

    Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
    In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.

    Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO

ANTONIO

    Is that any thing now?

BASSANIO

    Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
    than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
    grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
    shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
    have them, they are not worth the search.

ANTONIO

    Well, tell me now what lady is the same
    To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
    That you to-day promised to tell me of?

BASSANIO

    'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
    How much I have disabled mine estate,
    By something showing a more swelling port
    Than my faint means would grant continuance:
    Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
    From such a noble rate; but my chief care
    Is to come fairly off from the great debts
    Wherein my time something too prodigal
    Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
    I owe the most, in money and in love,
    And from your love I have a warranty
    To unburden all my plots and purposes
    How to get clear of all the debts I owe.

ANTONIO

    I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
    And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
    Within the eye of honour, be assured,
    My purse, my person, my extremest means,
    Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.

BASSANIO

    In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
    I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
    The self-same way with more advised watch,
    To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
    I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
    Because what follows is pure innocence.
    I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
    That which I owe is lost; but if you please
    To shoot another arrow that self way
    Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
    As I will watch the aim, or to find both
    Or bring your latter hazard back again
    And thankfully rest debtor for the first.

ANTONIO

    You know me well, and herein spend but time
    To wind about my love with circumstance;
    And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
    In making question of my uttermost
    Than if you had made waste of all I have:
    Then do but say to me what I should do
    That in your knowledge may by me be done,
    And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.

BASSANIO

    In Belmont is a lady richly left;
    And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
    Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
    I did receive fair speechless messages:
    Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
    To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
    Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
    For the four winds blow in from every coast
    Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
    Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
    Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
    And many Jasons come in quest of her.
    O my Antonio, had I but the means
    To hold a rival place with one of them,
    I have a mind presages me such thrift,
    That I should questionless be fortunate!

ANTONIO

    Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
    Neither have I money nor commodity
    To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
    Try what my credit can in Venice do:
    That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
    To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
    Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
    Where money is, and I no question make
    To have it of my trust or for my sake.

    Exeunt
    SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

    Enter PORTIA and NERISSA

PORTIA

    By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
    this great world.

NERISSA

    You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
    the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
    yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
    with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
    is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
    mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
    competency lives longer.

PORTIA

    Good sentences and well pronounced.

NERISSA

    They would be better, if well followed.

PORTIA

    If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
    do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
    cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
    follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
    twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
    twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
    devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
    o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
    youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
    cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
    choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
    neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
    dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
    by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
    Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?

NERISSA

    Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
    death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
    that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
    silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
    chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
    rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
    warmth is there in your affection towards any of
    these princely suitors that are already come?

PORTIA

    I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
    them, I will describe them; and, according to my
    description, level at my affection.

NERISSA

    First, there is the Neapolitan prince.

PORTIA

    Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
    talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
    appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
    shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
    mother played false with a smith.

NERISSA

    Then there is the County Palatine.

PORTIA

    He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
    will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
    smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
    philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
    unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
    married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
    than to either of these. God defend me from these
    two!

NERISSA

    How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?

PORTIA

    God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
    In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
    he! why, he hath a horse better than the
    Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
    the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
    throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
    fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
    should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
    I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
    shall never requite him.

NERISSA

    What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
    of England?

PORTIA

    You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
    not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
    nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
    swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
    He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
    converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
    I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
    hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
    behavior every where.

NERISSA

    What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?

PORTIA

    That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
    borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
    swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
    think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
    under for another.

NERISSA

    How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?

PORTIA

    Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
    most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
    he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
    when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
    and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
    make shift to go without him.

NERISSA

    If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
    casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
    will, if you should refuse to accept him.

PORTIA

    Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
    deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
    for if the devil be within and that temptation
    without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
    thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.

NERISSA

    You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
    lords: they have acquainted me with their
    determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
    home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
    you may be won by some other sort than your father's
    imposition depending on the caskets.

PORTIA

    If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
    chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
    of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
    are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
    but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
    them a fair departure.

NERISSA

    Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
    Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
    in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?

PORTIA

    Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.

NERISSA

    True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
    eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.

PORTIA

    I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
    thy praise.

    Enter a Serving-man
    How now! what news?

Servant

    The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
    their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
    fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
    prince his master will be here to-night.

PORTIA

    If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
    heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
    be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
    of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
    rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
    Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
    Whiles we shut the gates
    upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Venice. A public place.

    Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK

SHYLOCK

    Three thousand ducats; well.

BASSANIO

    Ay, sir, for three months.

SHYLOCK

    For three months; well.

BASSANIO

    For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.

SHYLOCK

    Antonio shall become bound; well.

BASSANIO

    May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
    know your answer?

SHYLOCK

    Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.

BASSANIO

    Your answer to that.

SHYLOCK

    Antonio is a good man.

BASSANIO

    Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?

SHYLOCK

    Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
    good man is to have you understand me that he is
    sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
    hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
    Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
    hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
    other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
    are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
    and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
    mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
    winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
    sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
    take his bond.

BASSANIO

    Be assured you may.

SHYLOCK

    I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,
    I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?

BASSANIO

    If it please you to dine with us.

SHYLOCK

    Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which
    your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
    will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
    walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
    with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
    news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?

    Enter ANTONIO

BASSANIO

    This is Signior Antonio.

SHYLOCK

    [Aside] How like a fawning publican he looks!
    I hate him for he is a Christian,
    But more for that in low simplicity
    He lends out money gratis and brings down
    The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
    If I can catch him once upon the hip,
    I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
    He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
    Even there where merchants most do congregate,
    On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
    Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
    If I forgive him!

BASSANIO

    Shylock, do you hear?

SHYLOCK

    I am debating of my present store,
    And, by the near guess of my memory,
    I cannot instantly raise up the gross
    Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
    Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
    Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
    Do you desire?

    To ANTONIO
    Rest you fair, good signior;
    Your worship was the last man in our mouths.

ANTONIO

    Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
    By taking nor by giving of excess,
    Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
    I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
    How much ye would?

SHYLOCK

    Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.

ANTONIO

    And for three months.

SHYLOCK

    I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
    Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
    Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
    Upon advantage.

ANTONIO

    I do never use it.

SHYLOCK

    When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
    This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
    As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
    The third possessor; ay, he was the third--

ANTONIO

    And what of him? did he take interest?

SHYLOCK

    No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
    Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
    When Laban and himself were compromised
    That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
    Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
    In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
    And, when the work of generation was
    Between these woolly breeders in the act,
    The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
    And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
    He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
    Who then conceiving did in eaning time
    Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
    This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
    And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.

ANTONIO

    This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
    A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
    But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
    Was this inserted to make interest good?
    Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?

SHYLOCK

    I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
    But note me, signior.

ANTONIO

    Mark you this, Bassanio,
    The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
    An evil soul producing holy witness
    Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
    A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
    O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!

SHYLOCK

    Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
    Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--

ANTONIO

    Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?

SHYLOCK

    Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
    In the Rialto you have rated me
    About my moneys and my usances:
    Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
    For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
    You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
    And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
    And all for use of that which is mine own.
    Well then, it now appears you need my help:
    Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
    'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
    You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
    And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
    Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
    What should I say to you? Should I not say
    'Hath a dog money? is it possible
    A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
    Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
    With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
    'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
    You spurn'd me such a day; another time
    You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
    I'll lend you thus much moneys'?

ANTONIO

    I am as like to call thee so again,
    To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
    If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
    As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
    A breed for barren metal of his friend?
    But lend it rather to thine enemy,
    Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
    Exact the penalty.

SHYLOCK

    Why, look you, how you storm!
    I would be friends with you and have your love,
    Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
    Supply your present wants and take no doit
    Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:
    This is kind I offer.

BASSANIO

    This were kindness.

SHYLOCK

    This kindness will I show.
    Go with me to a notary, seal me there
    Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
    If you repay me not on such a day,
    In such a place, such sum or sums as are
    Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
    Be nominated for an equal pound
    Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
    In what part of your body pleaseth me.

ANTONIO

    Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond
    And say there is much kindness in the Jew.

BASSANIO

    You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
    I'll rather dwell in my necessity.

ANTONIO

    Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
    Within these two months, that's a month before
    This bond expires, I do expect return
    Of thrice three times the value of this bond.

SHYLOCK

    O father Abram, what these Christians are,
    Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
    The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
    If he should break his day, what should I gain
    By the exaction of the forfeiture?
    A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
    Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
    As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
    To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:
    If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
    And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.

ANTONIO

    Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.

SHYLOCK

    Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
    Give him direction for this merry bond,
    And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
    See to my house, left in the fearful guard
    Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
    I will be with you.

ANTONIO

    Hie thee, gentle Jew.

    Exit Shylock
    The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.

BASSANIO

    I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.

ANTONIO

    Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
    My ships come home a month before the day.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

    Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO and his train; PORTIA, NERISSA, and others attending

MOROCCO

    Mislike me not for my complexion,
    The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,
    To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
    Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
    Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
    And let us make incision for your love,
    To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
    I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
    Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
    The best-regarded virgins of our clime
    Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
    Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.

PORTIA

    In terms of choice I am not solely led
    By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
    Besides, the lottery of my destiny
    Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
    But if my father had not scanted me
    And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
    His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
    Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
    As any comer I have look'd on yet
    For my affection.

MOROCCO

    Even for that I thank you:
    Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
    To try my fortune. By this scimitar
    That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
    That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
    I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
    Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
    Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
    Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
    To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
    If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
    Which is the better man, the greater throw
    May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
    So is Alcides beaten by his page;
    And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
    Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
    And die with grieving.

PORTIA

    You must take your chance,
    And either not attempt to choose at all
    Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
    Never to speak to lady afterward
    In way of marriage: therefore be advised.

MOROCCO

    Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.

PORTIA

    First, forward to the temple: after dinner
    Your hazard shall be made.

MOROCCO

    Good fortune then!
    To make me blest or cursed'st among men.

    Cornets, and exeunt

SCENE II. Venice. A street.

    Enter LAUNCELOT

LAUNCELOT

    Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
    this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and
    tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good
    Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot
    Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My
    conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;
    take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest
    Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy
    heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
    pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
    fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'
    says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,
    hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely
    to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest
    man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,
    indeed, my father did something smack, something
    grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience
    says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the
    fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
    'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'
    say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my
    conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,
    who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to
    run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
    fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil
    himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
    incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is
    but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel
    me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
    friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are
    at your command; I will run.

    Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket

GOBBO

    Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way
    to master Jew's?

LAUNCELOT

    [Aside] O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!
    who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,
    knows me not: I will try confusions with him.

GOBBO

    Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way
    to master Jew's?

LAUNCELOT

    Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,
    at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at
    the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn
    down indirectly to the Jew's house.

GOBBO

    By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can
    you tell me whether one Launcelot,
    that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?

LAUNCELOT

    Talk you of young Master Launcelot?

    Aside
    Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you
    of young Master Launcelot?

GOBBO

    No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,
    though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man
    and, God be thanked, well to live.

LAUNCELOT

    Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of
    young Master Launcelot.

GOBBO

    Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.

LAUNCELOT

    But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,
    talk you of young Master Launcelot?

GOBBO

    Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.

LAUNCELOT

    Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master
    Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,
    according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
    sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
    learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say
    in plain terms, gone to heaven.

GOBBO

    Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my
    age, my very prop.

LAUNCELOT

    Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
    a prop? Do you know me, father?

GOBBO

    Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:
    but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his
    soul, alive or dead?

LAUNCELOT

    Do you not know me, father?

GOBBO

    Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.

LAUNCELOT

    Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of
    the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
    own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
    your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
    to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
    may, but at the length truth will out.

GOBBO

    Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not
    Launcelot, my boy.

LAUNCELOT

    Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but
    give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy
    that was, your son that is, your child that shall
    be.

GOBBO

    I cannot think you are my son.

LAUNCELOT

    I know not what I shall think of that: but I am
    Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your
    wife is my mother.

GOBBO

    Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou
    be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
    Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou
    got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
    Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.

LAUNCELOT

    It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
    backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail
    than I have of my face when I last saw him.

GOBBO

    Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy
    master agree? I have brought him a present. How
    'gree you now?

LAUNCELOT

    Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set
    up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I
    have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give
    him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
    his service; you may tell every finger I have with
    my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me
    your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,
    gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I
    will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
    fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I
    am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.

    Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers

BASSANIO

    You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper
    be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See
    these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,
    and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.

    Exit a Servant

LAUNCELOT

    To him, father.

GOBBO

    God bless your worship!

BASSANIO

    Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?

GOBBO

    Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--

LAUNCELOT

    Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that
    would, sir, as my father shall specify--

GOBBO

    He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--

LAUNCELOT

    Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,
    and have a desire, as my father shall specify--

GOBBO

    His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,
    are scarce cater-cousins--

LAUNCELOT

    To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having
    done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I
    hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--

GOBBO

    I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
    your worship, and my suit is--

LAUNCELOT

    In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
    your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,
    though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.

BASSANIO

    One speak for both. What would you?

LAUNCELOT

    Serve you, sir.

GOBBO

    That is the very defect of the matter, sir.

BASSANIO

    I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
    Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
    And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
    To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
    The follower of so poor a gentleman.

LAUNCELOT

    The old proverb is very well parted between my
    master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of
    God, sir, and he hath enough.

BASSANIO

    Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
    Take leave of thy old master and inquire
    My lodging out. Give him a livery
    More guarded than his fellows': see it done.

LAUNCELOT

    Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have
    ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in
    Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
    upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,
    here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle
    of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven
    widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
    man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be
    in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;
    here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a
    woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
    come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.

    Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo

BASSANIO

    I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:
    These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,
    Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
    My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.

LEONARDO

    My best endeavours shall be done herein.

    Enter GRATIANO

GRATIANO

    Where is your master?

LEONARDO

    Yonder, sir, he walks.

    Exit

GRATIANO

    Signior Bassanio!

BASSANIO

    Gratiano!

GRATIANO

    I have a suit to you.

BASSANIO

    You have obtain'd it.

GRATIANO

    You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.

BASSANIO

    Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;
    Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
    Parts that become thee happily enough
    And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
    But where thou art not known, why, there they show
    Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
    To allay with some cold drops of modesty
    Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior
    I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
    And lose my hopes.

GRATIANO

    Signior Bassanio, hear me:
    If I do not put on a sober habit,
    Talk with respect and swear but now and then,
    Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
    Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
    Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'
    Use all the observance of civility,
    Like one well studied in a sad ostent
    To please his grandam, never trust me more.

BASSANIO

    Well, we shall see your bearing.

GRATIANO

    Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me
    By what we do to-night.

BASSANIO

    No, that were pity:
    I would entreat you rather to put on
    Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
    That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
    I have some business.

GRATIANO

    And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:
    But we will visit you at supper-time.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. A room in SHYLOCK'S house.

    Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT

JESSICA

    I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
    Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
    Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
    But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:
    And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
    Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
    Give him this letter; do it secretly;
    And so farewell: I would not have my father
    See me in talk with thee.

LAUNCELOT

    Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful
    pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play
    the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,
    adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my
    manly spirit: adieu.

JESSICA

    Farewell, good Launcelot.

    Exit Launcelot
    Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
    To be ashamed to be my father's child!
    But though I am a daughter to his blood,
    I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,
    If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
    Become a Christian and thy loving wife.

    Exit

SCENE IV. The same. A street.

    Enter GRATIANO, LORENZO, SALARINO, and SALANIO

LORENZO

    Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
    Disguise us at my lodging and return,
    All in an hour.

GRATIANO

    We have not made good preparation.

SALARINO

    We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.

SALANIO

    'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
    And better in my mind not undertook.

LORENZO

    'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
    To furnish us.

    Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter
    Friend Launcelot, what's the news?

LAUNCELOT

    An it shall please you to break up
    this, it shall seem to signify.

LORENZO

    I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
    And whiter than the paper it writ on
    Is the fair hand that writ.

GRATIANO

    Love-news, in faith.

LAUNCELOT

    By your leave, sir.

LORENZO

    Whither goest thou?

LAUNCELOT

    Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
    Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.

LORENZO

    Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
    I will not fail her; speak it privately.
    Go, gentlemen,

    Exit Launcelot
    Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
    I am provided of a torch-bearer.

SALANIO

    Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.

SALANIO

    And so will I.

LORENZO

    Meet me and Gratiano
    At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.

SALARINO

    'Tis good we do so.

    Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO

GRATIANO

    Was not that letter from fair Jessica?

LORENZO

    I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
    How I shall take her from her father's house,
    What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
    What page's suit she hath in readiness.
    If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
    It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
    And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
    Unless she do it under this excuse,
    That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
    Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
    Fair Jessica shall be my torch-beare r.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. The same. Before SHYLOCK'S house.

    Enter SHYLOCK and LAUNCELOT

SHYLOCK

    Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
    The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
    What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
    As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--
    And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
    Why, Jessica, I say!

LAUNCELOT

    Why, Jessica!

SHYLOCK

    Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.

LAUNCELOT

    Your worship was wont to tell me that
    I could do nothing without bidding.

    Enter Jessica

JESSICA

    Call you? what is your will?

SHYLOCK

    I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
    There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
    I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
    But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
    The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
    Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
    There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
    For I did dream of money-bags to-night.

LAUNCELOT

    I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect
    your reproach.

SHYLOCK

    So do I his.

LAUNCELOT

    An they have conspired together, I will not say you
    shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not
    for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
    Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,
    falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
    year, in the afternoon.

SHYLOCK

    What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
    Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
    And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
    Clamber not you up to the casements then,
    Nor thrust your head into the public street
    To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,
    But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:
    Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
    My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
    I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
    But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;
    Say I will come.

LAUNCELOT

    I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at
    window, for all this, There will come a Christian
    boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.

    Exit

SHYLOCK

    What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?

JESSICA

    His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.

SHYLOCK

    The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
    Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
    More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;
    Therefore I part with him, and part with him
    To one that would have him help to waste
    His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
    Perhaps I will return immediately:
    Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
    Fast bind, fast find;
    A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.

    Exit

JESSICA

    Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
    I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

    Exit

SCENE VI. The same.

    Enter GRATIANO and SALARINO, masqued

GRATIANO

    This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
    Desired us to make stand.

SALARINO

    His hour is almost past.

GRATIANO

    And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
    For lovers ever run before the clock.

SALARINO

    O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
    To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
    To keep obliged faith unforfeited!

GRATIANO

    That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
    With that keen appetite that he sits down?
    Where is the horse that doth untread again
    His tedious measures with the unbated fire
    That he did pace them first? All things that are,
    Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
    How like a younker or a prodigal
    The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
    Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
    How like the prodigal doth she return,
    With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
    Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!

SALARINO

    Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.

    Enter LORENZO

LORENZO

    Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
    Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
    When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
    I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
    Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?

    Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes

JESSICA

    Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
    Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.

LORENZO

    Lorenzo, and thy love.

JESSICA

    Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
    For who love I so much? And now who knows
    But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?

LORENZO

    Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.

JESSICA

    Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
    I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
    For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
    But love is blind and lovers cannot see
    The pretty follies that themselves commit;
    For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
    To see me thus transformed to a boy.

LORENZO

    Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.

JESSICA

    What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
    They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
    Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
    And I should be obscured.

LORENZO

    So are you, sweet,
    Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
    But come at once;
    For the close night doth play the runaway,
    And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.

JESSICA

    I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
    With some more ducats, and be with you straight.

    Exit above

GRATIANO

    Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.

LORENZO

    Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
    For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
    And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
    And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
    And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
    Shall she be placed in my constant soul.

    Enter JESSICA, below
    What, art thou come? On, gentlemen; away!
    Our masquing mates by this time for us stay.

    Exit with Jessica and Salarino

    Enter ANTONIO

ANTONIO

    Who's there?

GRATIANO

    Signior Antonio!

ANTONIO

    Fie, fie, Gratiano! where are all the rest?
    'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
    No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
    Bassanio presently will go aboard:
    I have sent twenty out to seek for you.

GRATIANO

    I am glad on't: I desire no more delight
    Than to be under sail and gone to-night.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

    Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the PRINCE OF MOROCCO, and their trains

PORTIA

    Go draw aside the curtains and discover
    The several caskets to this noble prince.
    Now make your choice.

MOROCCO

    The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
    'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
    The second, silver, which this promise carries,
    'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
    This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
    'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
    How shall I know if I do choose the right?

PORTIA

    The one of them contains my picture, prince:
    If you choose that, then I am yours withal.

MOROCCO

    Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
    I will survey the inscriptions back again.
    What says this leaden casket?
    'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
    Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
    This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
    Do it in hope of fair advantages:
    A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
    I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
    What says the silver with her virgin hue?
    'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
    As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
    And weigh thy value with an even hand:
    If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
    Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
    May not extend so far as to the lady:
    And yet to be afeard of my deserving
    Were but a weak disabling of myself.
    As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:
    I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
    In graces and in qualities of breeding;
    But more than these, in love I do deserve.
    What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
    Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
    'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
    Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
    From the four corners of the earth they come,
    To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
    The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
    Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
    For princes to come view fair Portia:
    The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
    Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
    To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
    As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
    One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
    Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
    To think so base a thought: it were too gross
    To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
    Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
    Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
    O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
    Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
    A coin that bears the figure of an angel
    Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
    But here an angel in a golden bed
    Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
    Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!

PORTIA

    There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
    Then I am yours.

    He unlocks the golden casket

MOROCCO

    O hell! what have we here?
    A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
    There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.

    Reads
    All that glitters is not gold;
    Often have you heard that told:
    Many a man his life hath sold
    But my outside to behold:
    Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
    Had you been as wise as bold,
    Young in limbs, in judgment old,
    Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
    Fare you well; your suit is cold.
    Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
    Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
    Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
    To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.

    Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets

PORTIA

    A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.
    Let all of his complexion choose me so.

    Exeunt

SCENE VIII. Venice. A street.

    Enter SALARINO and SALANIO

SALARINO

    Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
    With him is Gratiano gone along;
    And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.

SALANIO

    The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
    Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.

SALARINO

    He came too late, the ship was under sail:
    But there the duke was given to understand
    That in a gondola were seen together
    Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
    Besides, Antonio certified the duke
    They were not with Bassanio in his ship.

SALANIO

    I never heard a passion so confused,
    So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
    As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
    'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
    Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
    Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
    A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
    Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!
    And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
    Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
    She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'

SALARINO

    Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
    Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.

SALANIO

    Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
    Or he shall pay for this.

SALARINO

    Marry, well remember'd.
    I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
    Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
    The French and English, there miscarried
    A vessel of our country richly fraught:
    I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
    And wish'd in silence that it were not his.

SALANIO

    You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
    Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.

SALARINO

    A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
    I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
    Bassanio told him he would make some speed
    Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
    Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
    But stay the very riping of the time;
    And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
    Let it not enter in your mind of love:
    Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
    To courtship and such fair ostents of love
    As shall conveniently become you there:'
    And even there, his eye being big with tears,
    Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
    And with affection wondrous sensible
    He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.

SALANIO

    I think he only loves the world for him.
    I pray thee, let us go and find him out
    And quicken his embraced heaviness
    With some delight or other.

SALARINO

    Do we so.

    Exeunt

SCENE IX. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

    Enter NERISSA with a Servitor

NERISSA

    Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:
    The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
    And comes to his election presently.

    Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON, PORTIA, and their trains

PORTIA

    Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
    If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
    Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
    But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
    You must be gone from hence immediately.

ARRAGON

    I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
    First, never to unfold to any one
    Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
    Of the right casket, never in my life
    To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
    If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
    Immediately to leave you and be gone.

PORTIA

    To these injunctions every one doth swear
    That comes to hazard for my worthless self.

ARRAGON

    And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
    To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
    'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
    You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
    What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
    'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
    What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
    By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
    Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
    Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
    Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
    Even in the force and road of casualty.
    I will not choose what many men desire,
    Because I will not jump with common spirits
    And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
    Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
    Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
    'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
    And well said too; for who shall go about
    To cozen fortune and be honourable
    Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
    To wear an undeserved dignity.
    O, that estates, degrees and offices
    Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
    Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
    How many then should cover that stand bare!
    How many be commanded that command!
    How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
    From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
    Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
    To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
    'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
    I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
    And instantly unlock my fortunes here.

    He opens the silver casket

PORTIA

    Too long a pause for that which you find there.

ARRAGON

    What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
    Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
    How much unlike art thou to Portia!
    How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
    'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
    Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
    Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?

PORTIA

    To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
    And of opposed natures.

ARRAGON

    What is here?

    Reads
    The fire seven times tried this:
    Seven times tried that judgment is,
    That did never choose amiss.
    Some there be that shadows kiss;
    Such have but a shadow's bliss:
    There be fools alive, I wis,
    Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
    Take what wife you will to bed,
    I will ever be your head:
    So be gone: you are sped.
    Still more fool I shall appear
    By the time I linger here
    With one fool's head I came to woo,
    But I go away with two.
    Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
    Patiently to bear my wroth.

    Exeunt Arragon and train

PORTIA

    Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
    O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
    They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.

NERISSA

    The ancient saying is no heresy,
    Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.

PORTIA

    Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.

    Enter a Servant

Servant

    Where is my lady?

PORTIA

    Here: what would my lord?

Servant

    Madam, there is alighted at your gate
    A young Venetian, one that comes before
    To signify the approaching of his lord;
    From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
    To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
    Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
    So likely an ambassador of love:
    A day in April never came so sweet,
    To show how costly summer was at hand,
    As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.

PORTIA

    No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
    Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
    Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
    Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
    Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.

NERISSA

    Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Venice. A street.

    Enter SALANIO and SALARINO

SALANIO

    Now, what news on the Rialto?

SALARINO

    Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath
    a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;
    the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very
    dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many
    a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
    Report be an honest woman of her word.

SALANIO

    I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
    knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
    wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
    true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
    plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
    honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough
    to keep his name company!--

SALARINO

    Come, the full stop.

SALANIO

    Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
    lost a ship.

SALARINO

    I would it might prove the end of his losses.

SALANIO

    Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my
    prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.

    Enter SHYLOCK
    How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?

SHYLOCK

    You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my
    daughter's flight.

SALARINO

    That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor
    that made the wings she flew withal.

SALANIO

    And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was
    fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
    to leave the dam.

SHYLOCK

    She is damned for it.

SALANIO

    That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.

SHYLOCK

    My own flesh and blood to rebel!

SALANIO

    Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?

SHYLOCK

    I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.

SALARINO

    There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
    than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
    than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
    tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
    loss at sea or no?

SHYLOCK

    There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
    prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the
    Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon
    the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
    call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
    wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
    look to his bond.

SALARINO

    Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take
    his flesh: what's that good for?

SHYLOCK

    To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,
    it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
    hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,
    mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
    bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
    enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
    not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
    dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
    the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
    to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
    warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
    a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
    if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
    us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
    revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
    resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
    what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
    wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
    Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
    teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
    will better the instruction.

    Enter a Servant

Servant

    Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and
    desires to speak with you both.

SALARINO

    We have been up and down to seek him.

    Enter TUBAL

SALANIO

    Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be
    matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.

    Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant

SHYLOCK

    How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou
    found my daughter?

TUBAL

    I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.

SHYLOCK

    Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,
    cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse
    never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it
    till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other
    precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter
    were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!
    would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in
    her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know
    not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon
    loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to
    find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:
    nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
    shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears
    but of my shedding.

TUBAL

    Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I
    heard in Genoa,--

SHYLOCK

    What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?

TUBAL

    Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.

SHYLOCK

    I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?

TUBAL

    I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.

SHYLOCK

    I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!
    ha, ha! where? in Genoa?

TUBAL

    Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one
    night fourscore ducats.

SHYLOCK

    Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my
    gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
    fourscore ducats!

TUBAL

    There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
    company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.

SHYLOCK

    I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture
    him: I am glad of it.

TUBAL

    One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
    daughter for a monkey.

SHYLOCK

    Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
    turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:
    I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.

TUBAL

    But Antonio is certainly undone.

SHYLOCK

    Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee
    me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I
    will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were
    he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I
    will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;
    go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

    Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and Attendants

PORTIA

    I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
    Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
    I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
    There's something tells me, but it is not love,
    I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
    Hate counsels not in such a quality.
    But lest you should not understand me well,--
    And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
    I would detain you here some month or two
    Before you venture for me. I could teach you
    How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
    So will I never be: so may you miss me;
    But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
    That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
    They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
    One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
    Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
    And so all yours. O, these naughty times
    Put bars between the owners and their rights!
    And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
    Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
    I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
    To eke it and to draw it out in length,
    To stay you from election.

BASSANIO

    Let me choose
    For as I am, I live upon the rack.

PORTIA

    Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
    What treason there is mingled with your love.

BASSANIO

    None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
    Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
    There may as well be amity and life
    'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.

PORTIA

    Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
    Where men enforced do speak anything.

BASSANIO

    Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.

PORTIA

    Well then, confess and live.

BASSANIO

    'Confess' and 'love'
    Had been the very sum of my confession:
    O happy torment, when my torturer
    Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
    But let me to my fortune and the caskets.

PORTIA

    Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:
    If you do love me, you will find me out.
    Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
    Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
    Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
    Fading in music: that the comparison
    May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
    And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
    And what is music then? Then music is
    Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
    To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
    As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
    That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
    And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
    With no less presence, but with much more love,
    Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
    The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
    To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
    The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
    With bleared visages, come forth to view
    The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
    Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
    I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.

    Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself
    SONG.
    Tell me where is fancy bred,
    Or in the heart, or in the head?
    How begot, how nourished?
    Reply, reply.
    It is engender'd in the eyes,
    With gazing fed; and fancy dies
    In the cradle where it lies.
    Let us all ring fancy's knell
    I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.

ALL

    Ding, dong, bell.

BASSANIO

    So may the outward shows be least themselves:
    The world is still deceived with ornament.
    In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
    But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
    Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
    What damned error, but some sober brow
    Will bless it and approve it with a text,
    Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
    There is no vice so simple but assumes
    Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
    How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
    As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
    The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
    Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
    And these assume but valour's excrement
    To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
    And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
    Which therein works a miracle in nature,
    Making them lightest that wear most of it:
    So are those crisped snaky golden locks
    Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
    Upon supposed fairness, often known
    To be the dowry of a second head,
    The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
    Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
    To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
    Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
    The seeming truth which cunning times put on
    To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
    Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
    Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
    'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
    Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
    Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
    And here choose I; joy be the consequence!

PORTIA

    [Aside] How all the other passions fleet to air,
    As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
    And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,
    Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,
    In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
    I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
    For fear I surfeit.

BASSANIO

    What find I here?

    Opening the leaden casket
    Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
    Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
    Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
    Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
    Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
    Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
    The painter plays the spider and hath woven
    A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
    Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
    How could he see to do them? having made one,
    Methinks it should have power to steal both his
    And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
    The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
    In underprizing it, so far this shadow
    Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
    The continent and summary of my fortune.

    Reads
    You that choose not by the view,
    Chance as fair and choose as true!
    Since this fortune falls to you,
    Be content and seek no new,
    If you be well pleased with this
    And hold your fortune for your bliss,
    Turn you where your lady is
    And claim her with a loving kiss.
    A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
    I come by note, to give and to receive.
    Like one of two contending in a prize,
    That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
    Hearing applause and universal shout,
    Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
    Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
    So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
    As doubtful whether what I see be true,
    Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.

PORTIA

    You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
    Such as I am: though for myself alone
    I would not be ambitious in my wish,
    To wish myself much better; yet, for you
    I would be trebled twenty times myself;
    A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
    That only to stand high in your account,
    I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
    Exceed account; but the full sum of me
    Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
    Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;
    Happy in this, she is not yet so old
    But she may learn; happier than this,
    She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
    Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
    Commits itself to yours to be directed,
    As from her lord, her governor, her king.
    Myself and what is mine to you and yours
    Is now converted: but now I was the lord
    Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
    Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
    This house, these servants and this same myself
    Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
    Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
    Let it presage the ruin of your love
    And be my vantage to exclaim on you.

BASSANIO

    Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
    Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
    And there is such confusion in my powers,
    As after some oration fairly spoke
    By a beloved prince, there doth appear
    Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
    Where every something, being blent together,
    Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
    Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
    Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
    O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!

NERISSA

    My lord and lady, it is now our time,
    That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
    To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!

GRATIANO

    My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
    I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
    For I am sure you can wish none from me:
    And when your honours mean to solemnize
    The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
    Even at that time I may be married too.

BASSANIO

    With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.

GRATIANO

    I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
    My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
    You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
    You loved, I loved for intermission.
    No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
    Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
    And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
    For wooing here until I sweat again,
    And sweating until my very roof was dry
    With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
    I got a promise of this fair one here
    To have her love, provided that your fortune
    Achieved her mistress.

PORTIA

    Is this true, Nerissa?

NERISSA

    Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.

BASSANIO

    And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?

GRATIANO

    Yes, faith, my lord.

BASSANIO

    Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.

GRATIANO

    We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.

NERISSA

    What, and stake down?

GRATIANO

    No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
    But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
    and my old Venetian friend Salerio?

    Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger from Venice

BASSANIO

    Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
    If that the youth of my new interest here
    Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
    I bid my very friends and countrymen,
    Sweet Portia, welcome.

PORTIA

    So do I, my lord:
    They are entirely welcome.

LORENZO

    I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
    My purpose was not to have seen you here;
    But meeting with Salerio by the way,
    He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
    To come with him along.

SALERIO

    I did, my lord;
    And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
    Commends him to you.

    Gives Bassanio a letter

BASSANIO

    Ere I ope his letter,
    I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.

SALERIO

    Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
    Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
    Will show you his estate.

GRATIANO

    Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
    Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
    How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
    I know he will be glad of our success;
    We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.

SALERIO

    I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.

PORTIA

    There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
    That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
    Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
    Could turn so much the constitution
    Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
    With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
    And I must freely have the half of anything
    That this same paper brings you.

BASSANIO

    O sweet Portia,
    Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
    That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
    When I did first impart my love to you,
    I freely told you, all the wealth I had
    Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
    And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
    Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
    How much I was a braggart. When I told you
    My state was nothing, I should then have told you
    That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
    I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
    Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
    To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
    The paper as the body of my friend,
    And every word in it a gaping wound,
    Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
    Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
    From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
    From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
    And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
    Of merchant-marring rocks?

SALERIO

    Not one, my lord.
    Besides, it should appear, that if he had
    The present money to discharge the Jew,
    He would not take it. Never did I know
    A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
    So keen and greedy to confound a man:
    He plies the duke at morning and at night,
    And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
    If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
    The duke himself, and the magnificoes
    Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
    But none can drive him from the envious plea
    Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.

JESSICA

    When I was with him I have heard him swear
    To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
    That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
    Than twenty times the value of the sum
    That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
    If law, authority and power deny not,
    It will go hard with poor Antonio.

PORTIA

    Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?

BASSANIO

    The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
    The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
    In doing courtesies, and one in whom
    The ancient Roman honour more appears
    Than any that draws breath in Italy.

PORTIA

    What sum owes he the Jew?

BASSANIO

    For me three thousand ducats.

PORTIA

    What, no more?
    Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
    Double six thousand, and then treble that,
    Before a friend of this description
    Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
    First go with me to church and call me wife,
    And then away to Venice to your friend;
    For never shall you lie by Portia's side
    With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
    To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
    When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
    My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
    Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
    For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
    Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
    Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
    But let me hear the letter of your friend.

BASSANIO

    [Reads] Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
    miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is
    very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since
    in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all
    debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but
    see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your
    pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,
    let not my letter.

PORTIA

    O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!

BASSANIO

    Since I have your good leave to go away,
    I will make haste: but, till I come again,
    No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
    No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Venice. A street.

    Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler

SHYLOCK

    Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
    This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
    Gaoler, look to him.

ANTONIO

    Hear me yet, good Shylock.

SHYLOCK

    I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
    I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
    Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
    But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
    The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
    Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
    To come abroad with him at his request.

ANTONIO

    I pray thee, hear me speak.

SHYLOCK

    I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
    I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
    I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
    To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
    To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
    I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.

    Exit

SALARINO

    It is the most impenetrable cur
    That ever kept with men.

ANTONIO

    Let him alone:
    I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
    He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
    I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
    Many that have at times made moan to me;
    Therefore he hates me.

SALARINO

    I am sure the duke
    Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.

ANTONIO

    The duke cannot deny the course of law:
    For the commodity that strangers have
    With us in Venice, if it be denied,
    Will much impeach the justice of his state;
    Since that the trade and profit of the city
    Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
    These griefs and losses have so bated me,
    That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
    To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
    Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
    To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

    Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and BALTHASAR

LORENZO

    Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
    You have a noble and a true conceit
    Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
    In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
    But if you knew to whom you show this honour,
    How true a gentleman you send relief,
    How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
    I know you would be prouder of the work
    Than customary bounty can enforce you.

PORTIA

    I never did repent for doing good,
    Nor shall not now: for in companions
    That do converse and waste the time together,
    Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,
    There must be needs a like proportion
    Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
    Which makes me think that this Antonio,
    Being the bosom lover of my lord,
    Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
    How little is the cost I have bestow'd
    In purchasing the semblance of my soul
    From out the state of hellish misery!
    This comes too near the praising of myself;
    Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
    Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
    The husbandry and manage of my house
    Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
    I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
    To live in prayer and contemplation,
    Only attended by Nerissa here,
    Until her husband and my lord's return:
    There is a monastery two miles off;
    And there will we abide. I do desire you
    Not to deny this imposition;
    The which my love and some necessity
    Now lays upon you.

LORENZO

    Madam, with all my heart;
    I shall obey you in all fair commands.

PORTIA

    My people do already know my mind,
    And will acknowledge you and Jessica
    In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
    And so farewell, till we shall meet again.

LORENZO

    Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!

JESSICA

    I wish your ladyship all heart's content.

PORTIA

    I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased
    To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.

    Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO
    Now, Balthasar,
    As I have ever found thee honest-true,
    So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
    And use thou all the endeavour of a man
    In speed to Padua: see thou render this
    Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;
    And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,
    Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed
    Unto the tranect, to the common ferry
    Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
    But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.

BALTHASAR

    Madam, I go with all convenient speed.

    Exit

PORTIA

    Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand
    That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
    Before they think of us.

NERISSA

    Shall they see us?

PORTIA

    They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,
    That they shall think we are accomplished
    With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,
    When we are both accoutred like young men,
    I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
    And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
    And speak between the change of man and boy
    With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
    Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
    Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
    How honourable ladies sought my love,
    Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
    I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
    And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;
    And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
    That men shall swear I have discontinued school
    Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
    A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
    Which I will practise.

NERISSA

    Why, shall we turn to men?

PORTIA

    Fie, what a question's that,
    If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
    But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
    When I am in my coach, which stays for us
    At the park gate; and therefore haste away,
    For we must measure twenty miles to-day.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. The same. A garden.

    Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA

LAUNCELOT

    Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father
    are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I
    promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with
    you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:
    therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
    are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
    you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
    hope neither.

JESSICA

    And what hope is that, I pray thee?

LAUNCELOT

    Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
    not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.

JESSICA

    That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the
    sins of my mother should be visited upon me.

LAUNCELOT

    Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
    mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I
    fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are
    gone both ways.

JESSICA

    I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
    Christian.

LAUNCELOT

    Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
    enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by
    another. This making Christians will raise the
    price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we
    shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.

    Enter LORENZO

JESSICA

    I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.

LORENZO

    I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if
    you thus get my wife into corners.

JESSICA

    Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I
    are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
    me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he
    says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
    for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
    price of pork.

LORENZO

    I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
    you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
    Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.

LAUNCELOT

    It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
    but if she be less than an honest woman, she is
    indeed more than I took her for.

LORENZO

    How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
    best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,
    and discourse grow commendable in none only but
    parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.

LAUNCELOT

    That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.

LORENZO

    Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid
    them prepare dinner.

LAUNCELOT

    That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.

LORENZO

    Will you cover then, sir?

LAUNCELOT

    Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.

LORENZO

    Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
    the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
    tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:
    go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve
    in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.

LAUNCELOT

    For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the
    meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in
    to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and
    conceits shall govern.

    Exit

LORENZO

    O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
    The fool hath planted in his memory
    An army of good words; and I do know
    A many fools, that stand in better place,
    Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
    Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?
    And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
    How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?

JESSICA

    Past all expressing. It is very meet
    The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
    For, having such a blessing in his lady,
    He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
    And if on earth he do not mean it, then
    In reason he should never come to heaven
    Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
    And on the wager lay two earthly women,
    And Portia one, there must be something else
    Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
    Hath not her fellow.

LORENZO

    Even such a husband
    Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.

JESSICA

    Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.

LORENZO

    I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.

JESSICA

    Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.

LORENZO

    No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
    ' Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things
    I shall digest it.

JESSICA

    Well, I'll set you forth.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Venice. A court of justice.

    Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others

DUKE

    What, is Antonio here?

ANTONIO

    Ready, so please your grace.

DUKE

    I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
    A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
    uncapable of pity, void and empty
    From any dram of mercy.

ANTONIO

    I have heard
    Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
    His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
    And that no lawful means can carry me
    Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
    My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
    To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
    The very tyranny and rage of his.

DUKE

    Go one, and call the Jew into the court.

SALERIO

    He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.

    Enter SHYLOCK

DUKE

    Make room, and let him stand before our face.
    Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
    That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
    To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
    Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
    Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
    And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
    Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
    Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
    But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
    Forgive a moiety of the principal;
    Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
    That have of late so huddled on his back,
    Enow to press a royal merchant down
    And pluck commiseration of his state
    From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
    From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
    To offices of tender courtesy.
    We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.

SHYLOCK

    I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
    And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
    To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
    If you deny it, let the danger light
    Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
    You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
    A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
    Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
    But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
    What if my house be troubled with a rat
    And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
    To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
    Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
    Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
    And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
    Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
    Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
    Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
    As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
    Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
    Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
    Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
    Must yield to such inevitable shame
    As to offend, himself being offended;
    So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
    More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
    I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
    A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?

BASSANIO

    This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
    To excuse the current of thy cruelty.

SHYLOCK

    I am not bound to please thee with my answers.

BASSANIO

    Do all men kill the things they do not love?

SHYLOCK

    Hates any man the thing he would not kill?

BASSANIO

    Every offence is not a hate at first.

SHYLOCK

    What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?

ANTONIO

    I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
    You may as well go stand upon the beach
    And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
    You may as well use question with the wolf
    Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
    You may as well forbid the mountain pines
    To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
    When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
    You may as well do anything most hard,
    As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
    His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
    Make no more offers, use no farther means,
    But with all brief and plain conveniency
    Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.

BASSANIO

    For thy three thousand ducats here is six.

SHYLOCK

    What judgment shall I dread, doing
    Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
    I would not draw them; I would have my bond.

DUKE

    How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?

SHYLOCK

    What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
    You have among you many a purchased slave,
    Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
    You use in abject and in slavish parts,
    Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
    Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
    Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
    Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
    Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
    'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
    The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
    Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
    If you deny me, fie upon your law!
    There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
    I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?

DUKE

    Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
    Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
    Whom I have sent for to determine this,
    Come here to-day.

SALERIO

    My lord, here stays without
    A messenger with letters from the doctor,
    New come from Padua.

DUKE

    Bring us the letter; call the messenger.

BASSANIO

    Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
    The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
    Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.

ANTONIO

    I am a tainted wether of the flock,
    Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
    Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
    You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
    Than to live still and write mine epitaph.

    Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk

DUKE

    Came you from Padua, from Bellario?

NERISSA

    From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.

    Presenting a letter

BASSANIO

    Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?

SHYLOCK

    To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.

GRATIANO

    Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
    Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
    No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
    Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?

SHYLOCK

    No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.

GRATIANO

    O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
    And for thy life let justice be accused.
    Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
    To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
    That souls of animals infuse themselves
    Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
    Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
    Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
    And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
    Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
    Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.

SHYLOCK

    Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
    Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
    Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
    To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.

DUKE

    This letter from Bellario doth commend
    A young and learned doctor to our court.
    Where is he?

NERISSA

    He attendeth here hard by,
    To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.

DUKE

    With all my heart. Some three or four of you
    Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
    Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.

Clerk

    [Reads]
    Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
    your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
    your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
    me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
    acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
    the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
    many books together: he is furnished with my
    opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
    greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
    with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
    request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
    years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
    estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
    old a head. I leave him to your gracious
    acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
    commendation.

DUKE

    You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
    And here, I take it, is the doctor come.

    Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws
    Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?

PORTIA

    I did, my lord.

DUKE

    You are welcome: take your place.
    Are you acquainted with the difference
    That holds this present question in the court?

PORTIA

    I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
    Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?

DUKE

    Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.

PORTIA

    Is your name Shylock?

SHYLOCK

    Shylock is my name.

PORTIA

    Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
    Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
    Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
    You stand within his danger, do you not?

ANTONIO

    Ay, so he says.

PORTIA

    Do you confess the bond?

ANTONIO

    I do.

PORTIA

    Then must the Jew be merciful.

SHYLOCK

    On what compulsion must I? tell me that.

PORTIA

    The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
    It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
    Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
    It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
    'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
    The throned monarch better than his crown;
    His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
    The attribute to awe and majesty,
    Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
    But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
    It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
    It is an attribute to God himself;
    And earthly power doth then show likest God's
    When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
    Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
    That, in the course of justice, none of us
    Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
    And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
    The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
    To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
    Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
    Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.

SHYLOCK

    My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
    The penalty and forfeit of my bond.

PORTIA

    Is he not able to discharge the money?

BASSANIO

    Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
    Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
    I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
    On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
    If this will not suffice, it must appear
    That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
    Wrest once the law to your authority:
    To do a great right, do a little wrong,
    And curb this cruel devil of his will.

PORTIA

    It must not be; there is no power in Venice
    Can alter a decree established:
    'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
    And many an error by the same example
    Will rush into the state: it cannot be.

SHYLOCK

    A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
    O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!

PORTIA

    I pray you, let me look upon the bond.

SHYLOCK

    Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.

PORTIA

    Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.

SHYLOCK

    An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
    Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
    No, not for Venice.

PORTIA

    Why, this bond is forfeit;
    And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
    A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
    Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
    Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.

SHYLOCK

    When it is paid according to the tenor.
    It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
    You know the law, your exposition
    Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
    Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
    Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
    There is no power in the tongue of man
    To alter me: I stay here on my bond.

ANTONIO

    Most heartily I do beseech the court
    To give the judgment.

PORTIA

    Why then, thus it is:
    You must prepare your bosom for his knife.

SHYLOCK

    O noble judge! O excellent young man!

PORTIA

    For the intent and purpose of the law
    Hath full relation to the penalty,
    Which here appeareth due upon the bond.

SHYLOCK

    'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
    How much more elder art thou than thy looks!

PORTIA

    Therefore lay bare your bosom.

SHYLOCK

    Ay, his breast:
    So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
    'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.

PORTIA

    It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
    The flesh?

SHYLOCK

    I have them ready.

PORTIA

    Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
    To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.

SHYLOCK

    Is it so nominated in the bond?

PORTIA

    It is not so express'd: but what of that?
    'Twere good you do so much for charity.

SHYLOCK

    I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.

PORTIA

    You, merchant, have you any thing to say?

ANTONIO

    But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
    Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
    Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
    For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
    Than is her custom: it is still her use
    To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
    To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
    An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
    Of such misery doth she cut me off.
    Commend me to your honourable wife:
    Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
    Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
    And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
    Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
    Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
    And he repents not that he pays your debt;
    For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
    I'll pay it presently with all my heart.

BASSANIO

    Antonio, I am married to a wife
    Which is as dear to me as life itself;
    But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
    Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
    I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
    Here to this devil, to deliver you.

PORTIA

    Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
    If she were by, to hear you make the offer.

GRATIANO

    I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
    I would she were in heaven, so she could
    Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.

NERISSA

    'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
    The wish would make else an unquiet house.

SHYLOCK

    These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
    Would any of the stock of Barrabas
    Had been her husband rather than a Christian!

    Aside
    We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.

PORTIA

    A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
    The court awards it, and the law doth give it.

SHYLOCK

    Most rightful judge!

PORTIA

    And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
    The law allows it, and the court awards it.

SHYLOCK

    Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!

PORTIA

    Tarry a little; there is something else.
    This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
    The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
    Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
    But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
    One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
    Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
    Unto the state of Venice.

GRATIANO

    O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!

SHYLOCK

    Is that the law?

PORTIA

    Thyself shalt see the act:
    For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
    Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.

GRATIANO

    O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!

SHYLOCK

    I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
    And let the Christian go.

BASSANIO

    Here is the money.

PORTIA

    Soft!
    The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
    He shall have nothing but the penalty.

GRATIANO

    O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!

PORTIA

    Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
    Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
    But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
    Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
    As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
    Or the division of the twentieth part
    Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
    But in the estimation of a hair,
    Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.

GRATIANO

    A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
    Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.

PORTIA

    Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.

SHYLOCK

    Give me my principal, and let me go.

BASSANIO

    I have it ready for thee; here it is.

PORTIA

    He hath refused it in the open court:
    He shall have merely justice and his bond.

GRATIANO

    A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
    I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.

SHYLOCK

    Shall I not have barely my principal?

PORTIA

    Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
    To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.

SHYLOCK

    Why, then the devil give him good of it!
    I'll stay no longer question.

PORTIA

    Tarry, Jew:
    The law hath yet another hold on you.
    It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
    If it be proved against an alien
    That by direct or indirect attempts
    He seek the life of any citizen,
    The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
    Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
    Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
    And the offender's life lies in the mercy
    Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
    In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
    For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
    That indirectly and directly too
    Thou hast contrived against the very life
    Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
    The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
    Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.

GRATIANO

    Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
    And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
    Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
    Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.

DUKE

    That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
    I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
    For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
    The other half comes to the general state,
    Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.

PORTIA

    Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.

SHYLOCK

    Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
    You take my house when you do take the prop
    That doth sustain my house; you take my life
    When you do take the means whereby I live.

PORTIA

    What mercy can you render him, Antonio?

GRATIANO

    A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.

ANTONIO

    So please my lord the duke and all the court
    To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
    I am content; so he will let me have
    The other half in use, to render it,
    Upon his death, unto the gentleman
    That lately stole his daughter:
    Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
    He presently become a Christian;
    The other, that he do record a gift,
    Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
    Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.

DUKE

    He shall do this, or else I do recant
    The pardon that I late pronounced here.

PORTIA

    Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?

SHYLOCK

    I am content.

PORTIA

    Clerk, draw a deed of gift.

SHYLOCK

    I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
    I am not well: send the deed after me,
    And I will sign it.

DUKE

    Get thee gone, but do it.

GRATIANO

    In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
    Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
    To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.

    Exit SHYLOCK

DUKE

    Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.

PORTIA

    I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
    I must away this night toward Padua,
    And it is meet I presently set forth.

DUKE

    I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
    Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
    For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.

    Exeunt Duke and his train

BASSANIO

    Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
    Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
    Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
    Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
    We freely cope your courteous pains withal.

ANTONIO

    And stand indebted, over and above,
    In love and service to you evermore.

PORTIA

    He is well paid that is well satisfied;
    And I, delivering you, am satisfied
    And therein do account myself well paid:
    My mind was never yet more mercenary.
    I pray you, know me when we meet again:
    I wish you well, and so I take my leave.

BASSANIO

    Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
    Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
    Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
    Not to deny me, and to pardon me.

PORTIA

    You press me far, and therefore I will yield.

    To ANTONIO
    Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;

    To BASSANIO
    And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
    Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
    And you in love shall not deny me this.

BASSANIO

    This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
    I will not shame myself to give you this.

PORTIA

    I will have nothing else but only this;
    And now methinks I have a mind to it.

BASSANIO

    There's more depends on this than on the value.
    The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
    And find it out by proclamation:
    Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.

PORTIA

    I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
    You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
    You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.

BASSANIO

    Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
    And when she put it on, she made me vow
    That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.

PORTIA

    That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
    An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
    And know how well I have deserved the ring,
    She would not hold out enemy for ever,
    For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!

    Exeunt Portia and Nerissa

ANTONIO

    My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
    Let his deservings and my love withal
    Be valued against your wife's commandment.

BASSANIO

    Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
    Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
    Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.

    Exit Gratiano
    Come, you and I will thither presently;
    And in the morning early will we both
    Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. A street.

    Enter PORTIA and NERISSA

PORTIA

    Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
    And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
    And be a day before our husbands home:
    This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.

    Enter GRATIANO

GRATIANO

    Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en
    My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
    Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
    Your company at dinner.

PORTIA

    That cannot be:
    His ring I do accept most thankfully:
    And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
    I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.

GRATIANO

    That will I do.

NERISSA

    Sir, I would speak with you.

    Aside to PORTIA
    I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
    Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.

PORTIA

    [Aside to NERISSA] Thou mayst, I warrant.
    We shall have old swearing
    That they did give the rings away to men;
    But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.

    Aloud
    Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.

NERISSA

    Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.

    Enter LORENZO and JESSICA

LORENZO

    The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,
    When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
    And they did make no noise, in such a night
    Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
    And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
    Where Cressid lay that night.

JESSICA

    In such a night
    Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
    And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
    And ran dismay'd away.

LORENZO

    In such a night
    Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
    Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
    To come again to Carthage.

JESSICA

    In such a night
    Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
    That did renew old AEson.

LORENZO

    In such a night
    Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
    And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
    As far as Belmont.

JESSICA

    In such a night
    Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
    Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
    And ne'er a true one.

LORENZO

    In such a night
    Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
    Slander her love, and he forgave it her.

JESSICA

    I would out-night you, did no body come;
    But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.

    Enter STEPHANO

LORENZO

    Who comes so fast in silence of the night?

STEPHANO

    A friend.

LORENZO

    A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?

STEPHANO

    Stephano is my name; and I bring word
    My mistress will before the break of day
    Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
    By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
    For happy wedlock hours.

LORENZO

    Who comes with her?

STEPHANO

    None but a holy hermit and her maid.
    I pray you, is my master yet return'd?

LORENZO

    He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
    But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
    And ceremoniously let us prepare
    Some welcome for the mistress of the house.

    Enter LAUNCELOT

LAUNCELOT

    Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!

LORENZO

    Who calls?

LAUNCELOT

    Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?
    Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!

LORENZO

    Leave hollaing, man: here.

LAUNCELOT

    Sola! where? where?

LORENZO

    Here.

LAUNCELOT

    Tell him there's a post come from my master, with
    his horn full of good news: my master will be here
    ere morning.

    Exit

LORENZO

    Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
    And yet no matter: why should we go in?
    My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
    Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
    And bring your music forth into the air.

    Exit Stephano
    How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
    Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
    Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
    Become the touches of sweet harmony.
    Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
    Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
    There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
    But in his motion like an angel sings,
    Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
    Such harmony is in immortal souls;
    But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
    Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.

    Enter Musicians
    Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
    With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,
    And draw her home with music.

    Music

JESSICA

    I am never merry when I hear sweet music.

LORENZO

    The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
    For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
    Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
    Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
    Which is the hot condition of their blood;
    If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
    Or any air of music touch their ears,
    You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
    Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
    By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
    Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
    Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
    But music for the time doth change his nature.
    The man that hath no music in himself,
    Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
    Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
    The motions of his spirit are dull as night
    And his affections dark as Erebus:
    Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.

    Enter PORTIA and NERISSA

PORTIA

    That light we see is burning in my hall.
    How far that little candle throws his beams!
    So shines a good deed in a naughty world.

NERISSA

    When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.

PORTIA

    So doth the greater glory dim the less:
    A substitute shines brightly as a king
    Unto the king be by, and then his state
    Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
    Into the main of waters. Music! hark!

NERISSA

    It is your music, madam, of the house.

PORTIA

    Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
    Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.

NERISSA

    Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.

PORTIA

    The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
    When neither is attended, and I think
    The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
    When every goose is cackling, would be thought
    No better a musician than the wren.
    How many things by season season'd are
    To their right praise and true perfection!
    Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion
    And would not be awaked.

    Music ceases

LORENZO

    That is the voice,
    Or I am much deceived, of Portia.

PORTIA

    He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
    By the bad voice.

LORENZO

    Dear lady, welcome home.

PORTIA

    We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
    Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
    Are they return'd?

LORENZO

    Madam, they are not yet;
    But there is come a messenger before,
    To signify their coming.

PORTIA

    Go in, Nerissa;
    Give order to my servants that they take
    No note at all of our being absent hence;
    Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.

    A tucket sounds

LORENZO

    Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
    We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.

PORTIA

    This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
    It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,
    Such as the day is when the sun is hid.

    Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and their followers

BASSANIO

    We should hold day with the Antipodes,
    If you would walk in absence of the sun.

PORTIA

    Let me give light, but let me not be light;
    For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
    And never be Bassanio so for me:
    But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.

BASSANIO

    I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
    This is the man, this is Antonio,
    To whom I am so infinitely bound.

PORTIA

    You should in all sense be much bound to him.
    For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.

ANTONIO

    No more than I am well acquitted of.

PORTIA

    Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
    It must appear in other ways than words,
    Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.

GRATIANO

    [To NERISSA] By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
    In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
    Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
    Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.

PORTIA

    A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?

GRATIANO

    About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
    That she did give me, whose posy was
    For all the world like cutler's poetry
    Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'

NERISSA

    What talk you of the posy or the value?
    You swore to me, when I did give it you,
    That you would wear it till your hour of death
    And that it should lie with you in your grave:
    Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
    You should have been respective and have kept it.
    Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
    The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.

GRATIANO

    He will, an if he live to be a man.

NERISSA

    Ay, if a woman live to be a man.

GRATIANO

    Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
    A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
    No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
    A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:
    I could not for my heart deny it him.

PORTIA

    You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
    To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
    A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
    And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
    I gave my love a ring and made him swear
    Never to part with it; and here he stands;
    I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
    Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
    That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
    You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
    An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.

BASSANIO

    [Aside] Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
    And swear I lost the ring defending it.

GRATIANO

    My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
    Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
    Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
    That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
    And neither man nor master would take aught
    But the two rings.

PORTIA

    What ring gave you my lord?
    Not that, I hope, which you received of me.

BASSANIO

    If I could add a lie unto a fault,
    I would deny it; but you see my finger
    Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.

PORTIA

    Even so void is your false heart of truth.
    By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
    Until I see the ring.

NERISSA

    Nor I in yours
    Till I again see mine.

BASSANIO

    Sweet Portia,
    If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
    If you did know for whom I gave the ring
    And would conceive for what I gave the ring
    And how unwillingly I left the ring,
    When nought would be accepted but the ring,
    You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

PORTIA

    If you had known the virtue of the ring,
    Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
    Or your own honour to contain the ring,
    You would not then have parted with the ring.
    What man is there so much unreasonable,
    If you had pleased to have defended it
    With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
    To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
    Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
    I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.

BASSANIO

    No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
    No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
    Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
    And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
    And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
    Even he that did uphold the very life
    Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
    I was enforced to send it after him;
    I was beset with shame and courtesy;
    My honour would not let ingratitude
    So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
    For, by these blessed candles of the night,
    Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
    The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.

PORTIA

    Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
    Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
    And that which you did swear to keep for me,
    I will become as liberal as you;
    I'll not deny him any thing I have,
    No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
    Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
    Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
    If you do not, if I be left alone,
    Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
    I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.

NERISSA

    And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
    How you do leave me to mine own protection.

GRATIANO

    Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
    For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.

ANTONIO

    I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.

PORTIA

    Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.

BASSANIO

    Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
    And, in the hearing of these many friends,
    I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
    Wherein I see myself--

PORTIA

    Mark you but that!
    In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
    In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
    And there's an oath of credit.

BASSANIO

    Nay, but hear me:
    Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
    I never more will break an oath with thee.

ANTONIO

    I once did lend my body for his wealth;
    Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
    Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
    My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
    Will never more break faith advisedly.

PORTIA

    Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
    And bid him keep it better than the other.

ANTONIO

    Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.

BASSANIO

    By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!

PORTIA

    I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
    For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.

NERISSA

    And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
    For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
    In lieu of this last night did lie with me.

GRATIANO

    Why, this is like the mending of highways
    In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
    What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?

PORTIA

    Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
    Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
    It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
    There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
    Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
    Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
    And even but now return'd; I have not yet
    Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
    And I have better news in store for you
    Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
    There you shall find three of your argosies
    Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
    You shall not know by what strange accident
    I chanced on this letter.

ANTONIO

    I am dumb.

BASSANIO

    Were you the doctor and I knew you not?

GRATIANO

    Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?

NERISSA

    Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
    Unless he live until he be a man.

BASSANIO

    Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
    When I am absent, then lie with my wife.

ANTONIO

    Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
    For here I read for certain that my ships
    Are safely come to road.

PORTIA

    How now, Lorenzo!
    My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.

NERISSA

    Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
    There do I give to you and Jessica,
    From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
    After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.

LORENZO

    Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
    Of starved people.

PORTIA

    It is almost morning,
    And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
    Of these events at full. Let us go in;
    And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
    And we will answer all things faithfully.

GRATIANO

    Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
    That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
    Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
    Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
    But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
    That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
    Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
    So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.

    Exeunt


A Midsummer Night's Dream

ACT I
SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.

    Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and Attendants

THESEUS

    Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
    Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
    Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
    This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
    Like to a step-dame or a dowager
    Long withering out a young man revenue.

HIPPOLYTA

    Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
    Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
    And then the moon, like to a silver bow
    New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
    Of our solemnities.

THESEUS

    Go, Philostrate,
    Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
    Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
    Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
    The pale companion is not for our pomp.

    Exit PHILOSTRATE
    Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
    And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
    But I will wed thee in another key,
    With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.

    Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS

EGEUS

    Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!

THESEUS

    Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?

EGEUS

    Full of vexation come I, with complaint
    Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
    Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
    This man hath my consent to marry her.
    Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
    This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
    Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
    And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
    Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
    With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
    And stolen the impression of her fantasy
    With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
    Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
    Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
    With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
    Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
    To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
    Be it so she; will not here before your grace
    Consent to marry with Demetrius,
    I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
    As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
    Which shall be either to this gentleman
    Or to her death, according to our law
    Immediately provided in that case.

THESEUS

    What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
    To you your father should be as a god;
    One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
    To whom you are but as a form in wax
    By him imprinted and within his power
    To leave the figure or disfigure it.
    Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.

HERMIA

    So is Lysander.

THESEUS

    In himself he is;
    But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
    The other must be held the worthier.

HERMIA

    I would my father look'd but with my eyes.

THESEUS

    Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.

HERMIA

    I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
    I know not by what power I am made bold,
    Nor how it may concern my modesty,
    In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
    But I beseech your grace that I may know
    The worst that may befall me in this case,
    If I refuse to wed Demetrius.

THESEUS

    Either to die the death or to abjure
    For ever the society of men.
    Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
    Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
    Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
    You can endure the livery of a nun,
    For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
    To live a barren sister all your life,
    Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
    Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
    To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
    But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
    Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
    Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.

HERMIA

    So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
    Ere I will my virgin patent up
    Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
    My soul consents not to give sovereignty.

THESEUS

    Take time to pause; and, by the next new moon--
    The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
    For everlasting bond of fellowship--
    Upon that day either prepare to die
    For disobedience to your father's will,
    Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
    Or on Diana's altar to protest
    For aye austerity and single life.

DEMETRIUS

    Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
    Thy crazed title to my certain right.

LYSANDER

    You have her father's love, Demetrius;
    Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.

EGEUS

    Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
    And what is mine my love shall render him.
    And she is mine, and all my right of her
    I do estate unto Demetrius.

LYSANDER

    I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
    As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
    My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
    If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
    And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
    I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
    Why should not I then prosecute my right?
    Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
    Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
    And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
    Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
    Upon this spotted and inconstant man.

THESEUS

    I must confess that I have heard so much,
    And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
    But, being over-full of self-affairs,
    My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
    And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
    I have some private schooling for you both.
    For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
    To fit your fancies to your father's will;
    Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
    Which by no means we may extenuate--
    To death, or to a vow of single life.
    Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
    Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
    I must employ you in some business
    Against our nuptial and confer with you
    Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.

EGEUS

    With duty and desire we follow you.

    Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA

LYSANDER

    How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
    How chance the roses there do fade so fast?

HERMIA

    Belike for want of rain, which I could well
    Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.

LYSANDER

    Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
    Could ever hear by tale or history,
    The course of true love never did run smooth;
    But, either it was different in blood,--

HERMIA

    O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.

LYSANDER

    Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--

HERMIA

    O spite! too old to be engaged to young.

LYSANDER

    Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--

HERMIA

    O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.

LYSANDER

    Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
    War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
    Making it momentany as a sound,
    Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
    Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
    That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
    And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
    The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
    So quick bright things come to confusion.

HERMIA

    If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
    It stands as an edict in destiny:
    Then let us teach our trial patience,
    Because it is a customary cross,
    As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
    Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.

LYSANDER

    A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
    I have a widow aunt, a dowager
    Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
    From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
    And she respects me as her only son.
    There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
    And to that place the sharp Athenian law
    Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
    Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
    And in the wood, a league without the town,
    Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
    To do observance to a morn of May,
    There will I stay for thee.

HERMIA

    My good Lysander!
    I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
    By his best arrow with the golden head,
    By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
    By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
    And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
    When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
    By all the vows that ever men have broke,
    In number more than ever women spoke,
    In that same place thou hast appointed me,
    To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.

LYSANDER

    Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.

    Enter HELENA

HERMIA

    God speed fair Helena! whither away?

HELENA

    Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
    Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
    Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
    More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
    When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
    Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
    Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
    My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
    My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
    Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
    The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
    O, teach me how you look, and with what art
    You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.

HERMIA

    I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.

HELENA

    O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!

HERMIA

    I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

HELENA

    O that my prayers could such affection move!

HERMIA

    The more I hate, the more he follows me.

HELENA

    The more I love, the more he hateth me.

HERMIA

    His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

HELENA

    None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!

HERMIA

    Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
    Lysander and myself will fly this place.
    Before the time I did Lysander see,
    Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
    O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
    That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!

LYSANDER

    Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
    To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
    Her silver visage in the watery glass,
    Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
    A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
    Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.

HERMIA

    And in the wood, where often you and I
    Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
    Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
    There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
    And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
    To seek new friends and stranger companies.
    Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
    And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
    Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
    From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.

LYSANDER

    I will, my Hermia.

    Exit HERMIA
    Helena, adieu:
    As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!

    Exit

HELENA

    How happy some o'er other some can be!
    Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
    But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
    He will not know what all but he do know:
    And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
    So I, admiring of his qualities:
    Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
    Love can transpose to form and dignity:
    Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
    And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
    Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
    Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
    And therefore is Love said to be a child,
    Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
    As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
    So the boy Love is perjured every where:
    For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
    He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
    And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
    So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
    I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
    Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
    Pursue her; and for this intelligence
    If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
    But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
    To have his sight thither and back again.

    Exit

SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.

    Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING

QUINCE

    Is all our company here?

BOTTOM

    You were best to call them generally, man by man,
    according to the scrip.

QUINCE

    Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
    thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
    interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
    wedding-day at night.

BOTTOM

    First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
    on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
    to a point.

QUINCE

    Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
    most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.

BOTTOM

    A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
    merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
    actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.

QUINCE

    Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.

BOTTOM

    Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.

QUINCE

    You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.

BOTTOM

    What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?

QUINCE

    A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.

BOTTOM

    That will ask some tears in the true performing of
    it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
    eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
    measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
    tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
    tear a cat in, to make all split.
    The raging rocks
    And shivering shocks
    Shall break the locks
    Of prison gates;
    And Phibbus' car
    Shall shine from far
    And make and mar
    The foolish Fates.
    This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
    This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
    more condoling.

QUINCE

    Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.

FLUTE

    Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE

    Flute, you must take Thisby on you.

FLUTE

    What is Thisby? a wandering knight?

QUINCE

    It is the lady that Pyramus must love.

FLUTE

    Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.

QUINCE

    That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
    you may speak as small as you will.

BOTTOM

    An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
    speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
    Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
    and lady dear!'

QUINCE

    No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.

BOTTOM

    Well, proceed.

QUINCE

    Robin Starveling, the tailor.

STARVELING

    Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE

    Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
    Tom Snout, the tinker.

SNOUT

    Here, Peter Quince.

QUINCE

    You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
    Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
    hope, here is a play fitted.

SNUG

    Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
    be, give it me, for I am slow of study.

QUINCE

    You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.

BOTTOM

    Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
    do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
    that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
    let him roar again.'

QUINCE

    An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
    the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
    and that were enough to hang us all.

ALL

    That would hang us, every mother's son.

BOTTOM

    I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
    ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
    discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
    voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
    sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
    nightingale.

QUINCE

    You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
    sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
    summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
    therefore you must needs play Pyramus.

BOTTOM

    Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
    to play it in?

QUINCE

    Why, what you will.

BOTTOM

    I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
    beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
    beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
    perfect yellow.

QUINCE

    Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
    then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
    are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
    you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
    and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
    town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
    we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
    company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
    will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
    wants. I pray you, fail me not.

BOTTOM

    We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
    obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.

QUINCE

    At the duke's oak we meet.

BOTTOM

    Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A wood near Athens.

    Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK

PUCK

    How now, spirit! whither wander you?

Fairy

    Over hill, over dale,
    Thorough bush, thorough brier,
    Over park, over pale,
    Thorough flood, thorough fire,
    I do wander everywhere,
    Swifter than the moon's sphere;
    And I serve the fairy queen,
    To dew her orbs upon the green.
    The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
    In their gold coats spots you see;
    Those be rubies, fairy favours,
    In those freckles live their savours:
    I must go seek some dewdrops here
    And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
    Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
    Our queen and all our elves come here anon.

PUCK

    The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
    Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
    For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
    Because that she as her attendant hath
    A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
    She never had so sweet a changeling;
    And jealous Oberon would have the child
    Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
    But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
    Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
    And now they never meet in grove or green,
    By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
    But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
    Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.

Fairy

    Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
    Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
    Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
    That frights the maidens of the villagery;
    Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
    And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
    And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
    Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
    Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
    You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
    Are not you he?

PUCK

    Thou speak'st aright;
    I am that merry wanderer of the night.
    I jest to Oberon and make him smile
    When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
    Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
    And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
    In very likeness of a roasted crab,
    And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
    And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
    The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
    Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
    Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
    And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
    And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
    And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
    A merrier hour was never wasted there.
    But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.

Fairy

    And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!

    Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train; from the other, TITANIA, with hers

OBERON

    Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.

TITANIA

    What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
    I have forsworn his bed and company.

OBERON

    Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?

TITANIA

    Then I must be thy lady: but I know
    When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
    And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
    Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
    To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
    Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
    But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
    Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
    To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
    To give their bed joy and prosperity.

OBERON

    How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
    Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
    Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
    Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
    From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
    And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
    With Ariadne and Antiopa?

TITANIA

    These are the forgeries of jealousy:
    And never, since the middle summer's spring,
    Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
    By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
    Or in the beached margent of the sea,
    To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
    But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
    Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
    As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
    Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
    Have every pelting river made so proud
    That they have overborne their continents:
    The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
    The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
    Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
    The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
    And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
    The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
    And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
    For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
    The human mortals want their winter here;
    No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
    Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
    Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
    That rheumatic diseases do abound:
    And thorough this distemperature we see
    The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
    Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
    And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
    An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
    Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
    The childing autumn, angry winter, change
    Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
    By their increase, now knows not which is which:
    And this same progeny of evils comes
    From our debate, from our dissension;
    We are their parents and original.

OBERON

    Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
    Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
    I do but beg a little changeling boy,
    To be my henchman.

TITANIA

    Set your heart at rest:
    The fairy land buys not the child of me.
    His mother was a votaress of my order:
    And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
    Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
    And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
    Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
    When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
    And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
    Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
    Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
    Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
    To fetch me trifles, and return again,
    As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
    But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
    And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
    And for her sake I will not part with him.

OBERON

    How long within this wood intend you stay?

TITANIA

    Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
    If you will patiently dance in our round
    And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
    If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.

OBERON

    Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.

TITANIA

    Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
    We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.

    Exit TITANIA with her train

OBERON

    Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
    Till I torment thee for this injury.
    My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
    Since once I sat upon a promontory,
    And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
    Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
    That the rude sea grew civil at her song
    And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
    To hear the sea-maid's music.

PUCK

    I remember.

OBERON

    That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
    Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
    Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
    At a fair vestal throned by the west,
    And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
    As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
    But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
    Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
    And the imperial votaress passed on,
    In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
    Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
    It fell upon a little western flower,
    Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
    And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
    Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
    The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
    Will make or man or woman madly dote
    Upon the next live creature that it sees.
    Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
    Ere the leviathan can swim a league.

PUCK

    I'll put a girdle round about the earth
    In forty minutes.

    Exit

OBERON

    Having once this juice,
    I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
    And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
    The next thing then she waking looks upon,
    Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
    On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
    She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
    And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
    As I can take it with another herb,
    I'll make her render up her page to me.
    But who comes here? I am invisible;
    And I will overhear their conference.

    Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him

DEMETRIUS

    I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
    Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
    The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
    Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
    And here am I, and wode within this wood,
    Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
    Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.

HELENA

    You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
    But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
    Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
    And I shall have no power to follow you.

DEMETRIUS

    Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
    Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
    Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?

HELENA

    And even for that do I love you the more.
    I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
    The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
    Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
    Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
    Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
    What worser place can I beg in your love,--
    And yet a place of high respect with me,--
    Than to be used as you use your dog?

DEMETRIUS

    Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
    For I am sick when I do look on thee.

HELENA

    And I am sick when I look not on you.

DEMETRIUS

    You do impeach your modesty too much,
    To leave the city and commit yourself
    Into the hands of one that loves you not;
    To trust the opportunity of night
    And the ill counsel of a desert place
    With the rich worth of your virginity.

HELENA

    Your virtue is my privilege: for that
    It is not night when I do see your face,
    Therefore I think I am not in the night;
    Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
    For you in my respect are all the world:
    Then how can it be said I am alone,
    When all the world is here to look on me?

DEMETRIUS

    I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
    And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.

HELENA

    The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
    Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
    Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
    The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
    Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
    When cowardice pursues and valour flies.

DEMETRIUS

    I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
    Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
    But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.

HELENA

    Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
    You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
    Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
    We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
    We should be wood and were not made to woo.

    Exit DEMETRIUS
    I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
    To die upon the hand I love so well.

    Exit

OBERON

    Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
    Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.

    Re-enter PUCK
    Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.

PUCK

    Ay, there it is.

OBERON

    I pray thee, give it me.
    I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
    Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
    Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
    With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
    There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
    Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
    And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
    Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
    And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
    And make her full of hateful fantasies.
    Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
    A sweet Athenian lady is in love
    With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
    But do it when the next thing he espies
    May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
    By the Athenian garments he hath on.
    Effect it with some care, that he may prove
    More fond on her than she upon her love:
    And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.

PUCK

    Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Another part of the wood.

    Enter TITANIA, with her train

TITANIA

    Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
    Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
    Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
    Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
    To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
    The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
    At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
    Then to your offices and let me rest.

    The Fairies sing
    You spotted snakes with double tongue,
    Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
    Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
    Come not near our fairy queen.
    Philomel, with melody
    Sing in our sweet lullaby;
    Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
    Never harm,
    Nor spell nor charm,
    Come our lovely lady nigh;
    So, good night, with lullaby.
    Weaving spiders, come not here;
    Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
    Beetles black, approach not near;
    Worm nor snail, do no offence.
    Philomel, with melody, & c.

Fairy

    Hence, away! now all is well:
    One aloof stand sentinel.

    Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps

    Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids

OBERON

    What thou seest when thou dost wake,
    Do it for thy true-love take,
    Love and languish for his sake:
    Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
    Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
    In thy eye that shall appear
    When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
    Wake when some vile thing is near.

    Exit

    Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA

LYSANDER

    Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
    And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
    We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
    And tarry for the comfort of the day.

HERMIA

    Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
    For I upon this bank will rest my head.

LYSANDER

    One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
    One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.

HERMIA

    Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
    Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.

LYSANDER

    O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
    Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
    I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
    So that but one heart we can make of it;
    Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
    So then two bosoms and a single troth.
    Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
    For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.

HERMIA

    Lysander riddles very prettily:
    Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
    If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
    But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
    Lie further off; in human modesty,
    Such separation as may well be said
    Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
    So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
    Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!

LYSANDER

    Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
    And then end life when I end loyalty!
    Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!

HERMIA

    With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!

    They sleep

    Enter PUCK

PUCK

    Through the forest have I gone.
    But Athenian found I none,
    On whose eyes I might approve
    This flower's force in stirring love.
    Night and silence.--Who is here?
    Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
    This is he, my master said,
    Despised the Athenian maid;
    And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
    On the dank and dirty ground.
    Pretty soul! she durst not lie
    Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
    Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
    All the power this charm doth owe.
    When thou wakest, let love forbid
    Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
    So awake when I am gone;
    For I must now to Oberon.

    Exit

    Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running

HELENA

    Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.

DEMETRIUS

    I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.

HELENA

    O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.

DEMETRIUS

    Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.

    Exit

HELENA

    O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
    The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
    Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
    For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
    How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
    If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
    No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
    For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
    Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
    Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
    What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
    Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
    But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
    Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
    Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.

LYSANDER

    [Awaking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
    Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
    That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
    Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
    Is that vile name to perish on my sword!

HELENA

    Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
    What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
    Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.

LYSANDER

    Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
    The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
    Not Hermia but Helena I love:
    Who will not change a raven for a dove?
    The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
    And reason says you are the worthier maid.
    Things growing are not ripe until their season
    So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
    And touching now the point of human skill,
    Reason becomes the marshal to my will
    And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
    Love's stories written in love's richest book.

HELENA

    Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
    When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
    Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
    That I did never, no, nor never can,
    Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
    But you must flout my insufficiency?
    Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
    In such disdainful manner me to woo.
    But fare you well: perforce I must confess
    I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
    O, that a lady, of one man refused.
    Should of another therefore be abused!

    Exit

LYSANDER

    She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:
    And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
    For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
    The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
    Or as tie heresies that men do leave
    Are hated most of those they did deceive,
    So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
    Of all be hated, but the most of me!
    And, all my powers, address your love and might
    To honour Helen and to be her knight!

    Exit

HERMIA

    [Awaking] Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best
    To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
    Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
    Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
    Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
    And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
    Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
    What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
    Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;
    Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
    No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
    Either death or you I'll find immediately.

ACT III
SCENE I. The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.

    Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING

BOTTOM

    Are we all met?

QUINCE

    Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
    for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
    stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
    will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.

BOTTOM

    Peter Quince,--

QUINCE

    What sayest thou, bully Bottom?

BOTTOM

    There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
    Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
    draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
    cannot abide. How answer you that?

SNOUT

    By'r lakin, a parlous fear.

STARVELING

    I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.

BOTTOM

    Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
    Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
    say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
    Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
    better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
    Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
    out of fear.

QUINCE

    Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
    written in eight and six.

BOTTOM

    No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.

SNOUT

    Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?

STARVELING

    I fear it, I promise you.

BOTTOM

    Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
    bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
    most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
    wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
    look to 't.

SNOUT

    Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.

BOTTOM

    Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
    be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
    must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
    defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
    You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
    entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
    for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
    were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
    man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
    his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.

QUINCE

    Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
    that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
    you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.

SNOUT

    Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?

BOTTOM

    A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
    out moonshine, find out moonshine.

QUINCE

    Yes, it doth shine that night.

BOTTOM

    Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
    chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
    may shine in at the casement.

QUINCE

    Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
    and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
    present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
    another thing: we must have a wall in the great
    chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
    talk through the chink of a wall.

SNOUT

    You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?

BOTTOM

    Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
    have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
    about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
    fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
    and Thisby whisper.

QUINCE

    If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,
    every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
    Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
    speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
    according to his cue.

    Enter PUCK behind

PUCK

    What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
    So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
    What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
    An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.

QUINCE

    Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.

BOTTOM

    Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--

QUINCE

    Odours, odours.

BOTTOM

    --odours savours sweet:
    So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
    But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
    And by and by I will to thee appear.

    Exit

PUCK

    A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.

    Exit

FLUTE

    Must I speak now?

QUINCE

    Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes
    but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.

FLUTE

    Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
    Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
    Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
    As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
    I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.

QUINCE

    'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that
    yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
    part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue
    is past; it is, 'never tire.'

FLUTE

    O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
    never tire.

    Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head

BOTTOM

    If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.

QUINCE

    O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,
    masters! fly, masters! Help!

    Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING

PUCK

    I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,
    Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:
    Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
    A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
    And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
    Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.

    Exit

BOTTOM

    Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
    make me afeard.

    Re-enter SNOUT

SNOUT

    O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?

BOTTOM

    What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do
    you?

    Exit SNOUT

    Re-enter QUINCE

QUINCE

    Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art
    translated.

    Exit

BOTTOM

    I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
    to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir
    from this place, do what they can: I will walk up
    and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
    I am not afraid.

    Sings
    The ousel cock so black of hue,
    With orange-tawny bill,
    The throstle with his note so true,
    The wren with little quill,--

TITANIA

    [Awaking] What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?

BOTTOM

    [Sings]
    The finch, the sparrow and the lark,
    The plain-song cuckoo gray,
    Whose note full many a man doth mark,
    And dares not answer nay;--
    for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish
    a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry
    'cuckoo' never so?

TITANIA

    I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
    Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
    So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
    And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
    On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.

BOTTOM

    Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
    for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
    love keep little company together now-a-days; the
    more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
    make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.

TITANIA

    Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.

BOTTOM

    Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
    of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.

TITANIA

    Out of this wood do not desire to go:
    Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
    I am a spirit of no common rate;
    The summer still doth tend upon my state;
    And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
    I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
    And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
    And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
    And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
    That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
    Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!

    Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED

PEASEBLOSSOM

    Ready.

COBWEB

    And I.

MOTH

    And I.

MUSTARDSEED

    And I.

ALL

    Where shall we go?

TITANIA

    Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
    Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
    Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
    With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
    The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
    And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
    And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
    To have my love to bed and to arise;
    And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
    To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
    Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.

PEASEBLOSSOM

    Hail, mortal!

COBWEB

    Hail!

MOTH

    Hail!

MUSTARDSEED

    Hail!

BOTTOM

    I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your
    worship's name.

COBWEB

    Cobweb.

BOTTOM

    I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
    Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with
    you. Your name, honest gentleman?

PEASEBLOSSOM

    Peaseblossom.

BOTTOM

    I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your
    mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good
    Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more
    acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?

MUSTARDSEED

    Mustardseed.

BOTTOM

    Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:
    that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath
    devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
    you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
    desire your more acquaintance, good Master
    Mustardseed.

TITANIA

    Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
    The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
    And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
    Lamenting some enforced chastity.
    Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Another part of the wood.

    Enter OBERON

OBERON

    I wonder if Titania be awaked;
    Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
    Which she must dote on in extremity.

    Enter PUCK
    Here comes my messenger.
    How now, mad spirit!
    What night-rule now about this haunted grove?

PUCK

    My mistress with a monster is in love.
    Near to her close and consecrated bower,
    While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
    A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
    That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
    Were met together to rehearse a play
    Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
    The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
    Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
    Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
    When I did him at this advantage take,
    An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
    Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
    And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
    As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
    Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
    Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
    Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
    So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
    And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
    He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
    Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
    thus strong,
    Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
    For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
    Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
    things catch.
    I led them on in this distracted fear,
    And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
    When in that moment, so it came to pass,
    Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.

OBERON

    This falls out better than I could devise.
    But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
    With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?

PUCK

    I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--
    And the Athenian woman by his side:
    That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.

    Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS

OBERON

    Stand close: this is the same Athenian.

PUCK

    This is the woman, but not this the man.

DEMETRIUS

    O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
    Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.

HERMIA

    Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
    For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
    If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
    Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
    And kill me too.
    The sun was not so true unto the day
    As he to me: would he have stolen away
    From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
    This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
    May through the centre creep and so displease
    Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
    It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
    So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.

DEMETRIUS

    So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
    Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
    Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
    As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.

HERMIA

    What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
    Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?

DEMETRIUS

    I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.

HERMIA

    Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds
    Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
    Henceforth be never number'd among men!
    O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
    Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
    And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
    Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
    An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
    Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.

DEMETRIUS

    You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
    I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
    Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.

HERMIA

    I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.

DEMETRIUS

    An if I could, what should I get therefore?

HERMIA

    A privilege never to see me more.
    And from thy hated presence part I so:
    See me no more, whether he be dead or no.

    Exit

DEMETRIUS

    There is no following her in this fierce vein:
    Here therefore for a while I will remain.
    So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
    For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
    Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
    If for his tender here I make some stay.

    Lies down and sleeps

OBERON

    What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
    And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
    Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
    Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.

PUCK

    Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
    A million fail, confounding oath on oath.

OBERON

    About the wood go swifter than the wind,
    And Helena of Athens look thou find:
    All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
    With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:
    By some illusion see thou bring her here:
    I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.

PUCK

    I go, I go; look how I go,
    Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.

    Exit

OBERON

    Flower of this purple dye,
    Hit with Cupid's archery,
    Sink in apple of his eye.
    When his love he doth espy,
    Let her shine as gloriously
    As the Venus of the sky.
    When thou wakest, if she be by,
    Beg of her for remedy.

    Re-enter PUCK

PUCK

    Captain of our fairy band,
    Helena is here at hand;
    And the youth, mistook by me,
    Pleading for a lover's fee.
    Shall we their fond pageant see?
    Lord, what fools these mortals be!

OBERON

    Stand aside: the noise they make
    Will cause Demetrius to awake.

PUCK

    Then will two at once woo one;
    That must needs be sport alone;
    And those things do best please me
    That befal preposterously.

    Enter LYSANDER and HELENA

LYSANDER

    Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
    Scorn and derision never come in tears:
    Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
    In their nativity all truth appears.
    How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
    Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?

HELENA

    You do advance your cunning more and more.
    When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
    These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
    Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
    Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
    Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.

LYSANDER

    I had no judgment when to her I swore.

HELENA

    Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.

LYSANDER

    Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.

DEMETRIUS

    [Awaking] O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
    To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
    Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
    Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
    That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
    Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
    When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss
    This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!

HELENA

    O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
    To set against me for your merriment:
    If you we re civil and knew courtesy,
    You would not do me thus much injury.
    Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
    But you must join in souls to mock me too?
    If you were men, as men you are in show,
    You would not use a gentle lady so;
    To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
    When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
    You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
    And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
    A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
    To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
    With your derision! none of noble sort
    Would so offend a virgin, and extort
    A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.

LYSANDER

    You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
    For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
    And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
    In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
    And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
    Whom I do love and will do till my death.

HELENA

    Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

DEMETRIUS

    Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
    If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
    My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
    And now to Helen is it home return'd,
    There to remain.

LYSANDER

    Helen, it is not so.

DEMETRIUS

    Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
    Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
    Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.

    Re-enter HERMIA

HERMIA

    Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
    The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
    Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
    It pays the hearing double recompense.
    Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
    Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
    But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?

LYSANDER

    Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?

HERMIA

    What love could press Lysander from my side?

LYSANDER

    Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
    Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
    Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
    Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,
    The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?

HERMIA

    You speak not as you think: it cannot be.

HELENA

    Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
    Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
    To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
    Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
    Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
    To bait me with this foul derision?
    Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
    The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
    When we have chid the hasty-footed time
    For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
    All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
    We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
    Have with our needles created both one flower,
    Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
    Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
    As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
    Had been incorporate. So we grow together,
    Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
    But yet an union in partition;
    Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
    So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
    Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
    Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
    And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
    To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
    It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
    Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
    Though I alone do feel the injury.

HERMIA

    I am amazed at your passionate words.
    I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.

HELENA

    Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
    To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
    And made your other love, Demetrius,
    Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
    To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
    Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
    To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
    Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
    And tender me, forsooth, affection,
    But by your setting on, by your consent?
    What thought I be not so in grace as you,
    So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
    But miserable most, to love unloved?
    This you should pity rather than despise.

HERNIA

    I understand not what you mean by this.

HELENA

    Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
    Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
    Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
    This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
    If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
    You would not make me such an argument.
    But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
    Which death or absence soon shall remedy.

LYSANDER

    Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
    My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!

HELENA

    O excellent!

HERMIA

    Sweet, do not scorn her so.

DEMETRIUS

    If she cannot entreat, I can compel.

LYSANDER

    Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
    Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
    Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
    I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
    To prove him false that says I love thee not.

DEMETRIUS

    I say I love thee more than he can do.

LYSANDER

    If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.

DEMETRIUS

    Quick, come!

HERMIA

    Lysander, whereto tends all this?

LYSANDER

    Away, you Ethiope!

DEMETRIUS

    No, no; he'll [ ]
    Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
    But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!

LYSANDER

    Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
    Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!

HERMIA

    Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
    Sweet love,--

LYSANDER

    Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
    Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!

HERMIA

    Do you not jest?

HELENA

    Yes, sooth; and so do you.

LYSANDER

    Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.

DEMETRIUS

    I would I had your bond, for I perceive
    A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.

LYSANDER

    What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
    Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.

HERMIA

    What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
    Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
    Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
    I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
    Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
    me:
    Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
    In earnest, shall I say?

LYSANDER

    Ay, by my life;
    And never did desire to see thee more.
    Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
    Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
    That I do hate thee and love Helena.

HERMIA

    O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
    You thief of love! what, have you come by night
    And stolen my love's heart from him?

HELENA

    Fine, i'faith!
    Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
    No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
    Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
    Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!

HERMIA

    Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
    Now I perceive that she hath made compare
    Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
    And with her personage, her tall personage,
    Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
    And are you grown so high in his esteem;
    Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
    How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
    How low am I? I am not yet so low
    But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.

HELENA

    I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
    Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
    I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
    I am a right maid for my cowardice:
    Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
    Because she is something lower than myself,
    That I can match her.

HERMIA

    Lower! hark, again.

HELENA

    Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
    I evermore did love you, Hermia,
    Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
    Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
    I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
    He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
    But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
    To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
    And now, so you will let me quiet go,
    To Athens will I bear my folly back
    And follow you no further: let me go:
    You see how simple and how fond I am.

HERMIA

    Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?

HELENA

    A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.

HERMIA

    What, with Lysander?

HELENA

    With Demetrius.

LYSANDER

    Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.

DEMETRIUS

    No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.

HELENA

    O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
    She was a vixen when she went to school;
    And though she be but little, she is fierce.

HERMIA

    'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
    Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
    Let me come to her.

LYSANDER

    Get you gone, you dwarf;
    You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;
    You bead, you acorn.

DEMETRIUS

    You are too officious
    In her behalf that scorns your services.
    Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
    Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
    Never so little show of love to her,
    Thou shalt aby it.

LYSANDER

    Now she holds me not;
    Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
    Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.

DEMETRIUS

    Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.

    Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS

HERMIA

    You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:
    Nay, go not back.

HELENA

    I will not trust you, I,
    Nor longer stay in your curst company.
    Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
    My legs are longer though, to run away.

    Exit

HERMIA

    I am amazed, and know not what to say.

    Exit

OBERON

    This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,
    Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.

PUCK

    Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
    Did not you tell me I should know the man
    By the Athenian garment be had on?
    And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
    That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
    And so far am I glad it so did sort
    As this their jangling I esteem a sport.

OBERON

    Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
    Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
    The starry welkin cover thou anon
    With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
    And lead these testy rivals so astray
    As one come not within another's way.
    Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
    Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
    And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
    And from each other look thou lead them thus,
    Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
    With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
    Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
    Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
    To take from thence all error with his might,
    And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
    When they next wake, all this derision
    Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
    And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
    With league whose date till death shall never end.
    Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
    I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
    And then I will her charmed eye release
    From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.

PUCK

    My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
    For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
    And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;
    At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
    Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
    That in crossways and floods have burial,
    Already to their wormy beds are gone;
    For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
    They willfully themselves exile from light
    And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.

OBERON

    But we are spirits of another sort:
    I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
    And, like a forester, the groves may tread,
    Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
    Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
    Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
    But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
    We may effect this business yet ere day.

    Exit

PUCK

    Up and down, up and down,
    I will lead them up and down:
    I am fear'd in field and town:
    Goblin, lead them up and down.
    Here comes one.

    Re-enter LYSANDER

LYSANDER

    Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.

PUCK

    Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?

LYSANDER

    I will be with thee straight.

PUCK

    Follow me, then,
    To plainer ground.

    Exit LYSANDER, as following the voice

    Re-enter DEMETRIUS

DEMETRIUS

    Lysander! speak again:
    Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
    Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?

PUCK

    Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
    Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
    And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
    I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
    That draws a sword on thee.

DEMETRIUS

    Yea, art thou there?

PUCK

    Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.

    Exeunt

    Re-enter LYSANDER

LYSANDER

    He goes before me and still dares me on:
    When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
    The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
    I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;
    That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
    And here will rest me.

    Lies down
    Come, thou gentle day!
    For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
    I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.

    Sleeps

    Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS

PUCK

    Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?

DEMETRIUS

    Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot
    Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
    And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
    Where art thou now?

PUCK

    Come hither: I am here.

DEMETRIUS

    Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
    If ever I thy face by daylight see:
    Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
    To measure out my length on this cold bed.
    By day's approach look to be visited.

    Lies down and sleeps

    Re-enter HELENA

HELENA

    O weary night, O long and tedious night,
    Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,
    That I may back to Athens by daylight,
    From these that my poor company detest:
    And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
    Steal me awhile from mine own company.

    Lies down and sleeps

PUCK

    Yet but three? Come one more;
    Two of both kinds make up four.
    Here she comes, curst and sad:
    Cupid is a knavish lad,
    Thus to make poor females mad.

    Re-enter HERMIA

HERMIA

    Never so weary, never so in woe,
    Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
    I can no further crawl, no further go;
    My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
    Here will I rest me till the break of day.
    Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!

    Lies down and sleeps

PUCK

    On the ground
    Sleep sound:
    I'll apply
    To your eye,
    Gentle lover, remedy.

    Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes
    When thou wakest,
    Thou takest
    True delight
    In the sight
    Of thy former lady's eye:
    And the country proverb known,
    That every man should take his own,
    In your waking shall be shown:
    Jack shall have Jill;
    Nought shall go ill;
    The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

ACT IV
SCENE I. The same. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA

    lying asleep.

    Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, MUSTARDSEED, and other Fairies attending; OBERON behind unseen

TITANIA

    Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
    While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
    And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
    And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.

BOTTOM

    Where's Peaseblossom?

PEASEBLOSSOM

    Ready.

BOTTOM

    Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?

COBWEB

    Ready.

BOTTOM

    Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your
    weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped
    humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good
    mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
    yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,
    good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;
    I would be loath to have you overflown with a
    honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?

MUSTARDSEED

    Ready.

BOTTOM

    Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,
    leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.

MUSTARDSEED

    What's your Will?

BOTTOM

    Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb
    to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for
    methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
    am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,
    I must scratch.

TITANIA

    What, wilt thou hear some music,
    my sweet love?

BOTTOM

    I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have
    the tongs and the bones.

TITANIA

    Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.

BOTTOM

    Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good
    dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
    of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.

TITANIA

    I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
    The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.

BOTTOM

    I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
    But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
    have an exposition of sleep come upon me.

TITANIA

    Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
    Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.

    Exeunt fairies
    So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
    Gently entwist; the female ivy so
    Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
    O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!

    They sleep

    Enter PUCK

OBERON

    [Advancing] Welcome, good Robin.
    See'st thou this sweet sight?
    Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
    For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
    Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
    I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
    For she his hairy temples then had rounded
    With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
    And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
    Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
    Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
    Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
    When I had at my pleasure taunted her
    And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
    I then did ask of her her changeling child;
    Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
    To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
    And now I have the boy, I will undo
    This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
    And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
    From off the head of this Athenian swain;
    That, he awaking when the other do,
    May all to Athens back again repair
    And think no more of this night's accidents
    But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
    But first I will release the fairy queen.
    Be as thou wast wont to be;
    See as thou wast wont to see:
    Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
    Hath such force and blessed power.
    Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.

TITANIA

    My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
    Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.

OBERON

    There lies your love.

TITANIA

    How came these things to pass?
    O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!

OBERON

    Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
    Titania, music call; and strike more dead
    Than common sleep of all these five the sense.

TITANIA

    Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!

    Music, still

PUCK

    Now, when thou wakest, with thine
    own fool's eyes peep.

OBERON

    Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,
    And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
    Now thou and I are new in amity,
    And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
    Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
    And bless it to all fair prosperity:
    There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
    Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.

PUCK

    Fairy king, attend, and mark:
    I do hear the morning lark.

OBERON

    Then, my queen, in silence sad,
    Trip we after the night's shade:
    We the globe can compass soon,
    Swifter than the wandering moon.

TITANIA

    Come, my lord, and in our flight
    Tell me how it came this night
    That I sleeping here was found
    With these mortals on the ground.

    Exeunt

    Horns winded within

    Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train

THESEUS

    Go, one of you, find out the forester;
    For now our observation is perform'd;
    And since we have the vaward of the day,
    My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
    Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
    Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.

    Exit an Attendant
    We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
    And mark the musical confusion
    Of hounds and echo in conjunction.

HIPPOLYTA

    I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
    When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
    With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
    Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
    The skies, the fountains, every region near
    Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
    So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.

THESEUS

    My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
    So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
    With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
    Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
    Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
    Each under each. A cry more tuneable
    Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
    In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
    Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?

EGEUS

    My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
    And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
    This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
    I wonder of their being here together.

THESEUS

    No doubt they rose up early to observe
    The rite of May, and hearing our intent,
    Came here in grace our solemnity.
    But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
    That Hermia should give answer of her choice?

EGEUS

    It is, my lord.

THESEUS

    Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.

    Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up
    Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
    Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?

LYSANDER

    Pardon, my lord.

THESEUS

    I pray you all, stand up.
    I know you two are rival enemies:
    How comes this gentle concord in the world,
    That hatred is so far from jealousy,
    To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?

LYSANDER

    My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
    Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
    I cannot truly say how I came here;
    But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
    And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
    I came with Hermia hither: our intent
    Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
    Without the peril of the Athenian law.

EGEUS

    Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
    I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
    They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,
    Thereby to have defeated you and me,
    You of your wife and me of my consent,
    Of my consent that she should be your wife.

DEMETRIUS

    My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
    Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
    And I in fury hither follow'd them,
    Fair Helena in fancy following me.
    But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
    But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
    Melted as the snow, seems to me now
    As the remembrance of an idle gaud
    Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
    And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
    The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
    Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
    Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
    But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
    But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
    Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
    And will for evermore be true to it.

THESEUS

    Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
    Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
    Egeus, I will overbear your will;
    For in the temple by and by with us
    These couples shall eternally be knit:
    And, for the morning now is something worn,
    Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
    Away with us to Athens; three and three,
    We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
    Come, Hippolyta.

    Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train

DEMETRIUS

    These things seem small and undistinguishable,

HERMIA

    Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
    When every thing seems double.

HELENA

    So methinks:
    And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
    Mine own, and not mine own.

DEMETRIUS

    Are you sure
    That we are awake? It seems to me
    That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
    The duke was here, and bid us follow him?

HERMIA

    Yea; and my father.

HELENA

    And Hippolyta.

LYSANDER

    And he did bid us follow to the temple.

DEMETRIUS

    Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him
    And by the way let us recount our dreams.

    Exeunt

BOTTOM

    [Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I will
    answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!
    Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
    the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen
    hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
    vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to
    say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go
    about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there
    is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and
    methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if
    he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye
    of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not
    seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue
    to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream
    was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
    this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,
    because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the
    latter end of a play, before the duke:
    peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall
    sing it at her death.

    Exit

SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.

    Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING

QUINCE

    Have you sent to Bottom's house ? is he come home yet?

STARVELING

    He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is
    transported.

FLUTE

    If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes
    not forward, doth it?

QUINCE

    It is not possible: you have not a man in all
    Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.

FLUTE

    No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
    man in Athens.

QUINCE

    Yea and the best person too; and he is a very
    paramour for a sweet voice.

FLUTE

    You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,
    a thing of naught.

    Enter SNUG

SNUG

    Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and
    there is two or three lords and ladies more married:
    if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made
    men.

FLUTE

    O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a
    day during his life; he could not have 'scaped
    sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him
    sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;
    he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
    Pyramus, or nothing.

    Enter BOTTOM

BOTTOM

    Where are these lads? where are these hearts?

QUINCE

    Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!

BOTTOM

    Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not
    what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
    will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.

QUINCE

    Let us hear, sweet Bottom.

BOTTOM

    Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that
    the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,
    good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
    pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look
    o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our
    play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have
    clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion
    pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the
    lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions
    nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I
    do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
    comedy. No more words: away! go, away!

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Athens. The palace of THESEUS.

    Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and Attendants

HIPPOLYTA

    'Tis strange my Theseus, that these
    lovers speak of.

THESEUS

    More strange than true: I never may believe
    These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
    Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
    Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
    More than cool reason ever comprehends.
    The lunatic, the lover and the poet
    Are of imagination all compact:
    One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
    That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
    Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
    The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
    Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
    And as imagination bodies forth
    The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
    Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
    A local habitation and a name.
    Such tricks hath strong imagination,
    That if it would but apprehend some joy,
    It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
    Or in the night, imagining some fear,
    How easy is a bush supposed a bear!

HIPPOLYTA

    But all the story of the night told over,
    And all their minds transfigured so together,
    More witnesseth than fancy's images
    And grows to something of great constancy;
    But, howsoever, strange and admirable.

THESEUS

    Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.

    Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA
    Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
    Accompany your hearts!

LYSANDER

    More than to us
    Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!

THESEUS

    Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
    To wear away this long age of three hours
    Between our after-supper and bed-time?
    Where is our usual manager of mirth?
    What revels are in hand? Is there no play,
    To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
    Call Philostrate.

PHILOSTRATE

    Here, mighty Theseus.

THESEUS

    Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
    What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
    The lazy time, if not with some delight?

PHILOSTRATE

    There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
    Make choice of which your highness will see first.

    Giving a paper

THESEUS

    [Reads] 'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
    By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
    We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
    In glory of my kinsman Hercules.

    Reads
    'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
    Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
    That is an old device; and it was play'd
    When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.

    Reads
    'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
    Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'
    That is some satire, keen and critical,
    Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.

    Reads
    'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
    And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
    Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
    That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
    How shall we find the concord of this discord?

PHILOSTRATE

    A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
    Which is as brief as I have known a play;
    But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
    Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
    There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
    And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
    For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
    Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
    Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
    The passion of loud laughter never shed.

THESEUS

    What are they that do play it?

PHILOSTRATE

    Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
    Which never labour'd in their minds till now,
    And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
    With this same play, against your nuptial.

THESEUS

    And we will hear it.

PHILOSTRATE

    No, my noble lord;
    It is not for you: I have heard it over,
    And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
    Unless you can find sport in their intents,
    Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
    To do you service.

THESEUS

    I will hear that play;
    For never anything can be amiss,
    When simpleness and duty tender it.
    Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.

    Exit PHILOSTRATE

HIPPOLYTA

    I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
    And duty in his service perishing.

THESEUS

    Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.

HIPPOLYTA

    He says they can do nothing in this kind.

THESEUS

    The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
    Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
    And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
    Takes it in might, not merit.
    Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
    To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
    Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
    Make periods in the midst of sentences,
    Throttle their practised accent in their fears
    And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
    Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
    Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
    And in the modesty of fearful duty
    I read as much as from the rattling tongue
    Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
    Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
    In least speak most, to my capacity.

    Re-enter PHILOSTRATE

PHILOSTRATE

    So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.

THESEUS

    Let him approach.

    Flourish of trumpets

    Enter QUINCE for the Prologue

Prologue

    If we offend, it is with our good will.
    That you should think, we come not to offend,
    But with good will. To show our simple skill,
    That is the true beginning of our end.
    Consider then we come but in despite.
    We do not come as minding to contest you,
    Our true intent is. All for your delight
    We are not here. That you should here repent you,
    The actors are at hand and by their show
    You shall know all that you are like to know.

THESEUS

    This fellow doth not stand upon points.

LYSANDER

    He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
    not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not
    enough to speak, but to speak true.

HIPPOLYTA

    Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
    on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.

THESEUS

    His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing
    impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?

    Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion

Prologue

    Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
    But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
    This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
    This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
    This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
    Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
    And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
    To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
    This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
    Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
    By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
    To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
    This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
    The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
    Did scare away, or rather did affright;
    And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
    Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
    Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
    And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
    Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
    He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
    And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
    His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
    Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
    At large discourse, while here they do remain.

    Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine

THESEUS

    I wonder if the lion be to speak.

DEMETRIUS

    No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.

Wall

    In this same interlude it doth befall
    That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
    And such a wall, as I would have you think,
    That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
    Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
    Did whisper often very secretly.
    This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
    That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
    And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
    Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.

THESEUS

    Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?

DEMETRIUS

    It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
    discourse, my lord.

    Enter Pyramus

THESEUS

    Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!

Pyramus

    O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
    O night, which ever art when day is not!
    O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
    I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
    And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
    That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
    Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
    Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!

    Wall holds up his fingers
    Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
    But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
    O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
    Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!

THESEUS

    The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.

Pyramus

    No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'
    is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
    spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
    fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.

    Enter Thisbe

Thisbe

    O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
    For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
    My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
    Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.

Pyramus

    I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
    To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!

Thisbe

    My love thou art, my love I think.

Pyramus

    Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
    And, like Limander, am I trusty still.

Thisbe

    And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.

Pyramus

    Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.

Thisbe

    As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.

Pyramus

    O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!

Thisbe

    I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.

Pyramus

    Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?

Thisbe

    'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.

    Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe

Wall

    Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
    And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.

    Exit

THESEUS

    Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.

DEMETRIUS

    No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
    without warning.

HIPPOLYTA

    This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.

THESEUS

    The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
    are no worse, if imagination amend them.

HIPPOLYTA

    It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.

THESEUS

    If we imagine no worse of them than they of
    themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
    come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.

    Enter Lion and Moonshine

Lion

    You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
    The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
    May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
    When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
    Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
    A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;
    For, if I should as lion come in strife
    Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.

THESEUS

    A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.

DEMETRIUS

    The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.

LYSANDER

    This lion is a very fox for his valour.

THESEUS

    True; and a goose for his discretion.

DEMETRIUS

    Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
    discretion; and the fox carries the goose.

THESEUS

    His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
    for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
    leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.

Moonshine

    This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--

DEMETRIUS

    He should have worn the horns on his head.

THESEUS

    He is no crescent, and his horns are
    invisible within the circumference.

Moonshine

    This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
    Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.

THESEUS

    This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
    should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
    man i' the moon?

DEMETRIUS

    He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
    see, it is already in snuff.

HIPPOLYTA

    I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!

THESEUS

    It appears, by his small light of discretion, that
    he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all
    reason, we must stay the time.

LYSANDER

    Proceed, Moon.

Moonshine

    All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
    lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this
    thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.

DEMETRIUS

    Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all
    these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.

    Enter Thisbe

Thisbe

    This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?

Lion

    [Roaring] Oh--

    Thisbe runs off

DEMETRIUS

    Well roared, Lion.

THESEUS

    Well run, Thisbe.

HIPPOLYTA

    Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a
    good grace.

    The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit

THESEUS

    Well moused, Lion.

LYSANDER

    And so the lion vanished.

DEMETRIUS

    And then came Pyramus.

    Enter Pyramus

Pyramus

    Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
    I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
    For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
    I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
    But stay, O spite!
    But mark, poor knight,
    What dreadful dole is here!
    Eyes, do you see?
    How can it be?
    O dainty duck! O dear!
    Thy mantle good,
    What, stain'd with blood!
    Approach, ye Furies fell!
    O Fates, come, come,
    Cut thread and thrum;
    Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!

THESEUS

    This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
    go near to make a man look sad.

HIPPOLYTA

    Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.

Pyramus

    O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
    Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
    Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
    That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd
    with cheer.
    Come, tears, confound;
    Out, sword, and wound
    The pap of Pyramus;
    Ay, that left pap,
    Where heart doth hop:

    Stabs himself
    Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
    Now am I dead,
    Now am I fled;
    My soul is in the sky:
    Tongue, lose thy light;
    Moon take thy flight:

    Exit Moonshine
    Now die, die, die, die, die.

    Dies

DEMETRIUS

    No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.

LYSANDER

    Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.

THESEUS

    With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
    prove an ass.

HIPPOLYTA

    How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
    back and finds her lover?

THESEUS

    She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
    her passion ends the play.

    Re-enter Thisbe

HIPPOLYTA

    Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
    Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.

DEMETRIUS

    A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
    Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;
    she for a woman, God bless us.

LYSANDER

    She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.

DEMETRIUS

    And thus she means, videlicet:--

Thisbe

    Asleep, my love?
    What, dead, my dove?
    O Pyramus, arise!
    Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
    Dead, dead? A tomb
    Must cover thy sweet eyes.
    These My lips,
    This cherry nose,
    These yellow cowslip cheeks,
    Are gone, are gone:
    Lovers, make moan:
    His eyes were green as leeks.
    O Sisters Three,
    Come, come to me,
    With hands as pale as milk;
    Lay them in gore,
    Since you have shore
    With shears his thread of silk.
    Tongue, not a word:
    Come, trusty sword;
    Come, blade, my breast imbrue:

    Stabs herself
    And, farewell, friends;
    Thus Thisby ends:
    Adieu, adieu, adieu.

    Dies

THESEUS

    Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.

DEMETRIUS

    Ay, and Wall too.

BOTTOM

    [Starting up] No assure you; the wall is down that
    parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
    epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
    of our company?

THESEUS

    No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no
    excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all
    dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he
    that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
    in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine
    tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably
    discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
    epilogue alone.

    A dance
    The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:
    Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
    I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
    As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
    This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
    The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.
    A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
    In nightly revels and new jollity.

    Exeunt

    Enter PUCK

PUCK

    Now the hungry lion roars,
    And the wolf behowls the moon;
    Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
    All with weary task fordone.
    Now the wasted brands do glow,
    Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
    Puts the wretch that lies in woe
    In remembrance of a shroud.
    Now it is the time of night
    That the graves all gaping wide,
    Every one lets forth his sprite,
    In the church-way paths to glide:
    And we fairies, that do run
    By the triple Hecate's team,
    From the presence of the sun,
    Following darkness like a dream,
    Now are frolic: not a mouse
    Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
    I am sent with broom before,
    To sweep the dust behind the door.

    Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train

OBERON

    Through the house give gathering light,
    By the dead and drowsy fire:
    Every elf and fairy sprite
    Hop as light as bird from brier;
    And this ditty, after me,
    Sing, and dance it trippingly.

TITANIA

    First, rehearse your song by rote
    To each word a warbling note:
    Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
    Will we sing, and bless this place.

    Song and dance

OBERON

    Now, until the break of day,
    Through this house each fairy stray.
    To the best bride-bed will we,
    Which by us shall blessed be;
    And the issue there create
    Ever shall be fortunate.
    So shall all the couples three
    Ever true in loving be;
    And the blots of Nature's hand
    Shall not in their issue stand;
    Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
    Nor mark prodigious, such as are
    Despised in nativity,
    Shall upon their children be.
    With this field-dew consecrate,
    Every fairy take his gait;
    And each several chamber bless,
    Through this palace, with sweet peace;
    And the owner of it blest
    Ever shall in safety rest.
    Trip away; make no stay;
    Meet me all by break of day.

    Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train

PUCK

    If we shadows have offended,
    Think but this, and all is mended,
    That you have but slumber'd here
    While these visions did appear.
    And this weak and idle theme,
    No more yielding but a dream,
    Gentles, do not reprehend:
    if you pardon, we will mend:
    And, as I am an honest Puck,
    If we have unearned luck
    Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
    We will make amends ere long;
    Else the Puck a liar call;
    So, good night unto you all.
    Give me your hands, if we be friends,
    And Robin shall restore amends.


Much Ado About Nothing

ACT I
SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.

    Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a Messenger

LEONATO

    I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
    comes this night to Messina.

Messenger

    He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
    when I left him.

LEONATO

    How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?

Messenger

    But few of any sort, and none of name.

LEONATO

    A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
    home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
    bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.

Messenger

    Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
    Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
    promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
    the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
    bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
    tell you how.

LEONATO

    He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
    glad of it.

Messenger

    I have already delivered him letters, and there
    appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
    not show itself modest enough without a badge of
    bitterness.

LEONATO

    Did he break out into tears?

Messenger

    In great measure.

LEONATO

    A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
    truer than those that are so washed. How much
    better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!

BEATRICE

    I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
    wars or no?

Messenger

    I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
    in the army of any sort.

LEONATO

    What is he that you ask for, niece?

HERO

    My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.

Messenger

    O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.

BEATRICE

    He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
    Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
    the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
    him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
    killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
    he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.

LEONATO

    Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;
    but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.

Messenger

    He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.

BEATRICE

    You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
    he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
    excellent stomach.

Messenger

    And a good soldier too, lady.

BEATRICE

    And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?

Messenger

    A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all
    honourable virtues.

BEATRICE

    It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
    but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.

LEONATO

    You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
    kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
    they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
    between them.

BEATRICE

    Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
    conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
    now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
    he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
    bear it for a difference between himself and his
    horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
    to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
    companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.

Messenger

    Is't possible?

BEATRICE

    Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
    the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
    next block.

Messenger

    I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.

BEATRICE

    No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
    you, who is his companion? Is there no young
    squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?

Messenger

    He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.

BEATRICE

    O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
    is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
    runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
    he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
    thousand pound ere a' be cured.

Messenger

    I will hold friends with you, lady.

BEATRICE

    Do, good friend.

LEONATO

    You will never run mad, niece.

BEATRICE

    No, not till a hot January.

Messenger

    Don Pedro is approached.

    Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and BALTHASAR

DON PEDRO

    Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
    trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
    cost, and you encounter it.

LEONATO

    Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
    your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
    remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
    and happiness takes his leave.

DON PEDRO

    You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
    is your daughter.

LEONATO

    Her mother hath many times told me so.

BENEDICK

    Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?

LEONATO

    Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.

DON PEDRO

    You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
    what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
    herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
    honourable father.

BENEDICK

    If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
    have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
    like him as she is.

BEATRICE

    I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
    Benedick: nobody marks you.

BENEDICK

    What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?

BEATRICE

    Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
    such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
    Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
    in her presence.

BENEDICK

    Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
    am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
    would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
    heart; for, truly, I love none.

BEATRICE

    A dear happiness to women: they would else have
    been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
    and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
    had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
    swear he loves me.

BENEDICK

    God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
    gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
    scratched face.

BEATRICE

    Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
    a face as yours were.

BENEDICK

    Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.

BEATRICE

    A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.

BENEDICK

    I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
    so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
    name; I have done.

BEATRICE

    You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.

DON PEDRO

    That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
    and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
    invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
    the least a month; and he heartily prays some
    occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
    hypocrite, but prays from his heart.

LEONATO

    If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.

    To DON JOHN
    Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
    the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.

DON JOHN

    I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
    you.

LEONATO

    Please it your grace lead on?

DON PEDRO

    Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.

    Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO

CLAUDIO

    Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?

BENEDICK

    I noted her not; but I looked on her.

CLAUDIO

    Is she not a modest young lady?

BENEDICK

    Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
    my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
    after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?

CLAUDIO

    No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.

BENEDICK

    Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
    praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
    for a great praise: only this commendation I can
    afford her, that were she other than she is, she
    were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
    do not like her.

CLAUDIO

    Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
    truly how thou likest her.

BENEDICK

    Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?

CLAUDIO

    Can the world buy such a jewel?

BENEDICK

    Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
    with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
    to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
    rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
    you, to go in the song?

CLAUDIO

    In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
    looked on.

BENEDICK

    I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
    matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
    possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
    as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
    hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?

CLAUDIO

    I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
    contrary, if Hero would be my wife.

BENEDICK

    Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
    one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
    Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
    Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
    into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
    Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.

    Re-enter DON PEDRO

DON PEDRO

    What secret hath held you here, that you followed
    not to Leonato's?

BENEDICK

    I would your grace would constrain me to tell.

DON PEDRO

    I charge thee on thy allegiance.

BENEDICK

    You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb
    man; I would have you think so; but, on my
    allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
    in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
    Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's
    short daughter.

CLAUDIO

    If this were so, so were it uttered.

BENEDICK

    Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor
    'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
    so.'

CLAUDIO

    If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
    should be otherwise.

DON PEDRO

    Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.

CLAUDIO

    You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.

DON PEDRO

    By my troth, I speak my thought.

CLAUDIO

    And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.

BENEDICK

    And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.

CLAUDIO

    That I love her, I feel.

DON PEDRO

    That she is worthy, I know.

BENEDICK

    That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
    know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
    fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.

DON PEDRO

    Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
    of beauty.

CLAUDIO

    And never could maintain his part but in the force
    of his will.

BENEDICK

    That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she
    brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
    thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
    forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
    all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
    them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
    right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which
    I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.

DON PEDRO

    I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.

BENEDICK

    With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,
    not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
    with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
    out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
    up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
    blind Cupid.

DON PEDRO

    Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou
    wilt prove a notable argument.

BENEDICK

    If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
    at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
    the shoulder, and called Adam.

DON PEDRO

    Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull
    doth bear the yoke.'

BENEDICK

    The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
    Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set
    them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
    and in such great letters as they write 'Here is
    good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
    'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'

CLAUDIO

    If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.

DON PEDRO

    Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
    Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.

BENEDICK

    I look for an earthquake too, then.

DON PEDRO

    Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
    meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
    Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
    not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
    great preparation.

BENEDICK

    I have almost matter enough in me for such an
    embassage; and so I commit you--

CLAUDIO

    To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--

DON PEDRO

    The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.

BENEDICK

    Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
    discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
    the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
    you flout old ends any further, examine your
    conscience: and so I leave you.

    Exit

CLAUDIO

    My liege, your highness now may do me good.

DON PEDRO

    My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
    And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
    Any hard lesson that may do thee good.

CLAUDIO

    Hath Leonato any son, my lord?

DON PEDRO

    No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
    Dost thou affect her, Claudio?

CLAUDIO

    O, my lord,
    When you went onward on this ended action,
    I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
    That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
    Than to drive liking to the name of love:
    But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
    Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
    Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
    All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
    Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.

DON PEDRO

    Thou wilt be like a lover presently
    And tire the hearer with a book of words.
    If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
    And I will break with her and with her father,
    And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
    That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?

CLAUDIO

    How sweetly you do minister to love,
    That know love's grief by his complexion!
    But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
    I would have salved it with a longer treatise.

DON PEDRO

    What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
    The fairest grant is the necessity.
    Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
    And I will fit thee with the remedy.
    I know we shall have revelling to-night:
    I will assume thy part in some disguise
    And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
    And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
    And take her hearing prisoner with the force
    And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
    Then after to her father will I break;
    And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
    In practise let us put it presently.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in LEONATO's house.

    Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting

LEONATO

    How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?
    hath he provided this music?

ANTONIO

    He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell
    you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.

LEONATO

    Are they good?

ANTONIO

    As the event stamps them: but they have a good
    cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count
    Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
    orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
    the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
    niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
    this night in a dance: and if he found her
    accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
    top and instantly break with you of it.

LEONATO

    Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?

ANTONIO

    A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
    question him yourself.

LEONATO

    No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear
    itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
    that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
    if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.

    Enter Attendants
    Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you
    mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your
    skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same.

    Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE

CONRADE

    What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out
    of measure sad?

DON JOHN

    There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;
    therefore the sadness is without limit.

CONRADE

    You should hear reason.

DON JOHN

    And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?

CONRADE

    If not a present remedy, at least a patient
    sufferance.

DON JOHN

    I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,
    born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral
    medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
    what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile
    at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait
    for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and
    tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and
    claw no man in his humour.

CONRADE

    Yea, but you must not make the full show of this
    till you may do it without controlment. You have of
    late stood out against your brother, and he hath
    ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is
    impossible you should take true root but by the
    fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
    that you frame the season for your own harvest.

DON JOHN

    I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
    his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
    disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
    love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to
    be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied
    but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
    a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
    have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
    mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do
    my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
    seek not to alter me.

CONRADE

    Can you make no use of your discontent?

DON JOHN

    I make all use of it, for I use it only.
    Who comes here?

    Enter BORACHIO
    What news, Borachio?

BORACHIO

    I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your
    brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
    can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.

DON JOHN

    Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
    What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
    unquietness?

BORACHIO

    Marry, it is your brother's right hand.

DON JOHN

    Who? the most exquisite Claudio?

BORACHIO

    Even he.

DON JOHN

    A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks
    he?

BORACHIO

    Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.

DON JOHN

    A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?

BORACHIO

    Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a
    musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand
    in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
    arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the
    prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
    obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.

DON JOHN

    Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to
    my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the
    glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I
    bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?

CONRADE

    To the death, my lord.

DON JOHN

    Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the
    greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of
    my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?

BORACHIO

    We'll wait upon your lordship.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A hall in LEONATO'S house.

    Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others

LEONATO

    Was not Count John here at supper?

ANTONIO

    I saw him not.

BEATRICE

    How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
    him but I am heart-burned an hour after.

HERO

    He is of a very melancholy disposition.

BEATRICE

    He were an excellent man that were made just in the
    midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
    like an image and says nothing, and the other too
    like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.

LEONATO

    Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
    mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
    Benedick's face,--

BEATRICE

    With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
    enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
    in the world, if a' could get her good-will.

LEONATO

    By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
    husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.

ANTONIO

    In faith, she's too curst.

BEATRICE

    Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's
    sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst
    cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.

LEONATO

    So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.

BEATRICE

    Just, if he send me no husband; for the which
    blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
    evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
    beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.

LEONATO

    You may light on a husband that hath no beard.

BEATRICE

    What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel
    and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
    beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
    beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
    a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
    man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
    sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
    apes into hell.

LEONATO

    Well, then, go you into hell?

BEATRICE

    No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet
    me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
    say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
    heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
    I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
    heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
    there live we as merry as the day is long.

ANTONIO

    [To HERO] Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled
    by your father.

BEATRICE

    Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
    and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all
    that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
    make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please
    me.'

LEONATO

    Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.

BEATRICE

    Not till God make men of some other metal than
    earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
    overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
    an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
    No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;
    and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.

LEONATO

    Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince
    do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.

BEATRICE

    The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be
    not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
    important, tell him there is measure in every thing
    and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:
    wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
    a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
    and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
    fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
    measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
    repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
    cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.

LEONATO

    Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.

BEATRICE

    I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.

LEONATO

    The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.

    All put on their masks

    Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR, DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked

DON PEDRO

    Lady, will you walk about with your friend?

HERO

    So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,
    I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.

DON PEDRO

    With me in your company?

HERO

    I may say so, when I please.

DON PEDRO

    And when please you to say so?

HERO

    When I like your favour; for God defend the lute
    should be like the case!

DON PEDRO

    My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.

HERO

    Why, then, your visor should be thatched.

DON PEDRO

    Speak low, if you speak love.

    Drawing her aside

BALTHASAR

    Well, I would you did like me.

MARGARET

    So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many
    ill-qualities.

BALTHASAR

    Which is one?

MARGARET

    I say my prayers aloud.

BALTHASAR

    I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.

MARGARET

    God match me with a good dancer!

BALTHASAR

    Amen.

MARGARET

    And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is
    done! Answer, clerk.

BALTHASAR

    No more words: the clerk is answered.

URSULA

    I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.

ANTONIO

    At a word, I am not.

URSULA

    I know you by the waggling of your head.

ANTONIO

    To tell you true, I counterfeit him.

URSULA

    You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were
    the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you
    are he, you are he.

ANTONIO

    At a word, I am not.

URSULA

    Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your
    excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,
    mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an
    end.

BEATRICE

    Will you not tell me who told you so?

BENEDICK

    No, you shall pardon me.

BEATRICE

    Nor will you not tell me who you are?

BENEDICK

    Not now.

BEATRICE

    That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit
    out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
    Signior Benedick that said so.

BENEDICK

    What's he?

BEATRICE

    I am sure you know him well enough.

BENEDICK

    Not I, believe me.

BEATRICE

    Did he never make you laugh?

BENEDICK

    I pray you, what is he?

BEATRICE

    Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;
    only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
    none but libertines delight in him; and the
    commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;
    for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
    they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
    the fleet: I would he had boarded me.

BENEDICK

    When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.

BEATRICE

    Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;
    which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
    strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a
    partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
    supper that night.

    Music
    We must follow the leaders.

BENEDICK

    In every good thing.

BEATRICE

    Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at
    the next turning.

    Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO, and CLAUDIO

DON JOHN

    Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
    withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
    The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.

BORACHIO

    And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.

DON JOHN

    Are not you Signior Benedick?

CLAUDIO

    You know me well; I am he.

DON JOHN

    Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:
    he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him
    from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
    do the part of an honest man in it.

CLAUDIO

    How know you he loves her?

DON JOHN

    I heard him swear his affection.

BORACHIO

    So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.

DON JOHN

    Come, let us to the banquet.

    Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO

CLAUDIO

    Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,
    But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
    'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
    Friendship is constant in all other things
    Save in the office and affairs of love:
    Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
    Let every eye negotiate for itself
    And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
    Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
    This is an accident of hourly proof,
    Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!

    Re-enter BENEDICK

BENEDICK

    Count Claudio?

CLAUDIO

    Yea, the same.

BENEDICK

    Come, will you go with me?

CLAUDIO

    Whither?

BENEDICK

    Even to the next willow, about your own business,
    county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
    about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under
    your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear
    it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.

CLAUDIO

    I wish him joy of her.

BENEDICK

    Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they
    sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
    have served you thus?

CLAUDIO

    I pray you, leave me.

BENEDICK

    Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
    boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.

CLAUDIO

    If it will not be, I'll leave you.

    Exit

BENEDICK

    Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
    But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
    know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
    under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
    am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
    is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
    that puts the world into her person and so gives me
    out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.

    Re-enter DON PEDRO

DON PEDRO

    Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?

BENEDICK

    Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
    I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
    warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
    that your grace had got the good will of this young
    lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
    either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
    to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.

DON PEDRO

    To be whipped! What's his fault?

BENEDICK

    The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being
    overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
    companion, and he steals it.

DON PEDRO

    Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
    transgression is in the stealer.

BENEDICK

    Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,
    and the garland too; for the garland he might have
    worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
    you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.

DON PEDRO

    I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to
    the owner.

BENEDICK

    If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,
    you say honestly.

DON PEDRO

    The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
    gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
    wronged by you.

BENEDICK

    O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
    an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
    answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
    scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
    myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
    duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
    with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
    like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
    me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
    if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
    there were no living near her; she would infect to
    the north star. I would not marry her, though she
    were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
    he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
    turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
    the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
    her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
    some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
    she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
    sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
    would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror
    and perturbation follows her.

DON PEDRO

    Look, here she comes.

    Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO

BENEDICK

    Will your grace command me any service to the
    world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now
    to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;
    I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the
    furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of
    Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great
    Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
    rather than hold three words' conference with this
    harpy. You have no employment for me?

DON PEDRO

    None, but to desire your good company.

BENEDICK

    O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot
    endure my Lady Tongue.

    Exit

DON PEDRO

    Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of
    Signior Benedick.

BEATRICE

    Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave
    him use for it, a double heart for his single one:
    marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
    therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.

DON PEDRO

    You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.

BEATRICE

    So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I
    should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
    Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.

DON PEDRO

    Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?

CLAUDIO

    Not sad, my lord.

DON PEDRO

    How then? sick?

CLAUDIO

    Neither, my lord.

BEATRICE

    The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
    well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and
    something of that jealous complexion.

DON PEDRO

    I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;
    though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
    false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
    fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
    and his good will obtained: name the day of
    marriage, and God give thee joy!

LEONATO

    Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my
    fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
    grace say Amen to it.

BEATRICE

    Speak, count, 'tis your cue.

CLAUDIO

    Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
    but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
    you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
    you and dote upon the exchange.

BEATRICE

    Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth
    with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.

DON PEDRO

    In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.

BEATRICE

    Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on
    the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
    ear that he is in her heart.

CLAUDIO

    And so she doth, cousin.

BEATRICE

    Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the
    world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a
    corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!

DON PEDRO

    Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.

BEATRICE

    I would rather have one of your father's getting.
    Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
    father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.

DON PEDRO

    Will you have me, lady?

BEATRICE

    No, my lord, unless I might have another for
    working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
    every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
    was born to speak all mirth and no matter.

DON PEDRO

    Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
    becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
    a merry hour.

BEATRICE

    No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
    was a star danced, and under that was I born.
    Cousins, God give you joy!

LEONATO

    Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?

BEATRICE

    I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.

    Exit

DON PEDRO

    By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.

LEONATO

    There's little of the melancholy element in her, my
    lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and
    not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,
    she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
    herself with laughing.

DON PEDRO

    She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.

LEONATO

    O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.

DON PEDRO

    She were an excellent wife for Benedict.

LEONATO

    O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,
    they would talk themselves mad.

DON PEDRO

    County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?

CLAUDIO

    To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love
    have all his rites.

LEONATO

    Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just
    seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all
    things answer my mind.

DON PEDRO

    Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:
    but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
    dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
    Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior
    Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
    affection the one with the other. I would fain have
    it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
    you three will but minister such assistance as I
    shall give you direction.

LEONATO

    My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten
    nights' watchings.

CLAUDIO

    And I, my lord.

DON PEDRO

    And you too, gentle Hero?

HERO

    I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my
    cousin to a good husband.

DON PEDRO

    And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
    I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble
    strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
    will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
    shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
    two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
    despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
    shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
    Cupid is no longer an archer: hi s glory shall be
    ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,
    and I will tell you my drift.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO

DON JOHN

    It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the
    daughter of Leonato.

BORACHIO

    Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.

DON JOHN

    Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be
    medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,
    and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
    evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?

BORACHIO

    Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no
    dishonesty shall appear in me.

DON JOHN

    Show me briefly how.

BORACHIO

    I think I told your lordship a year since, how much
    I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting
    gentlewoman to Hero.

DON JOHN

    I remember.

BORACHIO

    I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,
    appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.

DON JOHN

    What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?

BORACHIO

    The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to
    the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that
    he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
    Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold
    up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.

DON JOHN

    What proof shall I make of that?

BORACHIO

    Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,
    to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any
    other issue?

DON JOHN

    Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.

BORACHIO

    Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
    the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
    that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
    prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
    honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
    reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
    semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
    thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
    offer them instances; which shall bear no less
    likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
    hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
    Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
    before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I
    will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
    absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth
    of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
    assurance and all the preparation overthrown.

DON JOHN

    Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put
    it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and
    thy fee is a thousand ducats.

BORACHIO

    Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning
    shall not shame me.

DON JOHN

    I will presently go learn their day of marriage.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. LEONATO'S orchard.

    Enter BENEDICK

BENEDICK

    Boy!

    Enter Boy

Boy

    Signior?

BENEDICK

    In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither
    to me in the orchard.

Boy

    I am here already, sir.

BENEDICK

    I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.

    Exit Boy
    I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much
    another man is a fool when he dedicates his
    behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
    such shallow follies in others, become the argument
    of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
    is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
    with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
    rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
    when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
    good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
    carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
    speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
    and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
    words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
    strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
    these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
    be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
    I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
    of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
    is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
    well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
    graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
    my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,
    or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;
    fair, or I'll never look on her; mild, or come not
    near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
    discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
    be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and
    Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.

    Withdraws

    Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO

DON PEDRO

    Come, shall we hear this music?

CLAUDIO

    Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
    As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!

DON PEDRO

    See you where Benedick hath hid himself?

CLAUDIO

    O, very well, my lord: the music ended,
    We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.

    Enter BALTHASAR with Music

DON PEDRO

    Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.

BALTHASAR

    O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
    To slander music any more than once.

DON PEDRO

    It is the witness still of excellency
    To put a strange face on his own perfection.
    I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.

BALTHASAR

    Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;
    Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
    To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
    Yet will he swear he loves.

DON PEDRO

    Now, pray thee, come;
    Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
    Do it in notes.

BALTHASAR

    Note this before my notes;
    There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.

DON PEDRO

    Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
    Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.

    Air

BENEDICK

    Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it
    not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out
    of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when
    all's done.

    The Song

BALTHASAR

    Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
    Men were deceivers ever,
    One foot in sea and one on shore,
    To one thing constant never:
    Then sigh not so, but let them go,
    And be you blithe and bonny,
    Converting all your sounds of woe
    Into Hey nonny, nonny.
    Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
    Of dumps so dull and heavy;
    The fraud of men was ever so,
    Since summer first was leafy:
    Then sigh not so, & c.

DON PEDRO

    By my troth, a good song.

BALTHASAR

    And an ill singer, my lord.

DON PEDRO

    Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.

BENEDICK

    An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,
    they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad
    voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the
    night-raven, come what plague could have come after
    it.

DON PEDRO

    Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,
    get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we
    would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.

BALTHASAR

    The best I can, my lord.

DON PEDRO

    Do so: farewell.

    Exit BALTHASAR
    Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of
    to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with
    Signior Benedick?

CLAUDIO

    O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did
    never think that lady would have loved any man.

LEONATO

    No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she
    should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in
    all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.

BENEDICK

    Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?

LEONATO

    By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think
    of it but that she loves him with an enraged
    affection: it is past the infinite of thought.

DON PEDRO

    May be she doth but counterfeit.

CLAUDIO

    Faith, like enough.

LEONATO

    O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of
    passion came so near the life of passion as she
    discovers it.

DON PEDRO

    Why, what effects of passion shows she?

CLAUDIO

    Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.

LEONATO

    What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard
    my daughter tell you how.

CLAUDIO

    She did, indeed.

DON PEDRO

    How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I
    thought her spirit had been invincible against all
    assaults of affection.

LEONATO

    I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially
    against Benedick.

BENEDICK

    I should think this a gull, but that the
    white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
    sure, hide himself in such reverence.

CLAUDIO

    He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.

DON PEDRO

    Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?

LEONATO

    No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.

CLAUDIO

    'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall
    I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
    with scorn, write to him that I love him?'

LEONATO

    This says she now when she is beginning to write to
    him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and
    there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
    sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.

CLAUDIO

    Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a
    pretty jest your daughter told us of.

LEONATO

    O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she
    found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?

CLAUDIO

    That.

LEONATO

    O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;
    railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
    to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I
    measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I
    should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
    love him, I should.'

CLAUDIO

    Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
    beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O
    sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'

LEONATO

    She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
    ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
    is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
    to herself: it is very true.

DON PEDRO

    It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
    other, if she will not discover it.

CLAUDIO

    To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
    torment the poor lady worse.

DON PEDRO

    An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an
    excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,
    she is virtuous.

CLAUDIO

    And she is exceeding wise.

DON PEDRO

    In every thing but in loving Benedick.

LEONATO

    O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender
    a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
    the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just
    cause, being her uncle and her guardian.

DON PEDRO

    I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
    have daffed all other respects and made her half
    myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
    what a' will say.

LEONATO

    Were it good, think you?

CLAUDIO

    Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she
    will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
    she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
    her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
    accustomed crossness.

DON PEDRO

    She doth well: if she should make tender of her
    love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the
    man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.

CLAUDIO

    He is a very proper man.

DON PEDRO

    He hath indeed a good outward happiness.

CLAUDIO

    Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.

DON PEDRO

    He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.

CLAUDIO

    And I take him to be valiant.

DON PEDRO

    As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
    quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
    avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
    them with a most Christian-like fear.

LEONATO

    If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:
    if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a
    quarrel with fear and trembling.

DON PEDRO

    And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,
    howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
    he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
    we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?

CLAUDIO

    Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with
    good counsel.

LEONATO

    Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.

DON PEDRO

    Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:
    let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
    could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
    how much he is unworthy so good a lady.

LEONATO

    My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.

CLAUDIO

    If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
    trust my expectation.

DON PEDRO

    Let there be the same net spread for her; and that
    must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
    sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
    another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
    scene that I would see, which will be merely a
    dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.

    Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO

BENEDICK

    [Coming forward] This can be no trick: the
    conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
    this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
    seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
    why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
    they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
    the love come from her; they say too that she will
    rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
    never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
    are they that hear their detractions and can put
    them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
    truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
    so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
    me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
    no great argument of her folly, for I will be
    horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
    odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
    because I have railed so long against marriage: but
    doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
    in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
    Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
    the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
    No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
    die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
    were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
    she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
    her.

    Enter BEATRICE

BEATRICE

    Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.

BENEDICK

    Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.

BEATRICE

    I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
    pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
    not have come.

BENEDICK

    You take pleasure then in the message?

BEATRICE

    Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's
    point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,
    signior: fare you well.

    Exit

BENEDICK

    Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
    to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took
    no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
    to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
    that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
    not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not
    love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.

    Exit

ACT III
SCENE I. LEONATO'S garden.

    Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA

HERO

    Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;
    There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
    Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
    Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
    Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
    Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
    And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
    Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,
    Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,
    Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
    Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
    To listen our purpose. This is thy office;
    Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.

MARGARET

    I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.

    Exit

HERO

    Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
    As we do trace this alley up and down,
    Our talk must only be of Benedick.
    When I do name him, let it be thy part
    To praise him more than ever man did merit:
    My talk to thee must be how Benedick
    Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
    Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
    That only wounds by hearsay.

    Enter BEATRICE, behind
    Now begin;
    For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
    Close by the ground, to hear our conference.

URSULA

    The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
    Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
    And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
    So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
    Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
    Fear you not my part of the dialogue.

HERO

    Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
    Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.

    Approaching the bower
    No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
    I know her spirits are as coy and wild
    As haggerds of the rock.

URSULA

    But are you sure
    That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?

HERO

    So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.

URSULA

    And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?

HERO

    They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
    But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
    To wish him wrestle with affection,
    And never to let Beatrice know of it.

URSULA

    Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
    Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
    As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?

HERO

    O god of love! I know he doth deserve
    As much as may be yielded to a man:
    But Nature never framed a woman's heart
    Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
    Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
    Misprising what they look on, and her wit
    Values itself so highly that to her
    All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
    Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
    She is so self-endeared.

URSULA

    Sure, I think so;
    And therefore certainly it were not good
    She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.

HERO

    Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
    How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
    But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
    She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
    If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
    Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
    If low, an agate very vilely cut;
    If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
    If silent, why, a block moved with none.
    So turns she every man the wrong side out
    And never gives to truth and virtue that
    Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.

URSULA

    Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.

HERO

    No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
    As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
    But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
    She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
    Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
    Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
    Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
    It were a better death than die with mocks,
    Which is as bad as die with tickling.

URSULA

    Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.

HERO

    No; rather I will go to Benedick
    And counsel him to fight against his passion.
    And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
    To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
    How much an ill word may empoison liking.

URSULA

    O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
    She cannot be so much without true judgment--
    Having so swift and excellent a wit
    As she is prized to have--as to refuse
    So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.

HERO

    He is the only man of Italy.
    Always excepted my dear Claudio.

URSULA

    I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
    Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
    For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
    Goes foremost in report through Italy.

HERO

    Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.

URSULA

    His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
    When are you married, madam?

HERO

    Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:
    I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
    Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.

URSULA

    She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.

HERO

    If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
    Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.

    Exeunt HERO and URSULA

BEATRICE

    [Coming forward]
    What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
    Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
    Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
    No glory lives behind the back of such.
    And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
    Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
    If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
    To bind our loves up in a holy band;
    For others say thou dost deserve, and I
    Believe it better than reportingly.

    Exit

SCENE II. A room in LEONATO'S house

    Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO

DON PEDRO

    I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and
    then go I toward Arragon.

CLAUDIO

    I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll
    vouchsafe me.

DON PEDRO

    Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
    of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
    and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
    with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown
    of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all
    mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's
    bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
    him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
    tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his
    tongue speaks.

BENEDICK

    Gallants, I am not as I have been.

LEONATO

    So say I methinks you are sadder.

CLAUDIO

    I hope he be in love.

DON PEDRO

    Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in
    him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
    he wants money.

BENEDICK

    I have the toothache.

DON PEDRO

    Draw it.

BENEDICK

    Hang it!

CLAUDIO

    You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.

DON PEDRO

    What! sigh for the toothache?

LEONATO

    Where is but a humour or a worm.

BENEDICK

    Well, every one can master a grief but he that has
    it.

CLAUDIO

    Yet say I, he is in love.

DON PEDRO

    There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be
    a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be
    a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
    shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
    the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
    the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
    to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
    fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.

CLAUDIO

    If he be not in love with some woman, there is no
    believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
    mornings; what should that bode?

DON PEDRO

    Hath any man seen him at the barber's?

CLAUDIO

    No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,
    and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
    stuffed tennis-balls.

LEONATO

    Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.

DON PEDRO

    Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him
    out by that?

CLAUDIO

    That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.

DON PEDRO

    The greatest note of it is his melancholy.

CLAUDIO

    And when was he wont to wash his face?

DON PEDRO

    Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear
    what they say of him.

CLAUDIO

    Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into
    a lute-string and now governed by stops.

DON PEDRO

    Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,
    conclude he is in love.

CLAUDIO

    Nay, but I know who loves him.

DON PEDRO

    That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.

CLAUDIO

    Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of
    all, dies for him.

DON PEDRO

    She shall be buried with her face upwards.

BENEDICK

    Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
    signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
    or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
    hobby-horses must not hear.

    Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO

DON PEDRO

    For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.

CLAUDIO

    'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this
    played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two
    bears will not bite one another when they meet.

    Enter DON JOHN

DON JOHN

    My lord and brother, God save you!

DON PEDRO

    Good den, brother.

DON JOHN

    If your leisure served, I would speak with you.

DON PEDRO

    In private?

DON JOHN

    If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for
    what I would speak of concerns him.

DON PEDRO

    What's the matter?

DON JOHN

    [To CLAUDIO] Means your lordship to be married
    to-morrow?

DON PEDRO

    You know he does.

DON JOHN

    I know not that, when he knows what I know.

CLAUDIO

    If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.

DON JOHN

    You may think I love you not: let that appear
    hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will
    manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you
    well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
    your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and
    labour ill bestowed.

DON PEDRO

    Why, what's the matter?

DON JOHN

    I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances
    shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,
    the lady is disloyal.

CLAUDIO

    Who, Hero?

DON PEDRO

    Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:

CLAUDIO

    Disloyal?

DON JOHN

    The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I
    could say she were worse: think you of a worse
    title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till
    further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall
    see her chamber-window entered, even the night
    before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
    to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour
    to change your mind.

CLAUDIO

    May this be so?

DON PEDRO

    I will not think it.

DON JOHN

    If you dare not trust that you see, confess not
    that you know: if you will follow me, I will show
    you enough; and when you have seen more and heard
    more, proceed accordingly.

CLAUDIO

    If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry
    her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should
    wed, there will I shame her.

DON PEDRO

    And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join
    with thee to disgrace her.

DON JOHN

    I will disparage her no farther till you are my
    witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and
    let the issue show itself.

DON PEDRO

    O day untowardly turned!

CLAUDIO

    O mischief strangely thwarting!

DON JOHN

    O plague right well prevented! so will you say when
    you have seen the sequel.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A street.

    Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch

DOGBERRY

    Are you good men and true?

VERGES

    Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer
    salvation, body and soul.

DOGBERRY

    Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if
    they should have any allegiance in them, being
    chosen for the prince's watch.

VERGES

    Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.

DOGBERRY

    First, who think you the most desertless man to be
    constable?

First Watchman

    Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can
    write and read.

DOGBERRY

    Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
    you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
    the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.

Second Watchman

    Both which, master constable,--

DOGBERRY

    You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,
    for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
    no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,
    let that appear when there is no need of such
    vanity. You are thought here to be the most
    senseless and fit man for the constable of the
    watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
    charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
    to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.

Second Watchman

    How if a' will not stand?

DOGBERRY

    Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and
    presently call the rest of the watch together and
    thank God you are rid of a knave.

VERGES

    If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none
    of the prince's subjects.

DOGBERRY

    True, and they are to meddle with none but the
    prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
    the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to
    talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.

Watchman

    We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
    belongs to a watch.

DOGBERRY

    Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
    watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
    offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
    stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
    ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.

Watchman

    How if they will not?

DOGBERRY

    Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
    they make you not then the better answer, you may
    say they are not the men you took them for.

Watchman

    Well, sir.

DOGBERRY

    If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
    of your office, to be no true man; and, for such
    kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
    why the more is for your honesty.

Watchman

    If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay
    hands on him?

DOGBERRY

    Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they
    that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
    way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
    show himself what he is and steal out of your company.

VERGES

    You have been always called a merciful man, partner.

DOGBERRY

    Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more
    a man who hath any honesty in him.

VERGES

    If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call
    to the nurse and bid her still it.

Watchman

    How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?

DOGBERRY

    Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake
    her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
    lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.

VERGES

    'Tis very true.

DOGBERRY

    This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are
    to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
    prince in the night, you may stay him.

VERGES

    Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.

DOGBERRY

    Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows
    the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
    the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought
    to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
    man against his will.

VERGES

    By'r lady, I think it be so.

DOGBERRY

    Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be
    any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your
    fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
    Come, neighbour.

Watchman

    Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here
    upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.

DOGBERRY

    One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch
    about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being
    there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
    Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.

    Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES

    Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE

BORACHIO

    What Conrade!

Watchman

    [Aside] Peace! stir not.

BORACHIO

    Conrade, I say!

CONRADE

    Here, man; I am at thy elbow.

BORACHIO

    Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a
    scab follow.

CONRADE

    I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward
    with thy tale.

BORACHIO

    Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for
    it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,
    utter all to thee.

Watchman

    [Aside] Some treason, masters: yet stand close.

BORACHIO

    Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.

CONRADE

    Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?

BORACHIO

    Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
    villany should be so rich; for when rich villains
    have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
    price they will.

CONRADE

    I wonder at it.

BORACHIO

    That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that
    the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is
    nothing to a man.

CONRADE

    Yes, it is apparel.

BORACHIO

    I mean, the fashion.

CONRADE

    Yes, the fashion is the fashion.

BORACHIO

    Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But
    seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
    is?

Watchman

    [Aside] I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile
    thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a
    gentleman: I remember his name.

BORACHIO

    Didst thou not hear somebody?

CONRADE

    No; 'twas the vane on the house.

BORACHIO

    Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this
    fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot
    bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
    sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
    in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
    priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
    shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
    where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?

CONRADE

    All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
    out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
    thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
    shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?

BORACHIO

    Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
    wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
    name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
    chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
    night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
    tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
    planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
    John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.

CONRADE

    And thought they Margaret was Hero?

BORACHIO

    Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the
    devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
    by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
    the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
    by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
    Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore
    he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
    at the temple, and there, before the whole
    congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
    and send her home again without a husband.

First Watchman

    We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!

Second Watchman

    Call up the right master constable. We have here
    recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
    ever was known in the commonwealth.

First Watchman

    And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'
    wears a lock.

CONRADE

    Masters, masters,--

Second Watchman

    You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.

CONRADE

    Masters,--

First Watchman

    Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.

BORACHIO

    We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken
    up of these men's bills.

CONRADE

    A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. HERO's apartment.

    Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA

HERO

    Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire
    her to rise.

URSULA

    I will, lady.

HERO

    And bid her come hither.

URSULA

    Well.

    Exit

MARGARET

    Troth, I think your other rabato were better.

HERO

    No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.

MARGARET

    By my troth, 's not so good; and I warrant your
    cousin will say so.

HERO

    My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear
    none but this.

MARGARET

    I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair
    were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare
    fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's
    gown that they praise so.

HERO

    O, that exceeds, they say.

MARGARET

    By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of
    yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with
    silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,
    and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:
    but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent
    fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.

HERO

    God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is
    exceeding heavy.

MARGARET

    'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.

HERO

    Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?

MARGARET

    Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not
    marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord
    honourable without marriage? I think you would have
    me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad
    thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend
    nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a
    husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband
    and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not
    heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.

    Enter BEATRICE

HERO

    Good morrow, coz.

BEATRICE

    Good morrow, sweet Hero.

HERO

    Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?

BEATRICE

    I am out of all other tune, methinks.

MARGARET

    Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a
    burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.

BEATRICE

    Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
    husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall
    lack no barns.

MARGARET

    O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.

BEATRICE

    'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were
    ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!

MARGARET

    For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?

BEATRICE

    For the letter that begins them all, H.

MARGARET

    Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more
    sailing by the star.

BEATRICE

    What means the fool, trow?

MARGARET

    Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!

HERO

    These gloves the count sent me; they are an
    excellent perfume.

BEATRICE

    I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.

MARGARET

    A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.

BEATRICE

    O, God help me! God help me! how long have you
    professed apprehension?

MARGARET

    Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?

BEATRICE

    It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your
    cap. By my troth, I am sick.

MARGARET

    Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,
    and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.

HERO

    There thou prickest her with a thistle.

BEATRICE

    Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in
    this Benedictus.

MARGARET

    Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I
    meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance
    that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am
    not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list
    not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,
    if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you
    are in love or that you will be in love or that you
    can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and
    now is he become a man: he swore he would never
    marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats
    his meat without grudging: and how you may be
    converted I know not, but methinks you look with
    your eyes as other women do.

BEATRICE

    What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?

MARGARET

    Not a false gallop.

    Re-enter URSULA

URSULA

    Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior
    Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the
    town, are come to fetch you to church.

HERO

    Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Another room in LEONATO'S house.

    Enter LEONATO, with DOGBERRY and VERGES

LEONATO

    What would you with me, honest neighbour?

DOGBERRY

    Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you
    that decerns you nearly.

LEONATO

    Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.

DOGBERRY

    Marry, this it is, sir.

VERGES

    Yes, in truth it is, sir.

LEONATO

    What is it, my good friends?

DOGBERRY

    Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the
    matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so
    blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,
    in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.

VERGES

    Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living
    that is an old man and no honester than I.

DOGBERRY

    Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.

LEONATO

    Neighbours, you are tedious.

DOGBERRY

    It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the
    poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,
    if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in
    my heart to bestow it all of your worship.

LEONATO

    All thy tediousness on me, ah?

DOGBERRY

    Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for
    I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any
    man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I
    am glad to hear it.

VERGES

    And so am I.

LEONATO

    I would fain know what you have to say.

VERGES

    Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your
    worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant
    knaves as any in Messina.

DOGBERRY

    A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they
    say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help
    us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,
    neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men
    ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest
    soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever
    broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men
    are not alike; alas, good neighbour!

LEONATO

    Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.

DOGBERRY

    Gifts that God gives.

LEONATO

    I must leave you.

DOGBERRY

    One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
    comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would
    have them this morning examined before your worship.

LEONATO

    Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I
    am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.

DOGBERRY

    It shall be suffigance.

LEONATO

    Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to
    her husband.

LEONATO

    I'll wait upon them: I am ready.

    Exeunt LEONATO and Messenger

DOGBERRY

    Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;
    bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we
    are now to examination these men.

VERGES

    And we must do it wisely.

DOGBERRY

    We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here's
    that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only
    get the learned writer to set down our
    excommunication and meet me at the gaol.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. A church.

    Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, HERO, BEATRICE, and Attendants

LEONATO

    Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain
    form of marriage, and you shall recount their
    particular duties afterwards.

FRIAR FRANCIS

    You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.

CLAUDIO

    No.

LEONATO

    To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.

FRIAR FRANCIS

    Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.

HERO

    I do.

FRIAR FRANCIS

    If either of you know any inward impediment why you
    should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,
    to utter it.

CLAUDIO

    Know you any, Hero?

HERO

    None, my lord.

FRIAR FRANCIS

    Know you any, count?

LEONATO

    I dare make his answer, none.

CLAUDIO

    O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily
    do, not knowing what they do!

BENEDICK

    How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of
    laughing, as, ah, ha, he!

CLAUDIO

    Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
    Will you with free and unconstrained soul
    Give me this maid, your daughter?

LEONATO

    As freely, son, as God did give her me.

CLAUDIO

    And what have I to give you back, whose worth
    May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?

DON PEDRO

    Nothing, unless you render her again.

CLAUDIO

    Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
    There, Leonato, take her back again:
    Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
    She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
    Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
    O, what authority and show of truth
    Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
    Comes not that blood as modest evidence
    To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
    All you that see her, that she were a maid,
    By these exterior shows? But she is none:
    She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
    Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.

LEONATO

    What do you mean, my lord?

CLAUDIO

    Not to be married,
    Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.

LEONATO

    Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
    Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
    And made defeat of her virginity,--

CLAUDIO

    I know what you would say: if I have known her,
    You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
    And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
    No, Leonato,
    I never tempted her with word too large;
    But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
    Bashful sincerity and comely love.

HERO

    And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?

CLAUDIO

    Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
    You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
    As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
    But you are more intemperate in your blood
    Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
    That rage in savage sensuality.

HERO

    Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?

LEONATO

    Sweet prince, why speak not you?

DON PEDRO

    What should I speak?
    I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
    To link my dear friend to a common stale.

LEONATO

    Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?

DON JOHN

    Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.

BENEDICK

    This looks not like a nuptial.

HERO

    True! O God!

CLAUDIO

    Leonato, stand I here?
    Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
    Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?

LEONATO

    All this is so: but what of this, my lord?

CLAUDIO

    Let me but move one question to your daughter;
    And, by that fatherly and kindly power
    That you have in her, bid her answer truly.

LEONATO

    I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.

HERO

    O, God defend me! how am I beset!
    What kind of catechising call you this?

CLAUDIO

    To make you answer truly to your name.

HERO

    Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
    With any just reproach?

CLAUDIO

    Marry, that can Hero;
    Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
    What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
    Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
    Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.

HERO

    I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.

DON PEDRO

    Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
    I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
    Myself, my brother and this grieved count
    Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
    Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
    Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
    Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
    A thousand times in secret.

DON JOHN

    Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
    Not to be spoke of;
    There is not chastity enough in language
    Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
    I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.

CLAUDIO

    O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
    If half thy outward graces had been placed
    About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
    But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
    Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
    For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
    And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
    To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
    And never shall it more be gracious.

LEONATO

    Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?

    HERO swoons

BEATRICE

    Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?

DON JOHN

    Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,
    Smother her spirits up.

    Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO

BENEDICK

    How doth the lady?

BEATRICE

    Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
    Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!

LEONATO

    O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
    Death is the fairest cover for her shame
    That may be wish'd for.

BEATRICE

    How now, cousin Hero!

FRIAR FRANCIS

    Have comfort, lady.

LEONATO

    Dost thou look up?

FRIAR FRANCIS

    Yea, wherefore should she not?

LEONATO

    Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
    Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
    The story that is printed in her blood?
    Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:
    For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
    Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
    Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
    Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
    Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
    O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
    Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
    Why had I not with charitable hand
    Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
    Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
    I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
    This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
    But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
    And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
    That I myself was to myself not mine,
    Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen
    Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
    Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
    And salt too little which may season give
    To her foul-tainted flesh!

BENEDICK

    Sir, sir, be patient.
    For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
    I know not what to say.

BEATRICE

    O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!

BENEDICK

    Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?

BEATRICE

    No, truly not; although, until last night,
    I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.

LEONATO

    Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
    Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
    Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,
    Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
    Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.

FRIAR FRANCIS

    Hear me a little;
    For I have only been silent so long
    And given way unto this course of fortune.
    ...
    By noting of the lady I have mark'd
    A thousand blushing apparitions
    To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
    In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
    And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
    To burn the errors that these princes hold
    Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
    Trust not my reading nor my observations,
    Which with experimental seal doth warrant
    The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
    My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
    If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
    Under some biting error.

LEONATO

    Friar, it cannot be.
    Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
    Is that she will not add to her damnation
    A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
    Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
    That which appears in proper nakedness?

FRIAR FRANCIS

    Lady, what man is he you are accused of?

HERO

    They know that do accuse me; I know none:
    If I know more of any man alive
    Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
    Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
    Prove you that any man with me conversed
    At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
    Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
    Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!

FRIAR FRANCIS

    There is some strange misprision in the princes.

BENEDICK

    Two of them have the very bent of honour;
    And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
    The practise of it lives in John the bastard,
    Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.

LEONATO

    I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
    These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
    The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
    Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
    Nor age so eat up my invention,
    Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
    Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
    But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
    Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
    Ability in means and choice of friends,
    To quit me of them throughly.

FRIAR FRANCIS

    Pause awhile,
    And let my counsel sway you in this case.
    Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
    Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
    And publish it that she is dead indeed;
    Maintain a mourning ostentation
    And on your family's old monument
    Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
    That appertain unto a burial.

LEONATO

    What shall become of this? what will this do?

FRIAR FRANCIS

    Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
    Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
    But not for that dream I on this strange course,
    But on this travail look for greater birth.
    She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
    Upon the instant that she was accused,
    Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
    Of every hearer: for it so falls out
    That what we have we prize not to the worth
    Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
    Why, then we rack the value, then we find
    The virtue that possession would not show us
    Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
    When he shall hear she died upon his words,
    The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
    Into his study of imagination,
    And every lovely organ of her life
    Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
    More moving-delicate and full of life,
    Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
    Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
    If ever love had interest in his liver,
    And wish he had not so accused her,
    No, though he thought his accusation true.
    Let this be so, and doubt not but success
    Will fashion the event in better shape
    Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
    But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
    The supposition of the lady's death
    Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
    And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
    As best befits her wounded reputation,
    In some reclusive and religious life,
    Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.

BENEDICK

    Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
    And though you know my inwardness and love
    Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
    Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
    As secretly and justly as your soul
    Should with your body.

LEONATO

    Being that I flow in grief,
    The smallest twine may lead me.

FRIAR FRANCIS

    'Tis well consented: presently away;
    For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
    Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
    Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.

    Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE

BENEDICK

    Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?

BEATRICE

    Yea, and I will weep a while longer.

BENEDICK

    I will not desire that.

BEATRICE

    You have no reason; I do it freely.

BENEDICK

    Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.

BEATRICE

    Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!

BENEDICK

    Is there any way to show such friendship?

BEATRICE

    A very even way, but no such friend.

BENEDICK

    May a man do it?

BEATRICE

    It is a man's office, but not yours.

BENEDICK

    I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
    not that strange?

BEATRICE

    As strange as the thing I know not. It were as
    possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
    you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
    confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.

BENEDICK

    By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.

BEATRICE

    Do not swear, and eat it.

BENEDICK

    I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make
    him eat it that says I love not you.

BEATRICE

    Will you not eat your word?

BENEDICK

    With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest
    I love thee.

BEATRICE

    Why, then, God forgive me!

BENEDICK

    What offence, sweet Beatrice?

BEATRICE

    You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to
    protest I loved you.

BENEDICK

    And do it with all thy heart.

BEATRICE

    I love you with so much of my heart that none is
    left to protest.

BENEDICK

    Come, bid me do any thing for thee.

BEATRICE

    Kill Claudio.

BENEDICK

    Ha! not for the wide world.

BEATRICE

    You kill me to deny it. Farewell.

BENEDICK

    Tarry, sweet Beatrice.

BEATRICE

    I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in
    you: nay, I pray you, let me go.

BENEDICK

    Beatrice,--

BEATRICE

    In faith, I will go.

BENEDICK

    We'll be friends first.

BEATRICE

    You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.

BENEDICK

    Is Claudio thine enemy?

BEATRICE

    Is he not approved in the height a villain, that
    hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
    that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
    come to take hands; and then, with public
    accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
    --O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
    in the market-place.

BENEDICK

    Hear me, Beatrice,--

BEATRICE

    Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!

BENEDICK

    Nay, but, Beatrice,--

BEATRICE

    Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.

BENEDICK

    Beat--

BEATRICE

    Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,
    a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,
    surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
    had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
    manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
    compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
    trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
    that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
    man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.

BENEDICK

    Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.

BEATRICE

    Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.

BENEDICK

    Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?

BEATRICE

    Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.

BENEDICK

    Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will
    kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,
    Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
    hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
    cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A prison.

    Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and Sexton, in gowns; and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO

DOGBERRY

    Is our whole dissembly appeared?

VERGES

    O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.

Sexton

    Which be the malefactors?

DOGBERRY

    Marry, that am I and my partner.

VERGES

    Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.

Sexton

    But which are the offenders that are to be
    examined? let them come before master constable.

DOGBERRY

    Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your
    name, friend?

BORACHIO

    Borachio.

DOGBERRY

    Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?

CONRADE

    I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.

DOGBERRY

    Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do
    you serve God?

CONRADE BORACHIO

    Yea, sir, we hope.

DOGBERRY

    Write down, that they hope they serve God: and
    write God first; for God defend but God should go
    before such villains! Masters, it is proved already
    that you are little better than false knaves; and it
    will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer
    you for yourselves?

CONRADE

    Marry, sir, we say we are none.

DOGBERRY

    A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I
    will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a
    word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought
    you are false knaves.

BORACHIO

    Sir, I say to you we are none.

DOGBERRY

    Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a
    tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?

Sexton

    Master constable, you go not the way to examine:
    you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.

DOGBERRY

    Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch
    come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's
    name, accuse these men.

First Watchman

    This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's
    brother, was a villain.

DOGBERRY

    Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat
    perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.

BORACHIO

    Master constable,--

DOGBERRY

    Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,
    I promise thee.

Sexton

    What heard you him say else?

Second Watchman

    Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of
    Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.

DOGBERRY

    Flat burglary as ever was committed.

VERGES

    Yea, by mass, that it is.

Sexton

    What else, fellow?

First Watchman

    And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to
    disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.

DOGBERRY

    O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
    redemption for this.

Sexton

    What else?

Watchman

    This is all.

Sexton

    And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
    Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;
    Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner
    refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.
    Master constable, let these men be bound, and
    brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show
    him their examination.

    Exit

DOGBERRY

    Come, let them be opinioned.

VERGES

    Let them be in the hands--

CONRADE

    Off, coxcomb!

DOGBERRY

    God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write
    down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.
    Thou naughty varlet!

CONRADE

    Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.

DOGBERRY

    Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
    suspect my years? O that he were here to write me
    down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an
    ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not
    that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of
    piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
    I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,
    and, which is more, a householder, and, which is
    more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
    Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a
    rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath
    had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every
    thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that
    I had been writ down an ass!

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Before LEONATO'S house.

    Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO

ANTONIO

    If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:
    And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
    Against yourself.

LEONATO

    I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
    Which falls into mine ears as profitless
    As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
    Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
    But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
    Bring me a father that so loved his child,
    Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
    And bid him speak of patience;
    Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
    And let it answer every strain for strain,
    As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
    In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
    If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
    Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,
    Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
    With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
    And I of him will gather patience.
    But there is no such man: for, brother, men
    Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
    Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
    Their counsel turns to passion, which before
    Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
    Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
    Charm ache with air and agony with words:
    No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
    To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
    But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
    To be so moral when he shall endure
    The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
    My griefs cry louder than advertisement.

ANTONIO

    Therein do men from children nothing differ.

LEONATO

    I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;
    For there was never yet philosopher
    That could endure the toothache patiently,
    However they have writ the style of gods
    And made a push at chance and sufferance.

ANTONIO

    Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
    Make those that do offend you suffer too.

LEONATO

    There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.
    My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;
    And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince
    And all of them that thus dishonour her.

ANTONIO

    Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.

    Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO

DON PEDRO

    Good den, good den.

CLAUDIO

    Good day to both of you.

LEONATO

    Hear you. my lords,--

DON PEDRO

    We have some haste, Leonato.

LEONATO

    Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:
    Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.

DON PEDRO

    Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.

ANTONIO

    If he could right himself with quarreling,
    Some of us would lie low.

CLAUDIO

    Who wrongs him?

LEONATO

    Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--
    Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
    I fear thee not.

CLAUDIO

    Marry, beshrew my hand,
    If it should give your age such cause of fear:
    In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.

LEONATO

    Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:
    I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
    As under privilege of age to brag
    What I have done being young, or what would do
    Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
    Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
    That I am forced to lay my reverence by
    And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
    Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
    I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;
    Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
    And she lies buried with her ancestors;
    O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
    Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!

CLAUDIO

    My villany?

LEONATO

    Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.

DON PEDRO

    You say not right, old man.

LEONATO

    My lord, my lord,
    I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
    Despite his nice fence and his active practise,
    His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.

CLAUDIO

    Away! I will not have to do with you.

LEONATO

    Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:
    If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.

ANTONIO

    He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
    But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
    Win me and wear me; let him answer me.
    Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:
    Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
    Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.

LEONATO

    Brother,--

ANTONIO

    Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
    And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
    That dare as well answer a man indeed
    As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:
    Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!

LEONATO

    Brother Antony,--

ANTONIO

    Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
    And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--
    Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
    That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
    Go anticly, show outward hideousness,
    And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
    How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;
    And this is all.

LEONATO

    But, brother Antony,--

ANTONIO

    Come, 'tis no matter:
    Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.

DON PEDRO

    Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
    My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:
    But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing
    But what was true and very full of proof.

LEONATO

    My lord, my lord,--

DON PEDRO

    I will not hear you.

LEONATO

    No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.

ANTONIO

    And shall, or some of us will smart for it.

    Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO

DON PEDRO

    See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.

    Enter BENEDICK

CLAUDIO

    Now, signior, what news?

BENEDICK

    Good day, my lord.

DON PEDRO

    Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part
    almost a fray.

CLAUDIO

    We had like to have had our two noses snapped off
    with two old men without teeth.

DON PEDRO

    Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had
    we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.

BENEDICK

    In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came
    to seek you both.

CLAUDIO

    We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are
    high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
    away. Wilt thou use thy wit?

BENEDICK

    It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?

DON PEDRO

    Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?

CLAUDIO

    Never any did so, though very many have been beside
    their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the
    minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.

DON PEDRO

    As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou
    sick, or angry?

CLAUDIO

    What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,
    thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.

BENEDICK

    Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you
    charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.

CLAUDIO

    Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was
    broke cross.

DON PEDRO

    By this light, he changes more and more: I think
    he be angry indeed.

CLAUDIO

    If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.

BENEDICK

    Shall I speak a word in your ear?

CLAUDIO

    God bless me from a challenge!

BENEDICK

    [Aside to CLAUDIO] You are a villain; I jest not:
    I will make it good how you dare, with what you
    dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will
    protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet
    lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me
    hear from you.

CLAUDIO

    Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.

DON PEDRO

    What, a feast, a feast?

CLAUDIO

    I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's
    head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most
    curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find
    a woodcock too?

BENEDICK

    Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.

DON PEDRO

    I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
    other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'
    said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a
    great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'
    'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it
    hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman
    is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'
    'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I
    believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on
    Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;
    there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
    did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
    virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
    wast the properest man in Italy.

CLAUDIO

    For the which she wept heartily and said she cared
    not.

DON PEDRO

    Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she
    did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:
    the old man's daughter told us all.

CLAUDIO

    All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was
    hid in the garden.

DON PEDRO

    But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
    the sensible Benedick's head?

CLAUDIO

    Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the
    married man'?

BENEDICK

    Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave
    you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests
    as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,
    hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
    you: I must discontinue your company: your brother
    the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among
    you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord
    Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till
    then, peace be with him.

    Exit

DON PEDRO

    He is in earnest.

CLAUDIO

    In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for
    the love of Beatrice.

DON PEDRO

    And hath challenged thee.

CLAUDIO

    Most sincerely.

DON PEDRO

    What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his
    doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!

CLAUDIO

    He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a
    doctor to such a man.

DON PEDRO

    But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and
    be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?

    Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO

DOGBERRY

    Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she
    shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,
    an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.

DON PEDRO

    How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio
    one!

CLAUDIO

    Hearken after their offence, my lord.

DON PEDRO

    Officers, what offence have these men done?

DOGBERRY

    Marry, sir, they have committed false report;
    moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,
    they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have
    belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust
    things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.

DON PEDRO

    First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I
    ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why
    they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay
    to their charge.

CLAUDIO

    Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by
    my troth, there's one meaning well suited.

DON PEDRO

    Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus
    bound to your answer? this learned constable is
    too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?

BORACHIO

    Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:
    do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have
    deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
    could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
    to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
    to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
    to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
    the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's
    garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
    marry her: my villany they have upon record; which
    I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
    to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my
    master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire
    nothing but the reward of a villain.

DON PEDRO

    Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?

CLAUDIO

    I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.

DON PEDRO

    But did my brother set thee on to this?

BORACHIO

    Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.

DON PEDRO

    He is composed and framed of treachery:
    And fled he is upon this villany.

CLAUDIO

    Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear
    In the rare semblance that I loved it first.

DOGBERRY

    Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our
    sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:
    and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time
    and place shall serve, that I am an ass.

VERGES

    Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the
    Sexton too.

    Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, with the Sexton

LEONATO

    Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,
    That, when I note another man like him,
    I may avoid him: which of these is he?

BORACHIO

    If you would know your wronger, look on me.

LEONATO

    Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
    Mine innocent child?

BORACHIO

    Yea, even I alone.

LEONATO

    No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
    Here stand a pair of honourable men;
    A third is fled, that had a hand in it.
    I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:
    Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
    'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.

CLAUDIO

    I know not how to pray your patience;
    Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
    Impose me to what penance your invention
    Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not
    But in mistaking.

DON PEDRO

    By my soul, nor I:
    And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
    I would bend under any heavy weight
    That he'll enjoin me to.

LEONATO

    I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
    That were impossible: but, I pray you both,
    Possess the people in Messina here
    How innocent she died; and if your love
    Can labour ought in sad invention,
    Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
    And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:
    To-morrow morning come you to my house,
    And since you could not be my son-in-law,
    Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
    Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
    And she alone is heir to both of us:
    Give her the right you should have given her cousin,
    And so dies my revenge.

CLAUDIO

    O noble sir,
    Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
    I do embrace your offer; and dispose
    For henceforth of poor Claudio.

LEONATO

    To-morrow then I will expect your coming;
    To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
    Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
    Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,
    Hired to it by your brother.

BORACHIO

    No, by my soul, she was not,
    Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
    But always hath been just and virtuous
    In any thing that I do know by her.

DOGBERRY

    Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and
    black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call
    me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his
    punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
    one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and
    a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's
    name, the which he hath used so long and never paid
    that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing
    for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.

LEONATO

    I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.

DOGBERRY

    Your worship speaks like a most thankful and
    reverend youth; and I praise God for you.

LEONATO

    There's for thy pains.

DOGBERRY

    God save the foundation!

LEONATO

    Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.

DOGBERRY

    I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I
    beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the
    example of others. God keep your worship! I wish
    your worship well; God restore you to health! I
    humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry
    meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.

    Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES

LEONATO

    Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.

ANTONIO

    Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.

DON PEDRO

    We will not fail.

CLAUDIO

    To-night I'll mourn with Hero.

LEONATO

    [To the Watch] Bring you these fellows on. We'll
    talk with Margaret,
    How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.

    Exeunt, severally

SCENE II. LEONATO'S garden.

    Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET, meeting

BENEDICK

    Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at
    my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.

MARGARET

    Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?

BENEDICK

    In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living
    shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou
    deservest it.

MARGARET

    To have no man come over me! why, shall I always
    keep below stairs?

BENEDICK

    Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.

MARGARET

    And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,
    but hurt not.

BENEDICK

    A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a
    woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give
    thee the bucklers.

MARGARET

    Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.

BENEDICK

    If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the
    pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.

MARGARET

    Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.

BENEDICK

    And therefore will come.

    Exit MARGARET

    Sings
    The god of love,
    That sits above,
    And knows me, and knows me,
    How pitiful I deserve,--
    I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good
    swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and
    a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,
    whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
    blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned
    over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I
    cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find
    out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent
    rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,
    'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous
    endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,
    nor I cannot woo in festival terms.

    Enter BEATRICE
    Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?

BEATRICE

    Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.

BENEDICK

    O, stay but till then!

BEATRICE

    'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere
    I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
    knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.

BENEDICK

    Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.

BEATRICE

    Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but
    foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I
    will depart unkissed.

BENEDICK

    Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,
    so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
    plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either
    I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
    him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
    which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?

BEATRICE

    For them all together; which maintained so politic
    a state of evil that they will not admit any good
    part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
    good parts did you first suffer love for me?

BENEDICK

    Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
    indeed, for I love thee against my will.

BEATRICE

    In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!
    If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
    yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.

BENEDICK

    Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.

BEATRICE

    It appears not in this confession: there's not one
    wise man among twenty that will praise himself.

BENEDICK

    An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
    the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
    in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
    no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
    widow weeps.

BEATRICE

    And how long is that, think you?

BENEDICK

    Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in
    rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
    wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
    impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
    own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
    praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
    praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?

BEATRICE

    Very ill.

BENEDICK

    And how do you?

BEATRICE

    Very ill too.

BENEDICK

    Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
    you too, for here comes one in haste.

    Enter URSULA

URSULA

    Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old
    coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been
    falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily
    abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is
    fed and gone. Will you come presently?

BEATRICE

    Will you go hear this news, signior?

BENEDICK

    I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
    buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with
    thee to thy uncle's.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A church.

    Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four with tapers

CLAUDIO

    Is this the monument of Leonato?

Lord

    It is, my lord.

CLAUDIO

    [Reading out of a scroll]
    Done to death by slanderous tongues
    Was the Hero that here lies:
    Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
    Gives her fame which never dies.
    So the life that died with shame
    Lives in death with glorious fame.
    Hang thou there upon the tomb,
    Praising her when I am dumb.
    Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
    SONG.
    Pardon, goddess of the night,
    Those that slew thy virgin knight;
    For the which, with songs of woe,
    Round about her tomb they go.
    Midnight, assist our moan;
    Help us to sigh and groan,
    Heavily, heavily:
    Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
    Till death be uttered,
    Heavily, heavily.

CLAUDIO

    Now, unto thy bones good night!
    Yearly will I do this rite.

DON PEDRO

    Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
    The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
    Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
    Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
    Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.

CLAUDIO

    Good morrow, masters: each his several way.

DON PEDRO

    Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
    And then to Leonato's we will go.

CLAUDIO

    And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
    Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in LEONATO'S house.

    Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, BENEDICK, BEATRICE, MARGARET, URSULA, FRIAR FRANCIS, and HERO

FRIAR FRANCIS

    Did I not tell you she was innocent?

LEONATO

    So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her
    Upon the error that you heard debated:
    But Margaret was in some fault for this,
    Although against her will, as it appears
    In the true course of all the question.

ANTONIO

    Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.

BENEDICK

    And so am I, being else by faith enforced
    To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.

LEONATO

    Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,
    Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
    And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.

    Exeunt Ladies
    The prince and Claudio promised by this hour
    To visit me. You know your office, brother:
    You must be father to your brother's daughter
    And give her to young Claudio.

ANTONIO

    Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.

BENEDICK

    Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.

FRIAR FRANCIS

    To do what, signior?

BENEDICK

    To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
    Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
    Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.

LEONATO

    That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.

BENEDICK

    And I do with an eye of love requite her.

LEONATO

    The sight whereof I think you had from me,
    From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?

BENEDICK

    Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
    But, for my will, my will is your good will
    May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
    In the state of honourable marriage:
    In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.

LEONATO

    My heart is with your liking.

FRIAR FRANCIS

    And my help.
    Here comes the prince and Claudio.

    Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or three others

DON PEDRO

    Good morrow to this fair assembly.

LEONATO

    Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:
    We here attend you. Are you yet determined
    To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?

CLAUDIO

    I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.

LEONATO

    Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.

    Exit ANTONIO

DON PEDRO

    Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
    That you have such a February face,
    So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?

CLAUDIO

    I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
    Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold
    And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
    As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
    When he would play the noble beast in love.

BENEDICK

    Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
    And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
    And got a calf in that same noble feat
    Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.

CLAUDIO

    For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.

    Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked
    Which is the lady I must seize upon?

ANTONIO

    This same is she, and I do give you her.

CLAUDIO

    Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.

LEONATO

    No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
    Before this friar and swear to marry her.

CLAUDIO

    Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
    I am your husband, if you like of me.

HERO

    And when I lived, I was your other wife:

    Unmasking
    And when you loved, you were my other husband.

CLAUDIO

    Another Hero!

HERO

    Nothing certainer:
    One Hero died defiled, but I do live,
    And surely as I live, I am a maid.

DON PEDRO

    The former Hero! Hero that is dead!

LEONATO

    She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.

FRIAR FRANCIS

    All this amazement can I qualify:
    When after that the holy rites are ended,
    I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:
    Meantime let wonder seem familiar,
    And to the chapel let us presently.

BENEDICK

    Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?

BEATRICE

    [Unmasking] I answer to that name. What is your will?

BENEDICK

    Do not you love me?

BEATRICE

    Why, no; no more than reason.

BENEDICK

    Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
    Have been deceived; they swore you did.

BEATRICE

    Do not you love me?

BENEDICK

    Troth, no; no more than reason.

BEATRICE

    Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
    Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.

BENEDICK

    They swore that you were almost sick for me.

BEATRICE

    They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.

BENEDICK

    'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?

BEATRICE

    No, truly, but in friendly recompense.

LEONATO

    Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.

CLAUDIO

    And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
    For here's a paper written in his hand,
    A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
    Fashion'd to Beatrice.

HERO

    And here's another
    Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,
    Containing her affection unto Benedick.

BENEDICK

    A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.
    Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take
    thee for pity.

BEATRICE

    I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield
    upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,
    for I was told you were in a consumption.

BENEDICK

    Peace! I will stop your mouth.

    Kissing her

DON PEDRO

    How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?

BENEDICK

    I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of
    wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
    thou think I care for a satire or an epigram? No:
    if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
    nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
    purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
    purpose that the world can say against it; and
    therefore never flout at me for what I have said
    against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
    conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
    have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
    kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.

CLAUDIO

    I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,
    that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
    life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of
    question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
    exceedingly narrowly to thee.

BENEDICK

    Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
    we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts
    and our wives' heels.

LEONATO

    We'll have dancing afterward.

BENEDICK

    First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,
    thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:
    there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,
    And brought with armed men back to Messina.

BENEDICK

    Think not on him till to-morrow:
    I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.
    Strike up, pipers.

    Dance

Pericles, Prince of Tyre

ACT I
PROLOGUE

    Enter GOWER

    Before the palace of Antioch

    To sing a song that old was sung,
    From ashes ancient Gower is come;
    Assuming man's infirmities,
    To glad your ear, and please your eyes.
    It hath been sung at festivals,
    On ember-eves and holy-ales;
    And lords and ladies in their lives
    Have read it for restoratives:
    The purchase is to make men glorious;
    Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
    If you, born in these latter times,
    When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes.
    And that to hear an old man sing
    May to your wishes pleasure bring
    I life would wish, and that I might
    Waste it for you, like taper-light.
    This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great
    Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:
    The fairest in all Syria,
    I tell you what mine authors say:
    This king unto him took a fere,
    Who died and left a female heir,
    So buxom, blithe, and full of face,
    As heaven had lent her all his grace;
    With whom the father liking took,
    And her to incest did provoke:
    Bad child; worse father! to entice his own
    To evil should be done by none:
    But custom what they did begin
    Was with long use account no sin.
    The beauty of this sinful dame
    Made many princes thither frame,
    To seek her as a bed-fellow,
    In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
    Which to prevent he made a law,
    To keep her still, and men in awe,
    That whoso ask'd her for his wife,
    His riddle told not, lost his life:
    So for her many a wight did die,
    As yon grim looks do testify.
    What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye
    I give, my cause who best can justify.

    Exit

SCENE I. Antioch. A room in the palace.

    Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers

ANTIOCHUS

    Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
    The danger of the task you undertake.

PERICLES

    I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul
    Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
    Think death no hazard in this enterprise.

ANTIOCHUS

    Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
    For the embracements even of Jove himself;
    At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
    Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
    The senate-house of planets all did sit,
    To knit in her their best perfections.

    Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS

PERICLES

    See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
    Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
    Of every virtue gives renown to men!
    Her face the book of praises, where is read
    Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
    Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
    Could never be her mild companion.
    You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
    That have inflamed desire in my breast
    To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,
    Or die in the adventure, be my helps,
    As I am son and servant to your will,
    To compass such a boundless happiness!

ANTIOCHUS

    Prince Pericles,--

PERICLES

    That would be son to great Antiochus.

ANTIOCHUS

    Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
    With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
    For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
    Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
    Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
    And which, without desert, because thine eye
    Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
    Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
    Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
    Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
    That without covering, save yon field of stars,
    Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
    And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
    For going on death's net, whom none resist.

PERICLES

    Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
    My frail mortality to know itself,
    And by those fearful objects to prepare
    This body, like to them, to what I must;
    For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
    Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
    I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do
    Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,
    Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;
    So I bequeath a happy peace to you
    And all good men, as every prince should do;
    My riches to the earth from whence they came;
    But my unspotted fire of love to you.

    To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
    Thus ready for the way of life or death,
    I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.

ANTIOCHUS

    Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:
    Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
    As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.

Daughter

    Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!
    Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!

PERICLES

    Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,
    Nor ask advice of any other thought
    But faithfulness and courage.

    He reads the riddle
    I am no viper, yet I feed
    On mother's flesh which did me breed.
    I sought a husband, in which labour
    I found that kindness in a father:
    He's father, son, and husband mild;
    I mother, wife, and yet his child.
    How they may be, and yet in two,
    As you will live, resolve it you.
    Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers
    That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
    Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
    If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
    Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,

    Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS
    Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:
    But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt
    For he's no man on whom perfections wait
    That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
    You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;
    Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,
    Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:
    But being play'd upon before your time,
    Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
    Good sooth, I care not for you.

ANTIOCHUS

    Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.
    For that's an article within our law,
    As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:
    Either expound now, or receive your sentence.

PERICLES

    Great king,
    Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
    'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
    Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
    He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:
    For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.
    Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;
    And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
    The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:
    To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
    Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
    By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.
    Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's
    their will;
    And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
    It is enough you know; and it is fit,
    What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
    All love the womb that their first being bred,
    Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.

ANTIOCHUS

    [Aside] Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found
    the meaning:
    But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,
    Though by the tenor of our strict edict,
    Your exposition misinterpreting,
    We might proceed to cancel of your days;
    Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
    As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:
    Forty days longer we do respite you;
    If by which time our secret be undone,
    This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:
    And until then your entertain shall be
    As doth befit our honour and your worth.

    Exeunt all but PERICLES

PERICLES

    How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
    When what is done is like an hypocrite,
    The which is good in nothing but in sight!
    If it be true that I interpret false,
    Then were it certain you were not so bad
    As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
    Where now you're both a father and a son,
    By your untimely claspings with your child,
    Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;
    And she an eater of her mother's flesh,
    By the defiling of her parent's bed;
    And both like serpents are, who though they feed
    On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
    Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
    Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
    Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
    One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
    Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:
    Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
    Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:
    Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,
    By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.

    Exit

    Re-enter ANTIOCHUS

ANTIOCHUS

    He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
    To have his head.
    He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
    Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
    In such a loathed manner;
    And therefore instantly this prince must die:
    For by his fall my honour must keep high.
    Who attends us there?

    Enter THALIARD

THALIARD

    Doth your highness call?

ANTIOCHUS

    Thaliard,
    You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes
    Her private actions to your secrecy;
    And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
    Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;
    We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:
    It fits thee not to ask the reason why,
    Because we bid it. Say, is it done?

THALIARD

    My lord,
    'Tis done.

ANTIOCHUS

    Enough.

    Enter a Messenger
    Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.

Messenger

    My lord, prince Pericles is fled.

    Exit

ANTIOCHUS

    As thou
    Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot
    From a well-experienced archer hits the mark
    His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return
    Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'

THALIARD

    My lord,
    If I can get him within my pistol's length,
    I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.

ANTIOCHUS

    Thaliard, adieu!

    Exit THALIARD
    Till Pericles be dead,
    My heart can lend no succor to my head.

    Exit

SCENE II. Tyre. A room in the palace.

    Enter PERICLES

PERICLES

    [To Lords without] Let none disturb us.--Why should
    this change of thoughts,
    The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,
    Be my so used a guest as not an hour,
    In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,
    The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
    Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
    And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,
    Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:
    Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
    Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
    Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
    That have their first conception by mis-dread,
    Have after-nourishment and life by care;
    And what was first but fear what might be done,
    Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
    And so with me: the great Antiochus,
    'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
    Since he's so great can make his will his act,
    Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
    Nor boots it me to say I honour him.
    If he suspect I may dishonour him:
    And what may make him blush in being known,
    He'll stop the course by which it might be known;
    With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
    And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
    Amazement shall drive courage from the state;
    Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
    And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
    Which care of them, not pity of myself,
    Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
    Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,
    Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,
    And punish that before that he would punish.

    Enter HELICANUS, with other Lords

First Lord

    Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!

Second Lord

    And keep your mind, till you return to us,
    Peaceful and comfortable!

HELICANUS

    Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
    They do abuse the king that flatter him:
    For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
    The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,
    To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;
    Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
    Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
    When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,
    He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
    Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;
    I cannot be much lower than my knees.

PERICLES

    All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook
    What shipping and what lading's in our haven,
    And then return to us.

    Exeunt Lords
    Helicanus, thou
    Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?

HELICANUS

    An angry brow, dread lord.

PERICLES

    If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
    How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?

HELICANUS

    How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence
    They have their nourishment?

PERICLES

    Thou know'st I have power
    To take thy life from thee.

HELICANUS

    [Kneeling]
    I have ground the axe myself;
    Do you but strike the blow.

PERICLES

    Rise, prithee, rise.
    Sit down: thou art no flatterer:
    I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
    That kings should let their ears hear their
    faults hid!
    Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
    Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,
    What wouldst thou have me do?

HELICANUS

    To bear with patience
    Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.

PERICLES

    Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
    That minister'st a potion unto me
    That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
    Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,
    Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,
    I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.
    From whence an issue I might propagate,
    Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.
    Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
    The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:
    Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
    Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou
    know'st this,
    'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
    Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
    Under the covering of a careful night,
    Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,
    Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
    I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
    Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
    And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
    That I should open to the listening air
    How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
    To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
    To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,
    And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:
    When all, for mine, if I may call offence,
    Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:
    Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
    Who now reprovest me for it,--

HELICANUS

    Alas, sir!

PERICLES

    Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
    Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
    How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
    And finding little comfort to relieve them,
    I thought it princely charity to grieve them.

HELICANUS

    Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.
    Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
    And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
    Who either by public war or private treason
    Will take away your life.
    Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
    Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
    Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
    Your rule direct to any; if to me.
    Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.

PERICLES

    I do not doubt thy faith;
    But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?

HELICANUS

    We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,
    From whence we had our being and our birth.

PERICLES

    Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus
    Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;
    And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
    The care I had and have of subjects' good
    On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
    I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:
    Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:
    But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,
    That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,
    Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Tyre. An ante-chamber in the palace.

    Enter THALIARD

THALIARD

    So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I
    kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to
    be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive
    he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,
    being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired
    he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he
    had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a
    villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to
    be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.

    Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of Tyre

HELICANUS

    You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
    Further to question me of your king's departure:
    His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,
    Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.

THALIARD

    [Aside] How! the king gone!

HELICANUS

    If further yet you will be satisfied,
    Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,
    He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.
    Being at Antioch--

THALIARD

    [Aside] What from Antioch?

HELICANUS

    Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--
    Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:
    And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,
    To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;
    So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
    With whom each minute threatens life or death.

THALIARD

    [Aside] Well, I perceive
    I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;
    But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:
    He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.
    I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!

HELICANUS

    Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.

THALIARD

    From him I come
    With message unto princely Pericles;
    But since my landing I have understood
    Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,
    My message must return from whence it came.

HELICANUS

    We have no reason to desire it,
    Commended to our master, not to us:
    Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,
    As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.

    Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA, and others

CLEON

    My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
    And by relating tales of others' griefs,
    See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?

DIONYZA

    That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
    For who digs hills because they do aspire
    Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
    O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;
    Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
    But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.

CLEON

    O Dionyza,
    Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
    Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
    Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
    Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,
    Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
    That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
    They may awake their helps to comfort them.
    I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
    And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.

DIONYZA

    I'll do my best, sir.

CLEON

    This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
    A city on whom plenty held full hand,
    For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
    Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
    And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;
    Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
    Like one another's glass to trim them by:
    Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
    And not so much to feed on as delight;
    All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
    The name of help grew odious to repeat.

DIONYZA

    O, 'tis too true.

CLEON

    But see what heaven can do! By this our change,
    These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
    Were all too little to content and please,
    Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
    As houses are defiled for want of use,
    They are now starved for want of exercise:
    Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
    Must have inventions to delight the taste,
    Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:
    Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
    Thought nought too curious, are ready now
    To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
    So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
    Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
    Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
    Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
    Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
    Is not this true?

DIONYZA

    Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.

CLEON

    O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
    And her prosperities so largely taste,
    With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!
    The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.

    Enter a Lord

Lord

    Where's the lord governor?

CLEON

    Here.
    Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
    For comfort is too far for us to expect.

Lord

    We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,
    A portly sail of ships make hitherward.

CLEON

    I thought as much.
    One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,
    That may succeed as his inheritor;
    And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,
    Taking advantage of our misery,
    Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,
    To beat us down, the which are down already;
    And make a conquest of unhappy me,
    Whereas no glory's got to overcome.

Lord

    That's the least fear; for, by the semblance
    Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,
    And come to us as favourers, not as foes.

CLEON

    Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:
    Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
    But bring they what they will and what they can,
    What need we fear?
    The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.
    Go tell their general we attend him here,
    To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
    And what he craves.

Lord

    I go, my lord.

    Exit

CLEON

    Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
    If wars, we are unable to resist.

    Enter PERICLES with Attendants

PERICLES

    Lord governor, for so we hear you are,
    Let not our ships and number of our men
    Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.
    We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,
    And seen the desolation of your streets:
    Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
    But to relieve them of their heavy load;
    And these our ships, you happily may think
    Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within
    With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,
    Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,
    And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.

All

    The gods of Greece protect you!
    And we'll pray for you.

PERICLES

    Arise, I pray you, rise:
    We do not look for reverence, but to love,
    And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.

CLEON

    The which when any shall not gratify,
    Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
    Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,
    The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
    Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--
    Your grace is welcome to our town and us.

PERICLES

    Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,
    Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.

    Exeunt

ACT II

    Enter GOWER

GOWER

    Here have you seen a mighty king
    His child, I wis, to incest bring;
    A better prince and benign lord,
    That will prove awful both in deed and word.
    Be quiet then as men should be,
    Till he hath pass'd necessity.
    I'll show you those in troubles reign,
    Losing a mite, a mountain gain.
    The good in conversation,
    To whom I give my benison,
    Is still at Tarsus, where each man
    Thinks all is writ he speken can;
    And, to remember what he does,
    Build his statue to make him glorious:
    But tidings to the contrary
    Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?
    DUMB SHOW.

    Enter at one door PERICLES talking with CLEON; all the train with them. Enter at another door a Gentleman, with a letter to PERICLES; PERICLES shows the letter to CLEON; gives the Messenger a reward, and knights him. Exit PERICLES at one door, and CLEON at another
    Good Helicane, that stay'd at home,
    Not to eat honey like a drone
    From others' labours; for though he strive
    To killen bad, keep good alive;
    And to fulfil his prince' desire,
    Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:
    How Thaliard came full bent with sin
    And had intent to murder him;
    And that in Tarsus was not best
    Longer for him to make his rest.
    He, doing so, put forth to seas,
    Where when men been, there's seldom ease;
    For now the wind begins to blow;
    Thunder above and deeps below
    Make such unquiet, that the ship
    Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;
    And he, good prince, having all lost,
    By waves from coast to coast is tost:
    All perishen of man, of pelf,
    Ne aught escapen but himself;
    Till fortune, tired with doing bad,
    Threw him ashore, to give him glad:
    And here he comes. What shall be next,
    Pardon old Gower,--this longs the text.

    Exit

SCENE I. Pentapolis. An open place by the sea-side.

    Enter PERICLES, wet

PERICLES

    Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!
    Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly man
    Is but a substance that must yield to you;
    And I, as fits my nature, do obey you:
    Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,
    Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breath
    Nothing to think on but ensuing death:
    Let it suffice the greatness of your powers
    To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;
    And having thrown him from your watery grave,
    Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.

    Enter three FISHERMEN

First Fisherman

    What, ho, Pilch!

Second Fisherman

    Ha, come and bring away the nets!

First Fisherman

    What, Patch-breech, I say!

Third Fisherman

    What say you, master?

First Fisherman

    Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or I'll
    fetch thee with a wanion.

Third Fisherman

    Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that
    were cast away before us even now.

First Fisherman

    Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what
    pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,
    well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.

Third Fisherman

    Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the
    porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say
    they're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,
    they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, I
    marvel how the fishes live in the sea.

First Fisherman

    Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the
    little ones: I can compare our rich misers to
    nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and
    tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at
    last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales
    have I heard on o' the land, who never leave gaping
    till they've swallowed the whole parish, church,
    steeple, bells, and all.

PERICLES

    [Aside] A pretty moral.

Third Fisherman

    But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have
    been that day in the belfry.

Second Fisherman

    Why, man?

Third Fisherman

    Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I
    had been in his belly, I would have kept such a
    jangling of the bells, that he should never have
    left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and
    parish up again. But if the good King Simonides
    were of my mind,--

PERICLES

    [Aside] Simonides!

Third Fisherman

    We would purge the land of these drones, that rob
    the bee of her honey.

PERICLES

    [Aside] How from the finny subject of the sea
    These fishers tell the infirmities of men;
    And from their watery empire recollect
    All that may men approve or men detect!
    Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen.

Second Fisherman

    Honest! good fellow, what's that? If it be a day
    fits you, search out of the calendar, and nobody
    look after it.

PERICLES

    May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.

Second Fisherman

    What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our
    way!

PERICLES

    A man whom both the waters and the wind,
    In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball
    For them to play upon, entreats you pity him:
    He asks of you, that never used to beg.

First Fisherman

    No, friend, cannot you beg? Here's them in our
    country Greece gets more with begging than we can do
    with working.

Second Fisherman

    Canst thou catch any fishes, then?

PERICLES

    I never practised it.

Second Fisherman

    Nay, then thou wilt starve, sure; for here's nothing
    to be got now-a-days, unless thou canst fish for't.

PERICLES

    What I have been I have forgot to know;
    But what I am, want teaches me to think on:
    A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are chill,
    And have no more of life than may suffice
    To give my tongue that heat to ask your help;
    Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,
    For that I am a man, pray see me buried.

First Fisherman

    Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here;
    come, put it on; keep thee warm. Now, afore me, a
    handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and
    we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for
    fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks,
    and thou shalt be welcome.

PERICLES

    I thank you, sir.

Second Fisherman

    Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg.

PERICLES

    I did but crave.

Second Fisherman

    But crave! Then I'll turn craver too, and so I
    shall 'scape whipping.

PERICLES

    Why, are all your beggars whipped, then?

Second Fisherman

    O, not all, my friend, not all; for if all your
    beggars were whipped, I would wish no better office
    than to be beadle. But, master, I'll go draw up the
    net.

    Exit with Third Fisherman

PERICLES

    [Aside] How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!

First Fisherman

    Hark you, sir, do you know where ye are?

PERICLES

    Not well.

First Fisherman

    Why, I'll tell you: this is called Pentapolis, and
    our king the good Simonides.

PERICLES

    The good King Simonides, do you call him.

First Fisherman

    Ay, sir; and he deserves so to be called for his
    peaceable reign and good government.

PERICLES

    He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects
    the name of good by his government. How far is his
    court distant from this shore?

First Fisherman

    Marry, sir, half a day's journey: and I'll tell
    you, he hath a fair daughter, and to-morrow is her
    birth-day; and there are princes and knights come
    from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.

PERICLES

    Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish
    to make one there.

First Fisherman

    O, sir, things must be as they may; and what a man
    cannot get, he may lawfully deal for--his wife's soul.

    Re-enter Second and Third Fishermen, drawing up a net

Second Fisherman

    Help, master, help! here's a fish hangs in the net,
    like a poor man's right in the law; 'twill hardly
    come out. Ha! bots on't, 'tis come at last, and
    'tis turned to a rusty armour.

PERICLES

    An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.
    Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,
    Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;
    And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,
    Which my dead father did bequeath to me.
    With this strict charge, even as he left his life,
    'Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield
    Twixt me and death;'--and pointed to this brace;--
    'For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity--
    The which the gods protect thee from!--may
    defend thee.'
    It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;
    Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,
    Took it in rage, though calm'd have given't again:
    I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,
    Since I have here my father's gift in's will.

First Fisherman

    What mean you, sir?

PERICLES

    To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,
    For it was sometime target to a king;
    I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,
    And for his sake I wish the having of it;
    And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,
    Where with it I may appear a gentleman;
    And if that ever my low fortune's better,
    I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.

First Fisherman

    Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?

PERICLES

    I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.

First Fisherman

    Why, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on't!

Second Fisherman

    Ay, but hark you, my friend; 'twas we that made up
    this garment through the rough seams of the waters:
    there are certain condolements, certain vails. I
    hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from
    whence you had it.

PERICLES

    Believe 't, I will.
    By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;
    And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,
    This jewel holds his building on my arm:
    Unto thy value I will mount myself
    Upon a courser, whose delightful steps
    Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
    Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided
    Of a pair of bases.

Second Fisherman

    We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to
    make thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.

PERICLES

    Then honour be but a goal to my will,
    This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. A public way or platform leading to the

    lists. A pavilion by the side of it for the
    reception of King, Princess, Lords, & c.

    Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, and Attendants

SIMONIDES

    Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?

First Lord

    They are, my liege;
    And stay your coming to present themselves.

SIMONIDES

    Return them, we are ready; and our daughter,
    In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,
    Sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat
    For men to see, and seeing wonder at.

    Exit a Lord

THAISA

    It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express
    My commendations great, whose merit's less.

SIMONIDES

    It's fit it should be so; for princes are
    A model which heaven makes like to itself:
    As jewels lose their glory if neglected,
    So princes their renowns if not respected.
    'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain
    The labour of each knight in his device.

THAISA

    Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.

    Enter a Knight; he passes over, and his Squire presents his shield to the Princess

SIMONIDES

    Who is the first that doth prefer himself?

THAISA

    A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;
    And the device he bears upon his shield
    Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun
    The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.'

SIMONIDES

    He loves you well that holds his life of you.

    The Second Knight passes over
    Who is the second that presents himself?

THAISA

    A prince of Macedon, my royal father;
    And the device he bears upon his shield
    Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;
    The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'

    The Third Knight passes over

SIMONIDES

    And what's the third?

THAISA

    The third of Antioch;
    And his device, a wreath of chivalry;
    The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'

    The Fourth Knight passes over

SIMONIDES

    What is the fourth?

THAISA

    A burning torch that's turned upside down;
    The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.'

SIMONIDES

    Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,
    Which can as well inflame as it can kill.

    The Fifth Knight passes over

THAISA

    The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,
    Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;
    The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'

    The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over

SIMONIDES

    And what's
    The sixth and last, the which the knight himself
    With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?

THAISA

    He seems to be a stranger; but his present is
    A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
    The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'

SIMONIDES

    A pretty moral;
    From the dejected state wherein he is,
    He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.

First Lord

    He had need mean better than his outward show
    Can any way speak in his just commend;
    For by his rusty outside he appears
    To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.

Second Lord

    He well may be a stranger, for he comes
    To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.

Third Lord

    And on set purpose let his armour rust
    Until this day, to scour it in the dust.

SIMONIDES

    Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
    The outward habit by the inward man.
    But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw
    Into the gallery.

    Exeunt

    Great shouts within and all cry 'The mean knight!'

SCENE III. The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.

    Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and Knights, from tilting

SIMONIDES

    Knights,
    To say you're welcome were superfluous.
    To place upon the volume of your deeds,
    As in a title-page, your worth in arms,
    Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,
    Since every worth in show commends itself.
    Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:
    You are princes and my guests.

THAISA

    But you, my knight and guest;
    To whom this wreath of victory I give,
    And crown you king of this day's happiness.

PERICLES

    'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.

SIMONIDES

    Call it by what you will, the day is yours;
    And here, I hope, is none that envies it.
    In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,
    To make some good, but others to exceed;
    And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'
    the feast,--
    For, daughter, so you are,--here take your place:
    Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.

KNIGHTS

    We are honour'd much by good Simonides.

SIMONIDES

    Your presence glads our days: honour we love;
    For who hates honour hates the gods above.

Marshal

    Sir, yonder is your place.

PERICLES

    Some other is more fit.

First Knight

    Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen
    That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
    Envy the great nor do the low despise.

PERICLES

    You are right courteous knights.

SIMONIDES

    Sit, sir, sit.

PERICLES

    By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,
    These cates resist me, she but thought upon.

THAISA

    By Juno, that is queen of marriage,
    All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.
    Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.

SIMONIDES

    He's but a country gentleman;
    Has done no more than other knights have done;
    Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.

THAISA

    To me he seems like diamond to glass.

PERICLES

    Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,
    Which tells me in that glory once he was;
    Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,
    And he the sun, for them to reverence;
    None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,
    Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:
    Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,
    The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:
    Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,
    He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
    And gives them what he will, not what they crave.

SIMONIDES

    What, are you merry, knights?

Knights

    Who can be other in this royal presence?

SIMONIDES

    Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
    As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--
    We drink this health to you.

KNIGHTS

    We thank your grace.

SIMONIDES

    Yet pause awhile:
    Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,
    As if the entertainment in our court
    Had not a show might countervail his worth.
    Note it not you, Thaisa?

THAISA

    What is it
    To me, my father?

SIMONIDES

    O, attend, my daughter:
    Princes in this should live like gods above,
    Who freely give to every one that comes
    To honour them:
    And princes not doin g so are like to gnats,
    Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.
    Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,
    Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.

THAISA

    Alas, my father, it befits not me
    Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:
    He may my proffer take for an offence,
    Since men take women's gifts for impudence.

SIMONIDES

    How!
    Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.

THAISA

    [Aside] Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.

SIMONIDES

    And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,
    Of whence he is, his name and parentage.

THAISA

    The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.

PERICLES

    I thank him.

THAISA

    Wishing it so much blood unto your life.

PERICLES

    I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.

THAISA

    And further he desires to know of you,
    Of whence you are, your name and parentage.

PERICLES

    A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;
    My education been in arts and arms;
    Who, looking for adventures in the world,
    Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,
    And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.

THAISA

    He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,
    A gentleman of Tyre,
    Who only by misfortune of the seas
    Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.

SIMONIDES

    Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,
    And will awake him from his melancholy.
    Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,
    And waste the time, which looks for other revels.
    Even in your armours, as you are address'd,
    Will very well become a soldier's dance.
    I will not have excuse, with saying this
    Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
    Since they love men in arms as well as beds.

    The Knights dance
    So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.
    Come, sir;
    Here is a lady that wants breathing too:
    And I have heard, you knights of Tyre
    Are excellent in making ladies trip;
    And that their measures are as excellent.

PERICLES

    In those that practise them they are, my lord.

SIMONIDES

    O, that's as much as you would be denied
    Of your fair courtesy.

    The Knights and Ladies dance
    Unclasp, unclasp:
    Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.

    To PERICLES
    But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct
    These knights unto their several lodgings!

    To PERICLES
    Yours, sir,
    We have given order to be next our own.

PERICLES

    I am at your grace's pleasure.

SIMONIDES

    Princes, it is too late to talk of love;
    And that's the mark I know you level at:
    Therefore each one betake him to his rest;
    To-morrow all for speeding do their best.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Tyre. A room in the Governor's house.

    Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES

HELICANUS

    No, Escanes, know this of me,
    Antiochus from incest lived not free:
    For which, the most high gods not minding longer
    To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,
    Due to this heinous capital offence,
    Even in the height and pride of all his glory,
    When he was seated in a chariot
    Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,
    A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
    Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,
    That all those eyes adored them ere their fall
    Scorn now their hand should give them burial.

ESCANES

    'Twas very strange.

HELICANUS

    And yet but justice; for though
    This king were great, his greatness was no guard
    To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward.

ESCANES

    'Tis very true.

    Enter two or three Lords

First Lord

    See, not a man in private conference
    Or council has respect with him but he.

Second Lord

    It shall no longer grieve without reproof.

Third Lord

    And cursed be he that will not second it.

First Lord

    Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.

HELICANUS

    With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.

First Lord

    Know that our griefs are risen to the top,
    And now at length they overflow their banks.

HELICANUS

    Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.

First Lord

    Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane;
    But if the prince do live, let us salute him,
    Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
    If in the world he live, we'll seek him out;
    If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there;
    And be resolved he lives to govern us,
    Or dead, give's cause to mourn his funeral,
    And leave us to our free election.

Second Lord

    Whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure:
    And knowing this kingdom is without a head,--
    Like goodly buildings left without a roof
    Soon fall to ruin,--your noble self,
    That best know how to rule and how to reign,
    We thus submit unto,--our sovereign.

All

    Live, noble Helicane!

HELICANUS

    For honour's cause, forbear your suffrages:
    If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.
    Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,
    Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.
    A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you to
    Forbear the absence of your king:
    If in which time expired, he not return,
    I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
    But if I cannot win you to this love,
    Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
    And in your search spend your adventurous worth;
    Whom if you find, and win unto return,
    You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.

First Lord

    To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;
    And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,
    We with our travels will endeavour us.

HELICANUS

    Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:
    When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Pentapolis. A room in the palace.

    Enter SIMONIDES, reading a letter, at one door: the Knights meet him

First Knight

    Good morrow to the good Simonides.

SIMONIDES

    Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,
    That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
    A married life.
    Her reason to herself is only known,
    Which yet from her by no means can I get.

Second Knight

    May we not get access to her, my lord?

SIMONIDES

    'Faith, by no means; she has so strictly tied
    Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible.
    One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery;
    This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd
    And on her virgin honour will not break it.

Third Knight

    Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.

    Exeunt Knights

SIMONIDES

    So,
    They are well dispatch'd; now to my daughter's letter:
    She tells me here, she'd wed the stranger knight,
    Or never more to view nor day nor light.
    'Tis well, mistress; your choice agrees with mine;
    I like that well: nay, how absolute she's in't,
    Not minding whether I dislike or no!
    Well, I do commend her choice;
    And will no longer have it be delay'd.
    Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.

    Enter PERICLES

PERICLES

    All fortune to the good Simonides!

SIMONIDES

    To you as much, sir! I am beholding to you
    For your sweet music this last night: I do
    Protest my ears were never better fed
    With such delightful pleasing harmony.

PERICLES

    It is your grace's pleasure to commend;
    Not my desert.

SIMONIDES

    Sir, you are music's master.

PERICLES

    The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.

SIMONIDES

    Let me ask you one thing:
    What do you think of my daughter, sir?

PERICLES

    A most virtuous princess.

SIMONIDES

    And she is fair too, is she not?

PERICLES

    As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.

SIMONIDES

    Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you;
    Ay, so well, that you must be her master,
    And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.

PERICLES

    I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.

SIMONIDES

    She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.

PERICLES

    [Aside] What's here?
    A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!
    'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.
    O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,
    A stranger and distressed gentleman,
    That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,
    But bent all offices to honour her.

SIMONIDES

    Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art
    A villain.

PERICLES

    By the gods, I have not:
    Never did thought of mine levy offence;
    Nor never did my actions yet commence
    A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.

SIMONIDES

    Traitor, thou liest.

PERICLES

    Traitor!

SIMONIDES

    Ay, traitor.

PERICLES

    Even in his throat--unless it be the king--
    That calls me traitor, I return the lie.

SIMONIDES

    [Aside] Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.

PERICLES

    My actions are as noble as my thoughts,
    That never relish'd of a base descent.
    I came unto your court for honour's cause,
    And not to be a rebel to her state;
    And he that otherwise accounts of me,
    This sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.

SIMONIDES

    No?
    Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.

    Enter THAISA

PERICLES

    Then, as you are as virtuous as fair,
    Resolve your angry father, if my tongue
    Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe
    To any syllable that made love to you.

THAISA

    Why, sir, say if you had,
    Who takes offence at that would make me glad?

SIMONIDES

    Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?

    Aside
    I am glad on't with all my heart.--
    I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.
    Will you, not having my consent,
    Bestow your love and your affections
    Upon a stranger?

    Aside
    who, for aught I know,
    May be, nor can I think the contrary,
    As great in blood as I myself.--
    Therefore hear you, mistress; either frame
    Your will to mine,--and you, sir, hear you,
    Either be ruled by me, or I will make you--
    Man and wife:
    Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:
    And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;
    And for a further grief,--God give you joy!--
    What, are you both pleased?

THAISA

    Yes, if you love me, sir.

PERICLES

    Even as my life, or blood that fosters it.

SIMONIDES

    What, are you both agreed?

BOTH

    Yes, if it please your majesty.

SIMONIDES

    It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed;
    And then with what haste you can get you to bed.

    Exeunt

ACT III

    Enter GOWER

GOWER

    Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout;
    No din but snores the house about,
    Made louder by the o'er-fed breast
    Of this most pompous marriage-feast.
    The cat, with eyne of burning coal,
    Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;
    And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,
    E'er the blither for their drouth.
    Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.
    Where, by the loss of maidenhead,
    A babe is moulded. Be attent,
    And time that is so briefly spent
    With your fine fancies quaintly eche:
    What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.
    DUMB SHOW.

    Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The KING shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt SIMONIDES and the rest
    By many a dern and painful perch
    Of Pericles the careful search,
    By the four opposing coigns
    Which the world together joins,
    Is made with all due diligence
    That horse and sail and high expense
    Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,
    Fame answering the most strange inquire,
    To the court of King Simonides
    Are letters brought, the tenor these:
    Antiochus and his daughter dead;
    The men of Tyrus on the head
    Of Helicanus would set on
    The crown of Tyre, but he will none:
    The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;
    Says to 'em, if King Pericles
    Come not home in twice six moons,
    He, obedient to their dooms,
    Will take the crown. The sum of this,
    Brought hither to Pentapolis,
    Y-ravished the regions round,
    And every one with claps can sound,
    'Our heir-apparent is a king!
    Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'
    Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:
    His queen with child makes her desire--
    Which who shall cross?--along to go:
    Omit we all their dole and woe:
    Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
    And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
    On Neptune's billow; half the flood
    Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood
    Varies again; the grisly north
    Disgorges such a tempest forth,
    That, as a duck for life that dives,
    So up and down the poor ship drives:
    The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
    Does fall in travail with her fear:
    And what ensues in this fell storm
    Shall for itself itself perform.
    I nill relate, action may
    Conveniently the rest convey;
    Which might not what by me is told.
    In your imagination hold
    This stage the ship, upon whose deck
    The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.

    Exit
    SCENE I:

    Enter PERICLES, on shipboard

PERICLES

    Thou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges,
    Which wash both heaven and hell; and thou, that hast
    Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
    Having call'd them from the deep! O, still
    Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench
    Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,
    How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously;
    Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistle
    Is as a whisper in the ears of death,
    Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina, O
    Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle
    To those that cry by night, convey thy deity
    Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs
    Of my queen's travails!

    Enter LYCHORIDA, with an Infant
    Now, Lychorida!

LYCHORIDA

    Here is a thing too young for such a place,
    Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I
    Am like to do: take in your arms this piece
    Of your dead queen.

PERICLES

    How, how, Lychorida!

LYCHORIDA

    Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.
    Here's all that is left living of your queen,
    A little daughter: for the sake of it,
    Be manly, and take comfort.

PERICLES

    O you gods!
    Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,
    And snatch them straight away? We here below
    Recall not what we give, and therein may
    Use honour with you.

LYCHORIDA

    Patience, good sir,
    Even for this charge.

PERICLES

    Now, mild may be thy life!
    For a more blustrous birth had never babe:
    Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for
    Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
    That ever was prince's child. Happy what follows!
    Thou hast as chiding a nativity
    As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,
    To herald thee from the womb: even at the first
    Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,
    With all thou canst find here. Now, the good gods
    Throw their best eyes upon't!

    Enter two Sailors

First Sailor

    What courage, sir? God save you!

PERICLES

    Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;
    It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love
    Of this poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer,
    I would it would be quiet.

First Sailor

    Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?
    Blow, and split thyself.

Second Sailor

    But sea-room, an the brine and cloudy billow kiss
    the moon, I care not.

First Sailor

    Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,
    the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be
    cleared of the dead.

PERICLES

    That's your superstition.

First Sailor

    Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still
    observed: and we are strong in custom. Therefore
    briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.

PERICLES

    As you think meet. Most wretched queen!

LYCHORIDA

    Here she lies, sir.

PERICLES

    A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear;
    No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements
    Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time
    To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight
    Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;
    Where, for a monument upon thy bones,
    And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale
    And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,
    Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,
    Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,
    My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander
    Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe
    Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say
    A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.

    Exit LYCHORIDA

Second Sailor

    Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked
    and bitumed ready.

PERICLES

    I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this?

Second Sailor

    We are near Tarsus.

PERICLES

    Thither, gentle mariner.
    Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?

Second Sailor

    By break of day, if the wind cease.

PERICLES

    O, make for Tarsus!
    There will I visit Cleon, for the babe
    Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I'll leave it
    At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner:
    I'll bring the body presently.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house.

    Enter CERIMON, with a Servant, and some Persons who have been shipwrecked

CERIMON

    Philemon, ho!

    Enter PHILEMON

PHILEMON

    Doth my lord call?

CERIMON

    Get fire and meat for these poor men:
    'T has been a turbulent and stormy night.

Servant

    I have been in many; but such a night as this,
    Till now, I ne'er endured.

CERIMON

    Your master will be dead ere you return;
    There's nothing can be minister'd to nature
    That can recover him.

    To PHILEMON
    Give this to the 'pothecary,
    And tell me how it works.

    Exeunt all but CERIMON

    Enter two Gentlemen

First Gentleman

    Good morrow.

Second Gentleman

    Good morrow to your lordship.

CERIMON

    Gentlemen,
    Why do you stir so early?

First Gentleman

    Sir,
    Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,
    Shook as the earth did quake;
    The very principals did seem to rend,
    And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear
    Made me to quit the house.

Second Gentleman

    That is the cause we trouble you so early;
    'Tis not our husbandry.

CERIMON

    O, you say well.

First Gentleman

    But I much marvel that your lordship, having
    Rich tire about you, should at these early hours
    Shake off the golden slumber of repose.
    'Tis most strange,
    Nature should be so conversant with pain,
    Being thereto not compell'd.

CERIMON

    I hold it ever,
    Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
    Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs
    May the two latter darken and expend;
    But immortality attends the former.
    Making a man a god. 'Tis known, I ever
    Have studied physic, through which secret art,
    By turning o'er authorities, I have,
    Together with my practise, made familiar
    To me and to my aid the blest infusions
    That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
    And I can speak of the disturbances
    That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me
    A more content in course of true delight
    Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,
    Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
    To please the fool and death.

Second Gentleman

    Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
    Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
    Your creatures, who by you have been restored:
    And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even
    Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon
    Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.

    Enter two or three Servants with a chest

First Servant

    So; lift there.

CERIMON

    What is that?

First Servant

    Sir, even now
    Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest:
    'Tis of some wreck.

CERIMON

    Set 't down, let's look upon't.

Second Gentleman

    'Tis like a coffin, sir.

CERIMON

    Whate'er it be,
    'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:
    If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,
    'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.

Second Gentleman

    'Tis so, my lord.

CERIMON

    How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!
    Did the sea cast it up?

First Servant

    I never saw so huge a billow, sir,
    As toss'd it upon shore.

CERIMON

    Wrench it open;
    Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.

Second Gentleman

    A delicate odour.

CERIMON

    As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.
    O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!

First Gentleman

    Most strange!

CERIMON

    Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasured
    With full bags of spices! A passport too!
    Apollo, perfect me in the characters!

    Reads from a scroll
    'Here I give to understand,
    If e'er this coffin drive a-land,
    I, King Pericles, have lost
    This queen, worth all our mundane cost.
    Who finds her, give her burying;
    She was the daughter of a king:
    Besides this treasure for a fee,
    The gods requite his charity!'
    If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart
    That even cracks for woe! This chanced tonight.

Second Gentleman

    Most likely, sir.

CERIMON

    Nay, certainly to-night;
    For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
    That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within:
    Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.

    Exit a Servant
    Death may usurp on nature many hours,
    And yet the fire of life kindle again
    The o'erpress'd spirits. I heard of an Egyptian
    That had nine hours lien dead,
    Who was by good appliance recovered.

    Re-enter a Servant, with boxes, napkins, and fire
    Well said, well said; the fire and cloths.
    The rough and woeful music that we have,
    Cause it to sound, beseech you.
    The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!
    The music there!--I pray you, give her air.
    Gentlemen.
    This queen will live: nature awakes; a warmth
    Breathes out of her: she hath not been entranced
    Above five hours: see how she gins to blow
    Into life's flower again!

First Gentleman

    The heavens,
    Through you, increase our wonder and set up
    Your fame forever.

CERIMON

    She is alive; behold,
    Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels
    Which Pericles hath lost,
    Begin to part their fringes of bright gold;
    The diamonds of a most praised water
    Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
    And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,
    Rare as you seem to be.

    She moves

THAISA

    O dear Diana,
    Where am I? Where's my lord? What world is this?

Second Gentleman

    Is not this strange?

First Gentleman

    Most rare.

CERIMON

    Hush, my gentle neighbours!
    Lend me your hands; to the next chamber bear her.
    Get linen: now this matter must be look'd to,
    For her relapse is mortal. Come, come;
    And AEsculapius guide us!

    Exeunt, carrying her away

SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.

    Enter PERICLES, CLEON, DIONYZA, and LYCHORIDA with MARINA in her arms

PERICLES

    Most honour'd Cleon, I must needs be gone;
    My twelve months are expired, and Tyrus stands
    In a litigious peace. You, and your lady,
    Take from my heart all thankfulness! The gods
    Make up the rest upon you!

CLEON

    Your shafts of fortune, though they hurt you mortally,
    Yet glance full wanderingly on us.

DIONYZA

    O your sweet queen!
    That the strict fates had pleased you had brought her hither,
    To have bless'd mine eyes with her!

PERICLES

    We cannot but obey
    The powers above us. Could I rage and roar
    As doth the sea she lies in, yet the end
    Must be as 'tis. My gentle babe Marina, whom,
    For she was born at sea, I have named so, here
    I charge your charity withal, leaving her
    The infant of your care; beseeching you
    To give her princely training, that she may be
    Manner'd as she is born.

CLEON

    Fear not, my lord, but think
    Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
    For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,
    Must in your child be thought on. If neglection
    Should therein make me vile, the common body,
    By you relieved, would force me to my duty:
    But if to that my nature need a spur,
    The gods revenge it upon me and mine,
    To the end of generation!

PERICLES

    I believe you;
    Your honour and your goodness teach me to't,
    Without your vows. Till she be married, madam,
    By bright Diana, whom we honour, all
    Unscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain,
    Though I show ill in't. So I take my leave.
    Good madam, make me blessed in your care
    In bringing up my child.

DIONYZA

    I have one myself,
    Who shall not be more dear to my respect
    Than yours, my lord.

PERICLES

    Madam, my thanks and prayers.

CLEON

    We'll bring your grace e'en to the edge o' the shore,
    Then give you up to the mask'd Neptune and
    The gentlest winds of heaven.

PERICLES

    I will embrace
    Your offer. Come, dearest madam. O, no tears,
    Lychorida, no tears:
    Look to your little mistress, on whose grace
    You may depend hereafter. Come, my lord.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Ephesus. A room in CERIMON's house.

    Enter CERIMON and THAISA

CERIMON

    Madam, this letter, and some certain jewels,
    Lay with you in your coffer: which are now
    At your command. Know you the character?

THAISA

    It is my lord's.
    That I was shipp'd at sea, I well remember,
    Even on my eaning time; but whether there
    Deliver'd, by the holy gods,
    I cannot rightly say. But since King Pericles,
    My wedded lord, I ne'er shall see again,
    A vestal livery will I take me to,
    And never more have joy.

CERIMON

    Madam, if this you purpose as ye speak,
    Diana's temple is not distant far,
    Where you may abide till your date expire.
    Moreover, if you please, a niece of mine
    Shall there attend you.

THAISA

    My recompense is thanks, that's all;
    Yet my good will is great, though the gift small.

    Exeunt

ACT IV

    Enter GOWER

GOWER

    Imagine Pericles arrived at Tyre,
    Welcomed and settled to his own desire.
    His woeful queen we leave at Ephesus,
    Unto Diana there a votaress.
    Now to Marina bend your mind,
    Whom our fast-growing scene must find
    At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd
    In music, letters; who hath gain'd
    Of education all the grace,
    Which makes her both the heart and place
    Of general wonder. But, alack,
    That monster envy, oft the wrack
    Of earned praise, Marina's life
    Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
    And in this kind hath our Cleon
    One daughter, and a wench full grown,
    Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid
    Hight Philoten: and it is said
    For certain in our story, she
    Would ever with Marina be:
    Be't when she weaved the sleided silk
    With fingers long, small, white as milk;
    Or when she would with sharp needle wound
    The cambric, which she made more sound
    By hurting it; or when to the lute
    She sung, and made the night-bird mute,
    That still records with moan; or when
    She would with rich and constant pen
    Vail to her mistress Dian; still
    This Philoten contends in skill
    With absolute Marina: so
    With the dove of Paphos might the crow
    Vie feathers white. Marina gets
    All praises, which are paid as debts,
    And not as given. This so darks
    In Philoten all graceful marks,
    That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,
    A present murderer does prepare
    For good Marina, that her daughter
    Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
    The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
    Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:
    And cursed Dionyza hath
    The pregnant instrument of wrath
    Prest for this blow. The unborn event
    I do commend to your content:
    Only I carry winged time
    Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;
    Which never could I so convey,
    Unless your thoughts went on my way.
    Dionyza does appear,
    With Leonine, a murderer.

    Exit

SCENE I. Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore.

    Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE

DIONYZA

    Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:
    'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
    Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,
    To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
    Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
    Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which
    Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be
    A soldier to thy purpose.

LEONINE

    I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.

DIONYZA

    The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here
    she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
    Thou art resolved?

LEONINE

    I am resolved.

    Enter MARINA, with a basket of flowers

MARINA

    No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,
    To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,
    The purple violets, and marigolds,
    Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
    While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,
    Born in a tempest, when my mother died,
    This world to me is like a lasting storm,
    Whirring me from my friends.

DIONYZA

    How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?
    How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
    Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have
    A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed
    With this unprofitable woe!
    Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
    Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,
    And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
    Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.

MARINA

    No, I pray you;
    I'll not bereave you of your servant.

DIONYZA

    Come, come;
    I love the king your father, and yourself,
    With more than foreign heart. We every day
    Expect him here: when he shall come and find
    Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
    He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;
    Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
    No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
    Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve
    That excellent complexion, which did steal
    The eyes of young and old. Care not for me
    I can go home alone.

MARINA

    Well, I will go;
    But yet I have no desire to it.

DIONYZA

    Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.
    Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:
    Remember what I have said.

LEONINE

    I warrant you, madam.

DIONYZA

    I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:
    Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:
    What! I must have a care of you.

MARINA

    My thanks, sweet madam.

    Exit DIONYZA
    Is this wind westerly that blows?

LEONINE

    South-west.

MARINA

    When I was born, the wind was north.

LEONINE

    Was't so?

MARINA

    My father, as nurse said, did never fear,
    But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling
    His kingly hands, haling ropes;
    And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea
    That almost burst the deck.

LEONINE

    When was this?

MARINA

    When I was born:
    Never was waves nor wind more violent;
    And from the ladder-tackle washes off
    A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'
    And with a dropping industry they skip
    From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and
    The master calls, and trebles their confusion.

LEONINE

    Come, say your prayers.

MARINA

    What mean you?

LEONINE

    If you require a little space for prayer,
    I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,
    For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn
    To do my work with haste.

MARINA

    Why will you kill me?

LEONINE

    To satisfy my lady.

MARINA

    Why would she have me kill'd?
    Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
    I never did her hurt in all my life:
    I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
    To any living creature: believe me, la,
    I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:
    I trod upon a worm against my will,
    But I wept for it. How have I offended,
    Wherein my death might yield her any profit,
    Or my life imply her any danger?

LEONINE

    My commission
    Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.

MARINA

    You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
    You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow
    You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,
    When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:
    Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:
    Your lady seeks my life; come you between,
    And save poor me, the weaker.

LEONINE

    I am sworn,
    And will dispatch.

    He seizes her

    Enter Pirates

First Pirate

    Hold, villain!

    LEONINE runs away

Second Pirate

    A prize! a prize!

Third Pirate

    Half-part, mates, half-part.
    Come, let's have her aboard suddenly.

    Exeunt Pirates with MARINA

    Re-enter LEONINE

LEONINE

    These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;
    And they have seized Marina. Let her go:
    There's no hope she will return. I'll swear
    she's dead,
    And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:
    Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
    Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
    Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.

    Exit

SCENE II. Mytilene. A room in a brothel.

    Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT

Pandar

    Boult!

BOULT

    Sir?

Pandar

    Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of
    gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being
    too wenchless.

Bawd

    We were never so much out of creatures. We have but
    poor three, and they can do no more than they can
    do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.

Pandar

    Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for
    them. If there be not a conscience to be used in
    every trade, we shall never prosper.

Bawd

    Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor
    bastards,--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--

BOULT

    Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But
    shall I search the market?

Bawd

    What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind
    will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.

Pandar

    Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'
    conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that
    lay with the little baggage.

BOULT

    Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat
    for worms. But I'll go search the market.

    Exit

Pandar

    Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a
    proportion to live quietly, and so give over.

Bawd

    Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get
    when we are old?

Pandar

    O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor
    the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,
    if in our youths we could pick up some pretty
    estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.
    Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods
    will be strong with us for giving over.

Bawd

    Come, other sorts offend as well as we.

Pandar

    As well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse.
    Neither is our profession any trade; it's no
    calling. But here comes Boult.

    Re-enter BOULT, with the Pirates and MARINA

BOULT

    [To MARINA] Come your ways. My masters, you say
    she's a virgin?

First Pirate

    O, sir, we doubt it not.

BOULT

    Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see:
    if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.

Bawd

    Boult, has she any qualities?

BOULT

    She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent
    good clothes: there's no further necessity of
    qualities can make her be refused.

Bawd

    What's her price, Boult?

BOULT

    I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.

Pandar

    Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your
    money presently. Wife, take her in; instruct her
    what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her
    entertainment.

    Exeunt Pandar and Pirates

Bawd

    Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her
    hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her
    virginity; and cry 'He that will give most shall
    have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap
    thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done
    as I command you.

BOULT

    Performance shall follow.

    Exit

MARINA

    Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!
    He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,
    Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me
    For to seek my mother!

Bawd

    Why lament you, pretty one?

MARINA

    That I am pretty.

Bawd

    Come, the gods have done their part in you.

MARINA

    I accuse them not.

Bawd

    You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.

MARINA

    The more my fault
    To scape his hands where I was like to die.

Bawd

    Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.

MARINA

    No.

Bawd

    Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all
    fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the
    difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?

MARINA

    Are you a woman?

Bawd

    What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?

MARINA

    An honest woman, or not a woman.

Bawd

    Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have
    something to do with you. Come, you're a young
    foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have
    you.

MARINA

    The gods defend me!

Bawd

    If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men
    must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir
    you up. Boult's returned.

    Re-enter BOULT
    Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?

BOULT

    I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;
    I have drawn her picture with my voice.

Bawd

    And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the
    inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?

BOULT

    'Faith, they listened to me as they would have
    hearkened to their father's testament. There was a
    Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to
    her very description.

Bawd

    We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.

BOULT

    To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the
    French knight that cowers i' the hams?

Bawd

    Who, Monsieur Veroles?

BOULT

    Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the
    proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore
    he would see her to-morrow.

Bawd

    Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease
    hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will
    come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the
    sun.

BOULT

    Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we
    should lodge them with this sign.

Bawd

    [To MARINA] Pray you, come hither awhile. You
    have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must
    seem to do that fearfully which you commit
    willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.
    To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your
    lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good
    opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.

MARINA

    I understand you not.

BOULT

    O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these
    blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.

Bawd

    Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your
    bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go
    with warrant.

BOULT

    'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if
    I have bargained for the joint,--

Bawd

    Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.

BOULT

    I may so.

Bawd

    Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the
    manner of your garments well.

BOULT

    Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.

Bawd

    Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a
    sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.
    When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good
    turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou
    hast the harvest out of thine own report.

BOULT

    I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake
    the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up
    the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.

Bawd

    Come your ways; follow me.

MARINA

    If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,
    Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
    Diana, aid my purpose!

Bawd

    What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.

    Enter CLEON and DIONYZA

DIONYZA

    Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?

CLEON

    O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
    The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!

DIONYZA

    I think
    You'll turn a child again.

CLEON

    Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
    I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,
    Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
    To equal any single crown o' the earth
    I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!
    Whom thou hast poison'd too:
    If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness
    Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say
    When noble Pericles shall demand his child?

DIONYZA

    That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
    To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
    She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
    Unless you play the pious innocent,
    And for an honest attribute cry out
    'She died by foul play.'

CLEON

    O, go to. Well, well,
    Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
    Do like this worst.

DIONYZA

    Be one of those that think
    The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,
    And open this to Pericles. I do shame
    To think of what a noble strain you are,
    And of how coward a spirit.

CLEON

    To such proceeding
    Who ever but his approbation added,
    Though not his prime consent, he did not flow
    From honourable sources.

DIONYZA

    Be it so, then:
    Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
    Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
    She did disdain my child, and stood between
    Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
    But cast their gazes on Marina's face;
    Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
    Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;
    And though you call my course unnatural,
    You not your child well loving, yet I find
    It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
    Perform'd to your sole daughter.

CLEON

    Heavens forgive it!

DIONYZA

    And as for Pericles,
    What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
    And yet we mourn: her monument
    Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
    In glittering golden characters express
    A general praise to her, and care in us
    At whose expense 'tis done.

CLEON

    Thou art like the harpy,
    Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,
    Seize with thine eagle's talons.

DIONYZA

    You are like one that superstitiously
    Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:
    But yet I know you'll do as I advise.

    Exeunt
    SCENE IV:

    Enter GOWER, before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus

GOWER

    Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;
    Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;
    Making, to take your imagination,
    From bourn to bourn, region to region.
    By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime
    To use one language in each several clime
    Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you
    To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,
    The stages of our story. Pericles
    Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
    Attended on by many a lord and knight.
    To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
    Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
    Advanced in time to great and high estate,
    Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,
    Old Helicanus goes along behind.
    Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
    This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;
    So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--
    To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
    Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;
    Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.
    DUMB SHOW.

    Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train; CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA
    See how belief may suffer by foul show!
    This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;
    And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,
    With sighs shot through, and biggest tears
    o'ershower'd,
    Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears
    Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
    He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
    A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
    And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.
    The epitaph is for Marina writ
    By wicked Dionyza.

    Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument
    'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,
    Who wither'd in her spring of year.
    She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,
    On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;
    Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,
    Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:
    Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,
    Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:
    Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,
    Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'
    No visor does become black villany
    So well as soft and tender flattery.
    Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
    And bear his courses to be ordered
    By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play
    His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
    In her unholy service. Patience, then,
    And think you now are all in Mytilene.

    Exit

SCENE V. Mytilene. A street before the brothel.

    Enter, from the brothel, two Gentlemen

First Gentleman

    Did you ever hear the like?

Second Gentleman

    No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she
    being once gone.

First Gentleman

    But to have divinity preached there! did you ever
    dream of such a thing?

Second Gentleman

    No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses:
    shall's go hear the vestals sing?

First Gentleman

    I'll do any thing now that is virtuous; but I
    am out of the road of rutting for ever.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. The same. A room in the brothel.

    Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT

Pandar

    Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she
    had ne'er come here.

Bawd

    Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god
    Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must
    either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she
    should do for clients her fitment, and do me the
    kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,
    her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her
    knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,
    if he should cheapen a kiss of her.

BOULT

    'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us
    of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.

Pandar

    Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!

Bawd

    'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the
    way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.

BOULT

    We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish
    baggage would but give way to customers.

    Enter LYSIMACHUS

LYSIMACHUS

    How now! How a dozen of virginities?

Bawd

    Now, the gods to-bless your honour!

BOULT

    I am glad to see your honour in good health.

LYSIMACHUS

    You may so; 'tis the better for you that your
    resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
    wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal
    withal, and defy the surgeon?

Bawd

    We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never
    came her like in Mytilene.

LYSIMACHUS

    If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.

Bawd

    Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.

LYSIMACHUS

    Well, call forth, call forth.

BOULT

    For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall
    see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--

LYSIMACHUS

    What, prithee?

BOULT

    O, sir, I can be modest.

LYSIMACHUS

    That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it
    gives a good report to a number to be chaste.

    Exit BOULT

Bawd

    Here comes that which grows to the stalk; never
    plucked yet, I can assure you.

    Re-enter BOULT with MARINA
    Is she not a fair creature?

LYSIMACHUS

    'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.
    Well, there's for you: leave us.

Bawd

    I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and
    I'll have done presently.

LYSIMACHUS

    I beseech you, do.

Bawd

    [To MARINA] First, I would have you note, this is
    an honourable man.

MARINA

    I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.

Bawd

    Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man
    whom I am bound to.

MARINA

    If he govern the country, you are bound to him
    indeed; but how honourable he is in that, I know not.

Bawd

    Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will
    you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.

MARINA

    What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.

LYSIMACHUS

    Ha' you done?

Bawd

    My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some
    pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will
    leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.

    Exeunt Bawd, Pandar, and BOULT

LYSIMACHUS

    Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?

MARINA

    What trade, sir?

LYSIMACHUS

    Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.

MARINA

    I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.

LYSIMACHUS

    How long have you been of this profession?

MARINA

    E'er since I can remember.

LYSIMACHUS

    Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at
    five or at seven?

MARINA

    Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.

LYSIMACHUS

    Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a
    creature of sale.

MARINA

    Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,
    and will come into 't? I hear say you are of
    honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.

LYSIMACHUS

    Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?

MARINA

    Who is my principal?

LYSIMACHUS

    Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots
    of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something
    of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious
    wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my
    authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly
    upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place:
    come, come.

MARINA

    If you were born to honour, show it now;
    If put upon you, make the judgment good
    That thought you worthy of it.

LYSIMACHUS

    How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.

MARINA

    For me,
    That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune
    Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,
    Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,
    O, that the gods
    Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,
    Though they did change me to the meanest bird
    That flies i' the purer air!

LYSIMACHUS

    I did not think
    Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.
    Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,
    Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee:
    Persever in that clear way thou goest,
    And the gods strengthen thee!

MARINA

    The good gods preserve you!

LYSIMACHUS

    For me, be you thoughten
    That I came with no ill intent; for to me
    The very doors and windows savour vilely.
    Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and
    I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.
    Hold, here's more gold for thee.
    A curse upon him, die he like a thief,
    That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost
    Hear from me, it shall be for thy good.

    Re-enter BOULT

BOULT

    I beseech your honour, one piece for me.

LYSIMACHUS

    Avaunt, thou damned door-keeper!
    Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,
    Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!

    Exit

BOULT

    How's this? We must take another course with you.
    If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a
    breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,
    shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like
    a spaniel. Come your ways.

MARINA

    Whither would you have me?

BOULT

    I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common
    hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll
    have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.

    Re-enter Bawd

Bawd

    How now! what's the matter?

BOULT

    Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy
    words to the Lord Lysimachus.

Bawd

    O abominable!

BOULT

    She makes our profession as it were to stink afore
    the face of the gods.

Bawd

    Marry, hang her up for ever!

BOULT

    The nobleman would have dealt with her like a
    nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a
    snowball; saying his prayers too.

Bawd

    Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:
    crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.

BOULT

    An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she
    is, she shall be ploughed.

MARINA

    Hark, hark, you gods!

Bawd

    She conjures: away with her! Would she had never
    come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's born
    to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?
    Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!

    Exit

BOULT

    Come, mistress; come your ways with me.

MARINA

    Whither wilt thou have me?

BOULT

    To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.

MARINA

    Prithee, tell me one thing first.

BOULT

    Come now, your one thing.

MARINA

    What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?

BOULT

    Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.

MARINA

    Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
    Since they do better thee in their command.
    Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend
    Of hell would not in reputation change:
    Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
    Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;
    To the choleric fisting of every rogue
    Thy ear is liable; thy food is such
    As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.

BOULT

    What would you have me do? go to the wars, would
    you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss
    of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to
    buy him a wooden one?

MARINA

    Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty
    OLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth;
    Serve by indenture to the common hangman:
    Any of these ways are yet better than this;
    For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,
    Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods
    Would safely deliver me from this place!
    Here, here's gold for thee.
    If that thy master would gain by thee,
    Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
    With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:
    And I will undertake all these to teach.
    I doubt not but this populous city will
    Yield many scholars.

BOULT

    But can you teach all this you speak of?

MARINA

    Prove that I cannot, take me home again,
    And prostitute me to the basest groom
    That doth frequent your house.

BOULT

    Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can
    place thee, I will.

MARINA

    But amongst honest women.

BOULT

    'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.
    But since my master and mistress have bought you,
    there's no going but by their consent: therefore I
    will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I
    doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.
    Come, I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.

    Exeunt

ACT V

    Enter GOWER

GOWER

    Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances
    Into an honest house, our story says.
    She sings like one immortal, and she dances
    As goddess-like to her admired lays;
    Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes
    Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
    That even her art sisters the natural roses;
    Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:
    That pupils lacks she none of noble race,
    Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain
    She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;
    And to her father turn our thoughts again,
    Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;
    Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived
    Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast
    Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived
    God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence
    Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,
    His banners sable, trimm'd with rich expense;
    And to him in his barge with fervor hies.
    In your supposing once more put your sight
    Of heavy Pericles; think this his bark:
    Where what is done in action, more, if might,
    Shall be discover'd; please you, sit and hark.

    Exit

SCENE I. On board PERICLES' ship, off Mytilene. A close

    pavilion on deck, with a curtain before it; PERICLES
    within it, reclined on a couch. A barge lying
    beside the Tyrian vessel.

    Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian vessel, the other to the barge; to them HELICANUS

Tyrian Sailor

    [To the Sailor of Mytilene] Where is lord Helicanus?
    he can resolve you.
    O, here he is.
    Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,
    And in it is Lysimachus the governor,
    Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?

HELICANUS

    That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.

Tyrian Sailor

    Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls.

    Enter two or three Gentlemen

First Gentleman

    Doth your lordship call?

HELICANUS

    Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;
    I pray ye, greet them fairly.

    The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go on board the barge

    Enter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords; with the Gentlemen and the two Sailors

Tyrian Sailor

    Sir,
    This is the man that can, in aught you would,
    Resolve you.

LYSIMACHUS

    Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!

HELICANUS

    And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,
    And die as I would do.

LYSIMACHUS

    You wish me well.
    Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,
    Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,
    I made to it, to know of whence you are.

HELICANUS

    First, what is your place?

LYSIMACHUS

    I am the governor of this place you lie before.

HELICANUS

    Sir,
    Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;
    A man who for this three months hath not spoken
    To any one, nor taken sustenance
    But to prorogue his grief.

LYSIMACHUS

    Upon what ground is his distemperature?

HELICANUS

    'Twould be too tedious to repeat;
    But the main grief springs from the loss
    Of a beloved daughter and a wife.

LYSIMACHUS

    May we not see him?

HELICANUS

    You may;
    But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.

LYSIMACHUS

    Yet let me obtain my wish.

HELICANUS

    Behold him.

    PERICLES discovered
    This was a goodly person,
    Till the disaster that, one mortal night,
    Drove him to this.

LYSIMACHUS

    Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!
    Hail, royal sir!

HELICANUS

    It is in vain; he will not speak to you.

First Lord

    Sir,
    We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,
    Would win some words of him.

LYSIMACHUS

    'Tis well bethought.
    She questionless with her sweet harmony
    And other chosen attractions, would allure,
    And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,
    Which now are midway stopp'd:
    She is all happy as the fairest of all,
    And, with her fellow maids is now upon
    The leafy shelter that abuts against
    The island's side.

    Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of LYSIMACHUS

HELICANUS

    Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit
    That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness
    We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you
    That for our gold we may provision have,
    Wherein we are not destitute for want,
    But weary for the staleness.

LYSIMACHUS

    O, sir, a courtesy
    Which if we should deny, the most just gods
    For every graff would send a caterpillar,
    And so afflict our province. Yet once more
    Let me entreat to know at large the cause
    Of your king's sorrow.

HELICANUS

    Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:
    But, see, I am prevented.

    Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a young Lady

LYSIMACHUS

    O, here is
    The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!
    Is't not a goodly presence?

HELICANUS

    She's a gallant lady.

LYSIMACHUS

    She's such a one, that, were I well assured
    Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,
    I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.
    Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty
    Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:
    If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
    Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,
    Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
    As thy desires can wish.

MARINA

    Sir, I will use
    My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided
    That none but I and my companion maid
    Be suffer'd to come near him.

LYSIMACHUS

    Come, let us leave her;
    And the gods make her prosperous!

    MARINA sings

LYSIMACHUS

    Mark'd he your music?

MARINA

    No, nor look'd on us.

LYSIMACHUS

    See, she will speak to him.

MARINA

    Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.

PERICLES

    Hum, ha!

MARINA

    I am a maid,
    My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,
    But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,
    My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief
    Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.
    Though wayward fortune did malign my state,
    My derivation was from ancestors
    Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:
    But time hath rooted out my parentage,
    And to the world and awkward casualties
    Bound me in servitude.

    Aside
    I will desist;
    But there is something glows upon my cheek,
    And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'

PERICLES

    My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--
    To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?

MARINA

    I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,
    You would not do me violence.

PERICLES

    I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.
    You are like something that--What country-woman?
    Here of these shores?

MARINA

    No, nor of any shores:
    Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
    No other than I appear.

PERICLES

    I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
    My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
    My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
    Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;
    As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like
    And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;
    Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
    The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?

MARINA

    Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
    You may discern the place.

PERICLES

    Where were you bred?
    And how achieved you these endowments, which
    You make more rich to owe?

MARINA

    If I should tell my history, it would seem
    Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.

PERICLES

    Prithee, speak:
    Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st
    Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace
    For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will
    believe thee,
    And make my senses credit thy relation
    To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st
    Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
    Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
    Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest
    From good descending?

MARINA

    So indeed I did.

PERICLES

    Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st
    Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,
    And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
    If both were open'd.

MARINA

    Some such thing
    I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
    Did warrant me was likely.

PERICLES

    Tell thy story;
    If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
    Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
    Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
    Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling
    Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
    How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?
    Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.

MARINA

    My name is Marina.

PERICLES

    O, I am mock'd,
    And thou by some incensed god sent hither
    To make the world to laugh at me.

MARINA

    Patience, good sir,
    Or here I'll cease.

PERICLES

    Nay, I'll be patient.
    Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,
    To call thyself Marina.

MARINA

    The name
    Was given me by one that had some power,
    My father, and a king.

PERICLES

    How! a king's daughter?
    And call'd Marina?

MARINA

    You said you would believe me;
    But, not to be a troubler of your peace,
    I will end here.

PERICLES

    But are you flesh and blood?
    Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
    Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?
    And wherefore call'd Marina?

MARINA

    Call'd Marina
    For I was born at sea.

PERICLES

    At sea! what mother?

MARINA

    My mother was the daughter of a king;
    Who died the minute I was born,
    As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
    Deliver'd weeping.

PERICLES

    O, stop there a little!

    Aside
    This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
    Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:
    My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?
    I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,
    And never interrupt you.

MARINA

    You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.

PERICLES

    I will believe you by the syllable
    Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:
    How came you in these parts? where were you bred?

MARINA

    The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;
    Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
    Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd
    A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,
    A crew of pirates came and rescued me;
    Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,
    Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?
    It may be,
    You think me an impostor: no, good faith;
    I am the daughter to King Pericles,
    If good King Pericles be.

PERICLES

    Ho, Helicanus!

HELICANUS

    Calls my lord?

PERICLES

    Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,
    Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,
    What this maid is, or what is like to be,
    That thus hath made me weep?

HELICANUS

    I know not; but
    Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene
    Speaks nobly of her.

LYSIMACHUS

    She would never tell
    Her parentage; being demanded that,
    She would sit still and weep.

PERICLES

    O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;
    Give me a gash, put me to present pain;
    Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
    O'erbear the shores of my mortality,
    And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,
    Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;
    Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,
    And found at sea again! O Helicanus,
    Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud
    As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.
    What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,
    For truth can never be confirm'd enough,
    Though doubts did ever sleep.

MARINA

    First, sir, I pray,
    What is your title?

PERICLES

    I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now
    My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said
    Thou hast been godlike perfect,
    The heir of kingdoms and another like
    To Pericles thy father.

MARINA

    Is it no more to be your daughter than
    To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
    Thaisa was my mother, who did end
    The minute I began.

PERICLES

    Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.
    Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;
    She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,
    By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;
    When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge
    She is thy very princess. Who is this?

HELICANUS

    Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,
    Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
    Did come to see you.

PERICLES

    I embrace you.
    Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.
    O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?
    Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him
    O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,
    How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?

HELICANUS

    My lord, I hear none.

PERICLES

    None!
    The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.

LYSIMACHUS

    It is not good to cross him; give him way.

PERICLES

    Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?

LYSIMACHUS

    My lord, I hear.

    Music

PERICLES

    Most heavenly music!
    It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber
    Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.

    Sleeps

LYSIMACHUS

    A pillow for his head:
    So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
    If this but answer to my just belief,
    I'll well remember you.

    Exeunt all but PERICLES

    DIANA appears to PERICLES as in a vision

DIANA

    My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,
    And do upon mine altar sacrifice.
    There, when my maiden priests are met together,
    Before the people all,
    Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
    To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call
    And give them repetition to the life.
    Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;
    Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!
    Awake, and tell thy dream.

    Disappears

PERICLES

    Celestial Dian, goddess argentine,
    I will obey thee. Helicanus!

    Re-enter HELICANUS, LYSIMACHUS, and MARINA

HELICANUS

    Sir?

PERICLES

    My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
    The inhospitable Cleon; but I am
    For other service first: toward Ephesus
    Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.

    To LYSIMACHUS
    Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
    And give you gold for such provision
    As our intents will need?

LYSIMACHUS

    Sir,
    With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,
    I have another suit.

PERICLES

    You shall prevail,
    Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems
    You have been noble towards her.

LYSIMACHUS

    Sir, lend me your arm.

PERICLES

    Come, my Marina.

    Exeunt
    SCENE II:

    Enter GOWER, before the temple of DIANA at Ephesus

GOWER

    Now our sands are almost run;
    More a little, and then dumb.
    This, my last boon, give me,
    For such kindness must relieve me,
    That you aptly will suppose
    What pageantry, what feats, what shows,
    What minstrelsy, and pretty din,
    The regent made in Mytilene
    To greet the king. So he thrived,
    That he is promised to be wived
    To fair Marina; but in no wise
    Till he had done his sacrifice,
    As Dian bade: whereto being bound,
    The interim, pray you, all confound.
    In feather'd briefness sails are fill'd,
    And wishes fall out as they're will'd.
    At Ephesus, the temple see,
    Our king and all his company.
    That he can hither come so soon,
    Is by your fancy's thankful doom.

    Exit

SCENE III. The temple of Diana at Ephesus; THAISA standing

    near the altar, as high priestess; a number of
    Virgins on each side; CERIMON and other Inhabitants
    of Ephesus attending.

    Enter PERICLES, with his train; LYSIMACHUS, HELICANUS, MARINA, and a Lady

PERICLES

    Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,
    I here confess myself the king of Tyre;
    Who, frighted from my country, did wed
    At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.
    At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
    A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,
    Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus
    Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years
    He sought to murder: but her better stars
    Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore
    Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,
    Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
    Made known herself my daughter.

THAISA

    Voice and favour!
    You are, you are--O royal Pericles!

    Faints

PERICLES

    What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!

CERIMON

    Noble sir,
    If you have told Diana's altar true,
    This is your wife.

PERICLES

    Reverend appearer, no;
    I threw her overboard with these very arms.

CERIMON

    Upon this coast, I warrant you.

PERICLES

    'Tis most certain.

CERIMON

    Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.
    Early in blustering morn this lady was
    Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,
    Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her
    Here in Diana's temple.

PERICLES

    May we see them?

CERIMON

    Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,
    Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.

THAISA

    O, let me look!
    If he be none of mine, my sanctity
    Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,
    But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,
    Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,
    Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,
    A birth, and death?

PERICLES

    The voice of dead Thaisa!

THAISA

    That Thaisa am I, supposed dead
    And drown'd.

PERICLES

    Immortal Dian!

THAISA

    Now I know you better.
    When we with tears parted Pentapolis,
    The king my father gave you such a ring.

    Shows a ring

PERICLES

    This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness
    Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,
    That on the touching of her lips I may
    Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried
    A second time within these arms.

MARINA

    My heart
    Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.

    Kneels to THAISA

PERICLES

    Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;
    Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina
    For she was yielded there.

THAISA

    Blest, and mine own!

HELICANUS

    Hail, madam, and my queen!

THAISA

    I know you not.

PERICLES

    You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,
    I left behind an ancient substitute:
    Can you remember what I call'd the man?
    I have named him oft.

THAISA

    'Twas Helicanus then.

PERICLES

    Still confirmation:
    Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.
    Now do I long to hear how you were found;
    How possibly preserved; and who to thank,
    Besides the gods, for this great miracle.

THAISA

    Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,
    Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can
    From first to last resolve you.

PERICLES

    Reverend sir,
    The gods can have no mortal officer
    More like a god than you. Will you deliver
    How this dead queen re-lives?

CERIMON

    I will, my lord.
    Beseech you, first go with me to my house,
    Where shall be shown you all was found with her;
    How she came placed here in the temple;
    No needful thing omitted.

PERICLES

    Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I
    Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,
    This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,
    Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,
    This ornament
    Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
    And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,
    To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.

THAISA

    Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,
    My father's dead.

PERICLES

    Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,
    We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves
    Will in that kingdom spend our following days:
    Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
    Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay
    To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.

    Exeunt

    Enter GOWER

GOWER

    In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
    Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
    In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
    Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
    Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
    Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:
    In Helicanus may you well descry
    A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:
    In reverend Cerimon there well appears
    The worth that learned charity aye wears:
    For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
    Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name
    Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
    That him and his they in his palace burn;
    The gods for murder seemed so content
    To punish them; although not done, but meant.
    So, on your patience evermore attending,
    New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.

    Exit


The Taming of the Shrew

SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.

    Enter Hostess and SLY

SLY

    I'll pheeze you, in faith.

Hostess

    A pair of stocks, you rogue!

SLY

    Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
    the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
    Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!

Hostess

    You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?

SLY

    No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
    bed, and warm thee.

Hostess

    I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
    third--borough.

    Exit

SLY

    Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
    by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
    and kindly.

    Falls asleep

    Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train

Lord

    Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
    Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
    And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
    Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
    At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
    I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.

First Huntsman

    Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
    He cried upon it at the merest loss
    And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
    Trust me, I take him for the better dog.

Lord

    Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
    I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
    But sup them well and look unto them all:
    To-morrow I intend to hunt again.

First Huntsman

    I will, my lord.

Lord

    What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?

Second Huntsman

    He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
    This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.

Lord

    O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
    Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
    Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
    What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
    Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
    A most delicious banquet by his bed,
    And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
    Would not the beggar then forget himself?

First Huntsman

    Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.

Second Huntsman

    It would seem strange unto him when he waked.

Lord

    Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
    Then take him up and manage well the jest:
    Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
    And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
    Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
    And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
    Procure me music ready when he wakes,
    To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
    And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
    And with a low submissive reverence
    Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
    Let one attend him with a silver basin
    Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
    Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
    And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
    Some one be ready with a costly suit
    And ask him what apparel he will wear;
    Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
    And that his lady mourns at his disease:
    Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
    And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
    For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
    This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
    It will be pastime passing excellent,
    If it be husbanded with modesty.

First Huntsman

    My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
    As he shall think by our true diligence
    He is no less than what we say he is.

Lord

    Take him up gently and to bed with him;
    And each one to his office when he wakes.

    Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds
    Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:

    Exit Servingman
    Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
    Travelling some journey, to repose him here.

    Re-enter Servingman
    How now! who is it?

Servant

    An't please your honour, players
    That offer service to your lordship.

Lord

    Bid them come near.

    Enter Players
    Now, fellows, you are welcome.

Players

    We thank your honour.

Lord

    Do you intend to stay with me tonight?

A Player

    So please your lordship to accept our duty.

Lord

    With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
    Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
    'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
    I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
    Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.

A Player

    I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.

Lord

    'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
    Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
    The rather for I have some sport in hand
    Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
    There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
    But I am doubtful of your modesties;
    Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
    For yet his honour never heard a play--
    You break into some merry passion
    And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
    If you should smile he grows impatient.

A Player

    Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
    Were he the veriest antic in the world.

Lord

    Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
    And give them friendly welcome every one:
    Let them want nothing that my house affords.

    Exit one with the Players
    Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
    And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
    That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
    And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
    Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
    He bear himself with honourable action,
    Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
    Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
    Such duty to the drunkard let him do
    With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
    And say 'What is't your honour will command,
    Wherein your lady and your humble wife
    May show her duty and make known her love?'
    And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
    And with declining head into his bosom,
    Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
    To see her noble lord restored to health,
    Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
    No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
    And if the boy have not a woman's gift
    To rain a shower of commanded tears,
    An onion will do well for such a shift,
    Which in a napkin being close convey'd
    Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
    See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
    Anon I'll give thee more instructions.

    Exit a Servingman
    I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
    Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
    I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
    And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
    When they do homage to this simple peasant.
    I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
    May well abate the over-merry spleen
    Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A bedchamber in the Lord's house.

    Enter aloft SLY, with Attendants; some with apparel, others with basin and ewer and appurtenances; and Lord

SLY

    For God's sake, a pot of small ale.

First Servant

    Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?

Second Servant

    Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?

Third Servant

    What raiment will your honour wear to-day?

SLY

    I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
    'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if
    you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
    beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I
    have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
    than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,
    sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
    toes look through the over-leather.

Lord

    Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
    O, that a mighty man of such descent,
    Of such possessions and so high esteem,
    Should be infused with so foul a spirit!

SLY

    What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher
    Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a
    pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a
    bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?
    Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if
    she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence
    on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the
    lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not
    bestraught: here's--

Third Servant

    O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!

Second Servant

    O, this is it that makes your servants droop!

Lord

    Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
    As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
    O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
    Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
    And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
    Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
    Each in his office ready at thy beck.
    Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,

    Music
    And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
    Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
    Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
    On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
    Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:
    Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
    Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
    Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
    Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
    Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
    And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.

First Servant

    Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
    As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.

Second Servant

    Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
    Adonis painted by a running brook,
    And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
    Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
    Even as the waving sedges play with wind.

Lord

    We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
    And how she was beguiled and surprised,
    As lively painted as the deed was done.

Third Servant

    Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
    Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
    And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
    So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.

Lord

    Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:
    Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
    Than any woman in this waning age.

First Servant

    And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
    Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
    She was the fairest creature in the world;
    And yet she is inferior to none.

SLY

    Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
    Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
    I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
    I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
    Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
    And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
    Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
    And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.

Second Servant

    Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
    O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
    O, that once more you knew but what you are!
    These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
    Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.

SLY

    These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
    But did I never speak of all that time?

First Servant

    O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
    For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
    Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
    And rail upon the hostess of the house;
    And say you would present her at the leet,
    Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
    Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.

SLY

    Ay, the woman's maid of the house.

Third Servant

    Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
    Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
    As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
    And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
    And twenty more such names and men as these
    Which never were nor no man ever saw.

SLY

    Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!

ALL

    Amen.

SLY

    I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.

    How fares my noble lord?

SLY

    Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.
    Where is my wife?

Page

    Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?

SLY

    Are you my wife and will not call me husband?
    My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.

Page

    My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
    I am your wife in all obedience.

SLY

    I know it well. What must I call her?

Lord

    Madam.

SLY

    Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?

Lord

    'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords
    call ladies.

SLY

    Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
    And slept above some fifteen year or more.

Page

    Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
    Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.

SLY

    'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
    Madam, undress you and come now to bed.

Page

    Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
    To pardon me yet for a night or two,
    Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
    For your physicians have expressly charged,
    In peril to incur your former malady,
    That I should yet absent me from your bed:
    I hope this reason stands for my excuse.

SLY

    Ay, it stands so that I may hardly
    tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
    my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in
    despite of the flesh and the blood.

Messenger

    Your honour's players, heating your amendment,
    Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
    For so your doctors hold it very meet,
    Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
    And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
    Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
    And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
    Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.

SLY

    Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a
    comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?

Page

    No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.

SLY

    What, household stuff?

Page

    It is a kind of history.

SLY

    Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side
    and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.

ACT I
SCENE I. Padua. A public place.

    Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO

LUCENTIO

    Tranio, since for the great desire I had
    To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
    I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
    The pleasant garden of great Italy;
    And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
    With his good will and thy good company,
    My trusty servant, well approved in all,
    Here let us breathe and haply institute
    A course of learning and ingenious studies.
    Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
    Gave me my being and my father first,
    A merchant of great traffic through the world,
    Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
    Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
    It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
    To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
    And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
    Virtue and that part of philosophy
    Will I apply that treats of happiness
    By virtue specially to be achieved.
    Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
    And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
    A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
    And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.

TRANIO

    Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
    I am in all affected as yourself;
    Glad that you thus continue your resolve
    To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
    Only, good master, while we do admire
    This virtue and this moral discipline,
    Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
    Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
    As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
    Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
    And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
    Music and poesy use to quicken you;
    The mathematics and the metaphysics,
    Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
    No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
    In brief, sir, study what you most affect.

LUCENTIO

    Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
    If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
    We could at once put us in readiness,
    And take a lodging fit to entertain
    Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
    But stay a while: what company is this?

TRANIO

    Master, some show to welcome us to town.

    Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by

BAPTISTA

    Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
    For how I firmly am resolved you know;
    That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
    Before I have a husband for the elder:
    If either of you both love Katharina,
    Because I know you well and love you well,
    Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.

GREMIO

    [Aside] To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.
    There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?

KATHARINA

    I pray you, sir, is it your will
    To make a stale of me amongst these mates?

HORTENSIO

    Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
    Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.

KATHARINA

    I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
    I wis it is not half way to her heart;
    But if it were, doubt not her care should be
    To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
    And paint your face and use you like a fool.

HORTENSIA

    From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!

GREMIO

    And me too, good Lord!

TRANIO

    Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:
    That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.

LUCENTIO

    But in the other's silence do I see
    Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.
    Peace, Tranio!

TRANIO

    Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.

BAPTISTA

    Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
    What I have said, Bianca, get you in:
    And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
    For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.

KATHARINA

    A pretty peat! it is best
    Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.

BIANCA

    Sister, content you in my discontent.
    Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
    My books and instruments shall be my company,
    On them to took and practise by myself.

LUCENTIO

    Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.

HORTENSIO

    Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
    Sorry am I that our good will effects
    Bianca's grief.

GREMIO

    Why will you mew her up,
    Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
    And make her bear the penance of her tongue?

BAPTISTA

    Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:
    Go in, Bianca:

    Exit BIANCA
    And for I know she taketh most delight
    In music, instruments and poetry,
    Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
    Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
    Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
    Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
    I will be very kind, and liberal
    To mine own children in good bringing up:
    And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
    For I have more to commune with Bianca.

    Exit

KATHARINA

    Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
    shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I
    knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?

    Exit

GREMIO

    You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
    good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not
    so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
    together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
    both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
    sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
    man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
    wish him to her father.

HORTENSIO

    So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
    Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
    parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,
    that we may yet again have access to our fair
    mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
    labour and effect one thing specially.

GREMIO

    What's that, I pray?

HORTENSIO

    Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.

GREMIO

    A husband! a devil.

HORTENSIO

    I say, a husband.

GREMIO

    I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though
    her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool
    to be married to hell?

HORTENSIO

    Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine
    to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
    fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,
    would take her with all faults, and money enough.

GREMIO

    I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
    this condition, to be whipped at the high cross
    every morning.

HORTENSIO

    Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
    apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
    friends, it shall be so far forth friendly
    maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
    to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
    and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
    be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
    How say you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO

    I am agreed; and would I had given him the best
    horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
    thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the
    house of her! Come on.

    Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO

TRANIO

    I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
    That love should of a sudden take such hold?

LUCENTIO

    O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
    I never thought it possible or likely;
    But see, while idly I stood looking on,
    I found the effect of love in idleness:
    And now in plainness do confess to thee,
    That art to me as secret and as dear
    As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
    Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
    If I achieve not this young modest girl.
    Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
    Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.

TRANIO

    Master, it is no time to chide you now;
    Affection is not rated from the heart:
    If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
    'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'

LUCENTIO

    Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
    The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.

TRANIO

    Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
    Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.

LUCENTIO

    O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
    Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
    That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
    When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.

TRANIO

    Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
    Began to scold and raise up such a storm
    That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?

LUCENTIO

    Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
    And with her breath she did perfume the air:
    Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.

TRANIO

    Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
    I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
    Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
    Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
    That till the father rid his hands of her,
    Master, your love must live a maid at home;
    And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
    Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.

LUCENTIO

    Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
    But art thou not advised, he took some care
    To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?

TRANIO

    Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.

LUCENTIO

    I have it, Tranio.

TRANIO

    Master, for my hand,
    Both our inventions meet and jump in one.

LUCENTIO

    Tell me thine first.

TRANIO

    You will be schoolmaster
    And undertake the teaching of the maid:
    That's your device.

LUCENTIO

    It is: may it be done?

TRANIO

    Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
    And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
    Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
    Visit his countrymen and banquet them?

LUCENTIO

    Basta; content thee, for I have it full.
    We have not yet been seen in any house,
    Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
    For man or master; then it follows thus;
    Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
    Keep house and port and servants as I should:
    I will some other be, some Florentine,
    Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
    'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
    Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
    When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
    But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.

TRANIO

    So had you need.
    In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
    And I am tied to be obedient;
    For so your father charged me at our parting,
    'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
    Although I think 'twas in another sense;
    I am content to be Lucentio,
    Because so well I love Lucentio.

LUCENTIO

    Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:
    And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
    Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
    Here comes the rogue.

    Enter BIONDELLO
    Sirrah, where have you been?

BIONDELLO

    Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
    Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
    you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?

LUCENTIO

    Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
    And therefore frame your manners to the time.
    Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
    Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
    And I for my escape have put on his;
    For in a quarrel since I came ashore
    I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
    Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
    While I make way from hence to save my life:
    You understand me?

BIONDELLO

    I, sir! ne'er a whit.

LUCENTIO

    And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
    Tranio is changed into Lucentio.

BIONDELLO

    The better for him: would I were so too!

TRANIO

    So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
    That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
    But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
    You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
    When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
    But in all places else your master Lucentio.

LUCENTIO

    Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that
    thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if
    thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good
    and weighty.

    Exeunt

    The presenters above speak

First Servant

    My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.

SLY

    Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:
    comes there any more of it?

Page

    My lord, 'tis but begun.

SLY

    'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:
    would 'twere done!

    They sit and mark

SCENE II. Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house.

    Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO

PETRUCHIO

    Verona, for a while I take my leave,
    To see my friends in Padua, but of all
    My best beloved and approved friend,
    Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
    Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.

GRUMIO

    Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
    rebused your worship?

PETRUCHIO

    Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.

GRUMIO

    Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
    I should knock you here, sir?

PETRUCHIO

    Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
    And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.

GRUMIO

    My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
    you first,
    And then I know after who comes by the worst.

PETRUCHIO

    Will it not be?
    Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
    I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.

    He wrings him by the ears

GRUMIO

    Help, masters, help! my master is mad.

PETRUCHIO

    Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!

    Enter HORTENSIO

HORTENSIO

    How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
    and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?

PETRUCHIO

    Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
    'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.

HORTENSIO

    'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
    mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
    this quarrel.

GRUMIO

    Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
    if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
    service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
    him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
    use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
    two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
    well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.

PETRUCHIO

    A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
    I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
    And could not get him for my heart to do it.

GRUMIO

    Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
    words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
    knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
    now with, 'knocking at the gate'?

PETRUCHIO

    Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.

HORTENSIO

    Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
    Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
    Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
    And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
    Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?

PETRUCHIO

    Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
    To seek their fortunes farther than at home
    Where small experience grows. But in a few,
    Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
    Antonio, my father, is deceased;
    And I have thrust myself into this maze,
    Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
    Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
    And so am come abroad to see the world.

HORTENSIO

    Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
    And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
    Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
    And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
    And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
    And I'll not wish thee to her.

PETRUCHIO

    Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
    Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
    One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
    As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
    Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
    As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
    As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
    She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
    Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
    As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
    I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
    If wealthily, then happily in Padua.

GRUMIO

    Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
    mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
    a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
    a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases
    as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
    so money comes withal.

HORTENSIO

    Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
    I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
    I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
    With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
    Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
    Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
    Is that she is intolerable curst
    And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
    That, were my state far worser than it is,
    I would not wed her for a mine of gold.

PETRUCHIO

    Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
    Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
    For I will board her, though she chide as loud
    As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.

HORTENSIO

    Her father is Baptista Minola,
    An affable and courteous gentleman:
    Her name is Katharina Minola,
    Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.

PETRUCHIO

    I know her father, though I know not her;
    And he knew my deceased father well.
    I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
    And therefore let me be thus bold with you
    To give you over at this first encounter,
    Unless you will accompany me thither.

GRUMIO

    I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
    O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
    would think scolding would do little good upon him:
    she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
    why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in
    his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
    stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
    her face and so disfigure her with it that she
    shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
    You know him not, sir.

HORTENSIO

    Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
    For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
    He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
    His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
    And her withholds from me and other more,
    Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
    Supposing it a thing impossible,
    For those defects I have before rehearsed,
    That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
    Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
    That none shall have access unto Bianca
    Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.

GRUMIO

    Katharina the curst!
    A title for a maid of all titles the worst.

HORTENSIO

    Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
    And offer me disguised in sober robes
    To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
    Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
    That so I may, by this device, at least
    Have leave and leisure to make love to her
    And unsuspected court her by herself.

GRUMIO

    Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,
    how the young folks lay their heads together!

    Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised
    Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?

HORTENSIO

    Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
    Petruchio, stand by a while.

GRUMIO

    A proper stripling and an amorous!

GREMIO

    O, very well; I have perused the note.
    Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:
    All books of love, see that at any hand;
    And see you read no other lectures to her:
    You understand me: over and beside
    Signior Baptista's liberality,
    I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
    And let me have them very well perfumed
    For she is sweeter than perfume itself
    To whom they go to. What will you read to her?

LUCENTIO

    Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
    As for my patron, stand you so assured,
    As firmly as yourself were still in place:
    Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
    Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.

GREMIO

    O this learning, what a thing it is!

GRUMIO

    O this woodcock, what an ass it is!

PETRUCHIO

    Peace, sirrah!

HORTENSIO

    Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.

GREMIO

    And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
    Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
    I promised to inquire carefully
    About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
    And by good fortune I have lighted well
    On this young man, for learning and behavior
    Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
    And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.

HORTENSIO

    'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
    Hath promised me to help me to another,
    A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
    So shall I no whit be behind in duty
    To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.

GREMIO

    Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.

GRUMIO

    And that his bags shall prove.

HORTENSIO

    Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
    Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
    I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
    Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
    Upon agreement from us to his liking,
    Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,
    Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.

GREMIO

    So said, so done, is well.
    Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?

PETRUCHIO

    I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
    If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.

GREMIO

    No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?

PETRUCHIO

    Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
    My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
    And I do hope good days and long to see.

GREMIO

    O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
    But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
    You shall have me assisting you in all.
    But will you woo this wild-cat?

PETRUCHIO

    Will I live?

GRUMIO

    Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.

PETRUCHIO

    Why came I hither but to that intent?
    Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
    Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
    Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
    Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
    Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
    And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
    Have I not in a pitched battle heard
    Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
    And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
    That gives not half so great a blow to hear
    As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
    Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.

GRUMIO

    For he fears none.

GREMIO

    Hortensio, hark:
    This gentleman is happily arrived,
    My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.

HORTENSIO

    I promised we would be contributors
    And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.

GREMIO

    And so we will, provided that he win her.

GRUMIO

    I would I were as sure of a good dinner.

    Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO

TRANIO

    Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
    Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
    To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?

BIONDELLO

    He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?

TRANIO

    Even he, Biondello.

GREMIO

    Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--

TRANIO

    Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?

PETRUCHIO

    Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.

TRANIO

    I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.

LUCENTIO

    Well begun, Tranio.

HORTENSIO

    Sir, a word ere you go;
    Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?

TRANIO

    And if I be, sir, is it any offence?

GREMIO

    No; if without more words you will get you hence.

TRANIO

    Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
    For me as for you?

GREMIO

    But so is not she.

TRANIO

    For what reason, I beseech you?

GREMIO

    For this reason, if you'll know,
    That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.

HORTENSIO

    That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.

TRANIO

    Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
    Do me this right; hear me with patience.
    Baptista is a noble gentleman,
    To whom my father is not all unknown;
    And were his daughter fairer than she is,
    She may more suitors have and me for one.
    Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
    Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
    And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
    Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.

GREMIO

    What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.

LUCENTIO

    Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.

PETRUCHIO

    Hortensio, to what end are all these words?

HORTENSIO

    Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
    Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?

TRANIO

    No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
    The one as famous for a scolding tongue
    As is the other for beauteous modesty.

PETRUCHIO

    Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.

GREMIO

    Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
    And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.

PETRUCHIO

    Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
    The younges t daughter whom you hearken for
    Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
    And will not promise her to any man
    Until the elder sister first be wed:
    The younger then is free and not before.

TRANIO

    If it be so, sir, that you are the man
    Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
    And if you break the ice and do this feat,
    Achieve the elder, set the younger free
    For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
    Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.

HORTENSIO

    Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
    And since you do profess to be a suitor,
    You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
    To whom we all rest generally beholding.

TRANIO

    Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
    Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
    And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
    And do as adversaries do in law,
    Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.

GRUMIO BIONDELLO

    O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.

HORTENSIO

    The motion's good indeed and be it so,
    Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.

    Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA

BIANCA

    Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
    To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
    That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
    Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
    Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
    Or what you will command me will I do,
    So well I know my duty to my elders.

KATHARINA

    Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
    Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.

BIANCA

    Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
    I never yet beheld that special face
    Which I could fancy more than any other.

KATHARINA

    Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?

BIANCA

    If you affect him, sister, here I swear
    I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
    him.

KATHARINA

    O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
    You will have Gremio to keep you fair.

BIANCA

    Is it for him you do envy me so?
    Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
    You have but jested with me all this while:
    I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.

KATHARINA

    If that be jest, then all the rest was so.

    Strikes her

    Enter BAPTISTA

BAPTISTA

    Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
    Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
    Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
    For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
    Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
    When did she cross thee with a bitter word?

KATHARINA

    Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.

    Flies after BIANCA

BAPTISTA

    What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.

    Exit BIANCA

KATHARINA

    What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
    She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
    I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
    And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
    Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
    Till I can find occasion of revenge.

    Exit

BAPTISTA

    Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
    But who comes here?

    Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man; PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO, with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books

GREMIO

    Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.

BAPTISTA

    Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
    God save you, gentlemen!

PETRUCHIO

    And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
    Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?

BAPTISTA

    I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.

GREMIO

    You are too blunt: go to it orderly.

PETRUCHIO

    You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
    I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
    That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
    Her affability and bashful modesty,
    Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
    Am bold to show myself a forward guest
    Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
    Of that report which I so oft have heard.
    And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
    I do present you with a man of mine,

    Presenting HORTENSIO
    Cunning in music and the mathematics,
    To instruct her fully in those sciences,
    Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
    Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
    His name is Licio, born in Mantua.

BAPTISTA

    You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
    But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
    She is not for your turn, the more my grief.

PETRUCHIO

    I see you do not mean to part with her,
    Or else you like not of my company.

BAPTISTA

    Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
    Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?

PETRUCHIO

    Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
    A man well known throughout all Italy.

BAPTISTA

    I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.

GREMIO

    Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
    Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
    Baccare! you are marvellous forward.

PETRUCHIO

    O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.

GREMIO

    I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
    wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
    sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
    that have been more kindly beholding to you than
    any, freely give unto you this young scholar,

    Presenting LUCENTIO
    that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning
    in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
    in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
    accept his service.

BAPTISTA

    A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
    Welcome, good Cambio.

    To TRANIO
    But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
    may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?

TRANIO

    Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
    That, being a stranger in this city here,
    Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
    Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
    Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
    In the preferment of the eldest sister.
    This liberty is all that I request,
    That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
    I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
    And free access and favour as the rest:
    And, toward the education of your daughters,
    I here bestow a simple instrument,
    And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
    If you accept them, then their worth is great.

BAPTISTA

    Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?

TRANIO

    Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.

BAPTISTA

    A mighty man of Pisa; by report
    I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
    Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
    You shall go see your pupils presently.
    Holla, within!

    Enter a Servant
    Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
    To my daughters; and tell them both,
    These are their tutors: bid them use them well.

    Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO, BIONDELLO following
    We will go walk a little in the orchard,
    And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
    And so I pray you all to think yourselves.

PETRUCHIO

    Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
    And every day I cannot come to woo.
    You knew my father well, and in him me,
    Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
    Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
    Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
    What dowry shall I have with her to wife?

BAPTISTA

    After my death the one half of my lands,
    And in possession twenty thousand crowns.

PETRUCHIO

    And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
    Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
    In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
    Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
    That covenants may be kept on either hand.

BAPTISTA

    Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
    That is, her love; for that is all in all.

PETRUCHIO

    Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
    I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
    And where two raging fires meet together
    They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
    Though little fire grows great with little wind,
    Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
    So I to her and so she yields to me;
    For I am rough and woo not like a babe.

BAPTISTA

    Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
    But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.

PETRUCHIO

    Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
    That shake not, though they blow perpetually.

    Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke

BAPTISTA

    How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?

HORTENSIO

    For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.

BAPTISTA

    What, will my daughter prove a good musician?

HORTENSIO

    I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
    Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.

BAPTISTA

    Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?

HORTENSIO

    Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
    I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
    And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
    When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
    'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
    with them:'
    And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
    And through the instrument my pate made way;
    And there I stood amazed for a while,
    As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
    While she did call me rascal fiddler
    And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
    As had she studied to misuse me so.

PETRUCHIO

    Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
    I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
    O, how I long to have some chat with her!

BAPTISTA

    Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
    Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
    She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
    Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
    Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?

PETRUCHIO

    I pray you do.

    Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO
    I will attend her here,
    And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
    Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
    She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
    Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
    As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
    Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
    Then I'll commend her volubility,
    And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
    If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
    As though she bid me stay by her a week:
    If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
    When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
    But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.

    Enter KATHARINA
    Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.

KATHARINA

    Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
    They call me Katharina that do talk of me.

PETRUCHIO

    You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
    And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
    But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
    Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
    For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
    Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
    Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
    Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
    Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
    Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.

KATHARINA

    Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
    Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
    You were a moveable.

PETRUCHIO

    Why, what's a moveable?

KATHARINA

    A join'd-stool.

PETRUCHIO

    Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.

KATHARINA

    Asses are made to bear, and so are you.

PETRUCHIO

    Women are made to bear, and so are you.

KATHARINA

    No such jade as you, if me you mean.

PETRUCHIO

    Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
    For, knowing thee to be but young and light--

KATHARINA

    Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
    And yet as heavy as my weight should be.

PETRUCHIO

    Should be! should--buzz!

KATHARINA

    Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO

    O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?

KATHARINA

    Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.

PETRUCHIO

    Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.

KATHARINA

    If I be waspish, best beware my sting.

PETRUCHIO

    My remedy is then, to pluck it out.

KATHARINA

    Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,

PETRUCHIO

    Who knows not where a wasp does
    wear his sting? In his tail.

KATHARINA

    In his tongue.

PETRUCHIO

    Whose tongue?

KATHARINA

    Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.

PETRUCHIO

    What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
    Good Kate; I am a gentleman.

KATHARINA

    That I'll try.

    She strikes him

PETRUCHIO

    I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.

KATHARINA

    So may you lose your arms:
    If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
    And if no gentleman, why then no arms.

PETRUCHIO

    A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!

KATHARINA

    What is your crest? a coxcomb?

PETRUCHIO

    A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.

KATHARINA

    No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.

PETRUCHIO

    Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.

KATHARINA

    It is my fashion, when I see a crab.

PETRUCHIO

    Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.

KATHARINA

    There is, there is.

PETRUCHIO

    Then show it me.

KATHARINA

    Had I a glass, I would.

PETRUCHIO

    What, you mean my face?

KATHARINA

    Well aim'd of such a young one.

PETRUCHIO

    Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.

KATHARINA

    Yet you are wither'd.

PETRUCHIO

    'Tis with cares.

KATHARINA

    I care not.

PETRUCHIO

    Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.

KATHARINA

    I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.

PETRUCHIO

    No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
    'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
    And now I find report a very liar;
    For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
    But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
    Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
    Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
    Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
    But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
    With gentle conference, soft and affable.
    Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
    O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
    Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
    As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
    O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.

KATHARINA

    Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.

PETRUCHIO

    Did ever Dian so become a grove
    As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
    O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
    And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!

KATHARINA

    Where did you study all this goodly speech?

PETRUCHIO

    It is extempore, from my mother-wit.

KATHARINA

    A witty mother! witless else her son.

PETRUCHIO

    Am I not wise?

KATHARINA

    Yes; keep you warm.

PETRUCHIO

    Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
    And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
    Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
    That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
    And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
    Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
    For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
    Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
    Thou must be married to no man but me;
    For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
    And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
    Conformable as other household Kates.
    Here comes your father: never make denial;
    I must and will have Katharina to my wife.

    Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO

BAPTISTA

    Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?

PETRUCHIO

    How but well, sir? how but well?
    It were impossible I should speed amiss.

BAPTISTA

    Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?

KATHARINA

    Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
    You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
    To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
    A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
    That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.

PETRUCHIO

    Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
    That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
    If she be curst, it is for policy,
    For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
    She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
    For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
    And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
    And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
    That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.

KATHARINA

    I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.

GREMIO

    Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
    hang'd first.

TRANIO

    Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!

PETRUCHIO

    Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
    If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
    'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
    That she shall still be curst in company.
    I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
    How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
    She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
    She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
    That in a twink she won me to her love.
    O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
    How tame, when men and women are alone,
    A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
    Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
    To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
    Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
    I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.

BAPTISTA

    I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
    God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.

GREMIO TRANIO

    Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.

PETRUCHIO

    Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
    I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
    We will have rings and things and fine array;
    And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.

    Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally

GREMIO

    Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?

BAPTISTA

    Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
    And venture madly on a desperate mart.

TRANIO

    'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
    'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.

BAPTISTA

    The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.

GREMIO

    No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
    But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
    Now is the day we long have looked for:
    I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.

TRANIO

    And I am one that love Bianca more
    Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.

GREMIO

    Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.

TRANIO

    Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.

GREMIO

    But thine doth fry.
    Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.

TRANIO

    But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.

BAPTISTA

    Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
    'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
    That can assure my daughter greatest dower
    Shall have my Bianca's love.
    Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?

GREMIO

    First, as you know, my house within the city
    Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
    Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
    My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
    In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
    In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
    Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
    Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
    Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
    Pewter and brass and all things that belong
    To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
    I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
    Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
    And all things answerable to this portion.
    Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
    And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
    If whilst I live she will be only mine.

TRANIO

    That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
    I am my father's heir and only son:
    If I may have your daughter to my wife,
    I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
    Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
    Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
    Besides two thousand ducats by the year
    Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
    What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?

GREMIO

    Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
    My land amounts not to so much in all:
    That she shall have; besides an argosy
    That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
    What, have I choked you with an argosy?

TRANIO

    Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
    Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
    And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
    And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.

GREMIO

    Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
    And she can have no more than all I have:
    If you like me, she shall have me and mine.

TRANIO

    Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
    By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.

BAPTISTA

    I must confess your offer is the best;
    And, let your father make her the assurance,
    She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
    if you should die before him, where's her dower?

TRANIO

    That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.

GREMIO

    And may not young men die, as well as old?

BAPTISTA

    Well, gentlemen,
    I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
    My daughter Katharina is to be married:
    Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
    Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
    If not, Signior Gremio:
    And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.

GREMIO

    Adieu, good neighbour.

    Exit BAPTISTA
    Now I fear thee not:
    Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
    To give thee all, and in his waning age
    Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
    An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.

    Exit

TRANIO

    A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
    Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
    'Tis in my head to do my master good:
    I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
    Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
    And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
    Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
    A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

    Exit

ACT III
SCENE I. Padua. BAPTISTA'S house.

    Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA

LUCENTIO

    Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
    Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
    Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?

HORTENSIO

    But, wrangling pedant, this is
    The patroness of heavenly harmony:
    Then give me leave to have prerogative;
    And when in music we have spent an hour,
    Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.

LUCENTIO

    Preposterous ass, that never read so far
    To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
    Was it not to refresh the mind of man
    After his studies or his usual pain?
    Then give me leave to read philosophy,
    And while I pause, serve in your harmony.

HORTENSIO

    Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.

BIANCA

    Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
    To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
    I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
    I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
    But learn my lessons as I please myself.
    And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
    Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
    His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.

HORTENSIO

    You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?

LUCENTIO

    That will be never: tune your instrument.

BIANCA

    Where left we last?

LUCENTIO

    Here, madam:
    'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
    Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'

BIANCA

    Construe them.

LUCENTIO

    'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
    Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
    'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
    'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes
    a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'
    bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might
    beguile the old pantaloon.

HORTENSIO

    Madam, my instrument's in tune.

BIANCA

    Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.

LUCENTIO

    Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.

BIANCA

    Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
    Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
    trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
    he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
    despair not.

HORTENSIO

    Madam, 'tis now in tune.

LUCENTIO

    All but the base.

HORTENSIO

    The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.

    Aside
    How fiery and forward our pedant is!
    Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
    Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.

BIANCA

    In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.

LUCENTIO

    Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
    Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.

BIANCA

    I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
    I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
    But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
    Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
    That I have been thus pleasant with you both.

HORTENSIO

    You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
    My lessons make no music in three parts.

LUCENTIO

    Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,

    Aside
    And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
    Our fine musician groweth amorous.

HORTENSIO

    Madam, before you touch the instrument,
    To learn the order of my fingering,
    I must begin with rudiments of art;
    To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
    More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
    Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
    And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.

BIANCA

    Why, I am past my gamut long ago.

HORTENSIO

    Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.

BIANCA

    [Reads] ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,
    'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion;
    'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,
    'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:
    'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:
    'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.'
    Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:
    Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,
    To change true rules for old inventions.

    Enter a Servant

Servant

    Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
    And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
    You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.

BIANCA

    Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.

    Exeunt BIANCA and Servant

LUCENTIO

    Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.

    Exit

HORTENSIO

    But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
    Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
    Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
    To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
    Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
    Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.

    Exit

SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.

    Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, LUCENTIO, and others, attendants

BAPTISTA

    [To TRANIO] Signior Lucentio, this is the
    'pointed day.
    That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,
    And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
    What will be said? what mockery will it be,
    To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
    To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
    What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?

KATHARINA

    No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
    To give my hand opposed against my heart
    Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
    Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
    I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
    Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
    And, to be noted for a merry man,
    He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
    Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
    Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
    Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
    And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
    If it would please him come and marry her!'

TRANIO

    Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
    Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
    Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
    Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
    Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.

KATHARINA

    Would Katharina had never seen him though!

    Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others

BAPTISTA

    Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
    For such an injury would vex a very saint,
    Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.

    Enter BIONDELLO

BIONDELLO

    Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
    you never heard of!

BAPTISTA

    Is it new and old too? how may that be?

BIONDELLO

    Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?

BAPTISTA

    Is he come?

BIONDELLO

    Why, no, sir.

BAPTISTA

    What then?

BIONDELLO

    He is coming.

BAPTISTA

    When will he be here?

BIONDELLO

    When he stands where I am and sees you there.

TRANIO

    But say, what to thine old news?

BIONDELLO

    Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
    jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
    of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
    another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
    town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
    with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
    old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
    besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
    in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected
    with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
    spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
    stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
    bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
    near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
    and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
    restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
    often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
    six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
    which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
    in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.

BAPTISTA

    Who comes with him?

BIONDELLO

    O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
    like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
    kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
    and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
    fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
    very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
    footboy or a gentleman's lackey.

TRANIO

    'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
    Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.

BAPTISTA

    I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.

BIONDELLO

    Why, sir, he comes not.

BAPTISTA

    Didst thou not say he comes?

BIONDELLO

    Who? that Petruchio came?

BAPTISTA

    Ay, that Petruchio came.

BIONDELLO

    No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.

BAPTISTA

    Why, that's all one.

BIONDELLO

    Nay, by Saint Jamy,
    I hold you a penny,
    A horse and a man
    Is more than one,
    And yet not many.

    Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO

PETRUCHIO

    Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?

BAPTISTA

    You are welcome, sir.

PETRUCHIO

    And yet I come not well.

BAPTISTA

    And yet you halt not.

TRANIO

    Not so well apparell'd
    As I wish you were.

PETRUCHIO

    Were it better, I should rush in thus.
    But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
    How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
    And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
    As if they saw some wondrous monument,
    Some comet or unusual prodigy?

BAPTISTA

    Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
    First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
    Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
    Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
    An eye-sore to our solemn festival!

TRANIO

    And tells us, what occasion of import
    Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
    And sent you hither so unlike yourself?

PETRUCHIO

    Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
    Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
    Though in some part enforced to digress;
    Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
    As you shall well be satisfied withal.
    But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
    The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.

TRANIO

    See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
    Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.

PETRUCHIO

    Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.

BAPTISTA

    But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.

PETRUCHIO

    Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
    To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
    Could I repair what she will wear in me,
    As I can change these poor accoutrements,
    'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
    But what a fool am I to chat with you,
    When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
    And seal the title with a lovely kiss!

    Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO

TRANIO

    He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
    We will persuade him, be it possible,
    To put on better ere he go to church.

BAPTISTA

    I'll after him, and see the event of this.

    Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants

TRANIO

    But to her love concerneth us to add
    Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
    As I before unparted to your worship,
    I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
    It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
    And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
    And make assurance here in Padua
    Of greater sums than I have promised.
    So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
    And marry sweet Bianca with consent.

LUCENTIO

    Were it not that my fellow-school-master
    Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
    'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
    Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
    I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.

TRANIO

    That by degrees we mean to look into,
    And watch our vantage in this business:
    We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
    The narrow-prying father, Minola,
    The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
    All for my master's sake, Lucentio.

    Re-enter GREMIO
    Signior Gremio, came you from the church?

GREMIO

    As willingly as e'er I came from school.

TRANIO

    And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?

GREMIO

    A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
    A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.

TRANIO

    Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.

GREMIO

    Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.

TRANIO

    Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.

GREMIO

    Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
    I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
    Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
    'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
    That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
    And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
    The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
    That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
    'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'

TRANIO

    What said the wench when he rose again?

GREMIO

    Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
    As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
    But after many ceremonies done,
    He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
    He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
    After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
    And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
    Having no other reason
    But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
    And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
    This done, he took the bride about the neck
    And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
    That at the parting all the church did echo:
    And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
    And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
    Such a mad marriage never was before:
    Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.

    Music

    Re-enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA, HORTENSIO, GRUMIO, and Train

PETRUCHIO

    Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
    I know you think to dine with me to-day,
    And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
    But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
    And therefore here I mean to take my leave.

BAPTISTA

    Is't possible you will away to-night?

PETRUCHIO

    I must away to-day, before night come:
    Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
    You would entreat me rather go than stay.
    And, honest company, I thank you all,
    That have beheld me give away myself
    To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
    Dine with my father, drink a health to me;
    For I must hence; and farewell to you all.

TRANIO

    Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.

PETRUCHIO

    It may not be.

GREMIO

    Let me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO

    It cannot be.

KATHARINA

    Let me entreat you.

PETRUCHIO

    I am content.

KATHARINA

    Are you content to stay?

PETRUCHIO

    I am content you shall entreat me stay;
    But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.

KATHARINA

    Now, if you love me, stay.

PETRUCHIO

    Grumio, my horse.

GRUMIO

    Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.

KATHARINA

    Nay, then,
    Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
    No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
    The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
    You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
    For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
    'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
    That take it on you at the first so roundly.

PETRUCHIO

    O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.

KATHARINA

    I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
    Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.

GREMIO

    Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.

KATARINA

    Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
    I see a woman may be made a fool,
    If she had not a spirit to resist.

PETRUCHIO

    They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
    Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
    Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
    Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
    Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
    But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
    Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
    I will be master of what is mine own:
    She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
    My household stuff, my field, my barn,
    My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
    And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
    I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
    That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
    Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
    Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
    Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
    thee, Kate:
    I'll buckler thee against a million.

    Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, and GRUMIO

BAPTISTA

    Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.

GREMIO

    Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.

TRANIO

    Of all mad matches never was the like.

LUCENTIO

    Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?

BIANCA

    That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.

GREMIO

    I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.

BAPTISTA

    Neighbours and friends, though bride and
    bridegroom wants
    For to supply the places at the table,
    You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
    Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:
    And let Bianca take her sister's room.

TRANIO

    Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?

BAPTISTA

    She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. PETRUCHIO'S country house.

    Enter GRUMIO

GRUMIO

    Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
    all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever
    man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
    before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
    warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
    hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
    tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
    belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
    I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
    considering the weather, a taller man than I will
    take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.

    Enter CURTIS

CURTIS

    Who is that calls so coldly?

GRUMIO

    A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
    from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
    but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.

CURTIS

    Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?

GRUMIO

    O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
    on no water.

CURTIS

    Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?

GRUMIO

    She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
    knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it
    hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
    myself, fellow Curtis.

CURTIS

    Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.

GRUMIO

    Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
    so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a
    fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,
    whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon
    feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?

CURTIS

    I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?

GRUMIO

    A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
    therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
    my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.

CURTIS

    There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.

GRUMIO

    Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
    will thaw.

CURTIS

    Come, you are so full of cony-catching!

GRUMIO

    Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
    Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
    trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
    serving-men in their new fustian, their white
    stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
    Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
    the carpets laid, and every thing in order?

CURTIS

    All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.

GRUMIO

    First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
    mistress fallen out.

CURTIS

    How?

GRUMIO

    Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
    hangs a tale.

CURTIS

    Let's ha't, good Grumio.

GRUMIO

    Lend thine ear.

CURTIS

    Here.

GRUMIO

    There.

    Strikes him

CURTIS

    This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.

GRUMIO

    And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
    cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
    listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
    foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--

CURTIS

    Both of one horse?

GRUMIO

    What's that to thee?

CURTIS

    Why, a horse.

GRUMIO

    Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
    thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
    under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how
    miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
    with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
    her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
    to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
    that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
    horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
    lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
    which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
    unexperienced to thy grave.

CURTIS

    By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.

GRUMIO

    Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
    find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
    Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
    Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
    sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
    garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
    with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
    of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their
    hands. Are they all ready?

CURTIS

    They are.

GRUMIO

    Call them forth.

CURTIS

    Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
    countenance my mistress.

GRUMIO

    Why, she hath a face of her own.

CURTIS

    Who knows not that?

GRUMIO

    Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
    countenance her.

CURTIS

    I call them forth to credit her.

GRUMIO

    Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.

    Enter four or five Serving-men

NATHANIEL

    Welcome home, Grumio!

PHILIP

    How now, Grumio!

JOSEPH

    What, Grumio!

NICHOLAS

    Fellow Grumio!

NATHANIEL

    How now, old lad?

GRUMIO

    Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
    you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
    companions, is all ready, and all things neat?

NATHANIEL

    All things is ready. How near is our master?

GRUMIO

    E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
    not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.

    Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA

PETRUCHIO

    Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
    To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
    Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
    ALL SERVING-MEN Here, here, sir; here, sir.

PETRUCHIO

    Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
    You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
    What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
    Where is the foolish knave I sent before?

GRUMIO

    Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.

PETRUCHIO

    You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
    Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
    And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?

GRUMIO

    Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
    And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;
    There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
    And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:
    There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
    The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
    Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.

PETRUCHIO

    Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.

    Exeunt Servants

    Singing
    Where is the life that late I led--
    Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
    Sound, sound, sound, sound!

    Re-enter Servants with supper
    Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
    Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?

    Sings
    It was the friar of orders grey,
    As he forth walked on his way:--
    Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
    Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.

    Strikes him
    Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
    Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
    And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
    One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
    Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?

    Enter one with water
    Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
    You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?

    Strikes him

KATHARINA

    Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.

PETRUCHIO

    A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
    Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
    Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
    What's this? mutton?

First Servant

    Ay.

PETRUCHIO

    Who brought it?

PETER

    I.

PETRUCHIO

    'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
    What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
    How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
    And serve it thus to me that love it not?
    Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;

    Throws the meat, & c. about the stage
    You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
    What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.

KATHARINA

    I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
    The meat was well, if you were so contented.

PETRUCHIO

    I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
    And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
    For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
    And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
    Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
    Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
    Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
    And, for this night, we'll fast for company:
    Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.

    Exeunt

    Re-enter Servants severally

    Peter, didst ever see the like?

    He kills her in her own humour.

    Re-enter CURTIS

GRUMIO

    Where is he?

CURTIS

    In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
    And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
    Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
    And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
    Away, away! for he is coming hither.

    Exeunt

    Re-enter PETRUCHIO

PETRUCHIO

    Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
    And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
    My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
    And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
    For then she never looks upon her lure.
    Another way I have to man my haggard,
    To make her come and know her keeper's call,
    That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
    That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
    She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
    Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
    As with the meat, some undeserved fault
    I'll find about the making of the bed;
    And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
    This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
    Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
    That all is done in reverend care of her;
    And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
    And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
    And with the clamour keep her still awake.
    This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
    And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
    He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
    Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.

SCENE II. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.

    Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO

TRANIO

    Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
    Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
    I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.

HORTENSIO

    Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
    Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.

    Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO

LUCENTIO

    Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?

BIANCA

    What, master, read you? first resolve me that.

LUCENTIO

    I read that I profess, the Art to Love.

BIANCA

    And may you prove, sir, master of your art!

LUCENTIO

    While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!

HORTENSIO

    Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
    You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
    Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.

TRANIO

    O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
    I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.

HORTENSIO

    Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
    Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
    But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
    For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
    And makes a god of such a cullion:
    Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.

TRANIO

    Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
    Of your entire affection to Bianca;
    And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
    I will with you, if you be so contented,
    Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.

HORTENSIO

    See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
    Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
    Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
    As one unworthy all the former favours
    That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.

TRANIO

    And here I take the unfeigned oath,
    Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
    Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!

HORTENSIO

    Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
    For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
    I will be married to a wealthy widow,
    Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
    As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
    And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
    Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
    Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
    In resolution as I swore before.

    Exit

TRANIO

    Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
    As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
    Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
    And have forsworn you with Hortensio.

BIANCA

    Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?

TRANIO

    Mistress, we have.

LUCENTIO

    Then we are rid of Licio.

TRANIO

    I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
    That shall be wood and wedded in a day.

BIANCA

    God give him joy!

TRANIO

    Ay, and he'll tame her.

BIANCA

    He says so, Tranio.

TRANIO

    Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.

BIANCA

    The taming-school! what, is there such a place?

TRANIO

    Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
    That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
    To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.

    Enter BIONDELLO

BIONDELLO

    O master, master, I have watch'd so long
    That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
    An ancient angel coming down the hill,
    Will serve the turn.

TRANIO

    What is he, Biondello?

BIONDELLO

    Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
    I know not what; but format in apparel,
    In gait and countenance surely like a father.

LUCENTIO

    And what of him, Tranio?

TRANIO

    If he be credulous and trust my tale,
    I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
    And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
    As if he were the right Vincentio
    Take in your love, and then let me alone.

    Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA

    Enter a Pedant

Pedant

    God save you, sir!

TRANIO

    And you, sir! you are welcome.
    Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?

Pedant

    Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
    But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
    And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.

TRANIO

    What countryman, I pray?

Pedant

    Of Mantua.

TRANIO

    Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
    And come to Padua, careless of your life?

Pedant

    My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.

TRANIO

    'Tis death for any one in Mantua
    To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
    Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
    For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
    Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
    'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
    You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.

Pedant

    Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
    For I have bills for money by exchange
    From Florence and must here deliver them.

TRANIO

    Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
    This will I do, and this I will advise you:
    First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?

Pedant

    Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
    Pisa renowned for grave citizens.

TRANIO

    Among them know you one Vincentio?

Pedant

    I know him not, but I have heard of him;
    A merchant of incomparable wealth.

TRANIO

    He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
    In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.

BIONDELLO

    [Aside] As much as an apple doth an oyster,
    and all one.

TRANIO

    To save your life in this extremity,
    This favour will I do you for his sake;
    And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
    That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
    His name and credit shall you undertake,
    And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
    Look that you take upon you as you should;
    You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
    Till you have done your business in the city:
    If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.

Pedant

    O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
    The patron of my life and liberty.

TRANIO

    Then go with me to make the matter good.
    This, by the way, I let you understand;
    my father is here look'd for every day,
    To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
    'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
    In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
    Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in PETRUCHIO'S house.

    Enter KATHARINA and GRUMIO

GRUMIO

    No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.

KATHARINA

    The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
    What, did he marry me to famish me?
    Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
    Upon entreaty have a present aims;
    If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
    But I, who never knew how to entreat,
    Nor never needed that I should entreat,
    Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
    With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
    And that which spites me more than all these wants,
    He does it under name of perfect love;
    As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
    'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
    I prithee go and get me some repast;
    I care not what, so it be wholesome food.

GRUMIO

    What say you to a neat's foot?

KATHARINA

    'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.

GRUMIO

    I fear it is too choleric a meat.
    How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?

KATHARINA

    I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.

GRUMIO

    I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
    What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?

KATHARINA

    A dish that I do love to feed upon.

GRUMIO

    Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.

KATHARINA

    Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.

GRUMIO

    Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
    Or else you get no beef of Grumio.

KATHARINA

    Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.

GRUMIO

    Why then, the mustard without the beef.

KATHARINA

    Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,

    Beats him
    That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
    Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
    That triumph thus upon my misery!
    Go, get thee gone, I say.

    Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat

PETRUCHIO

    How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?

HORTENSIO

    Mistress, what cheer?

KATHARINA

    Faith, as cold as can be.

PETRUCHIO

    Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
    Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am
    To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
    I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
    What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;
    And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
    Here, take away this dish.

KATHARINA

    I pray you, let it stand.

PETRUCHIO

    The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
    And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.

KATHARINA

    I thank you, sir.

HORTENSIO

    Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
    Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.

PETRUCHIO

    [Aside] Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.
    Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
    Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,
    Will we return unto thy father's house
    And revel it as bravely as the best,
    With silken coats and caps and golden rings,
    With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things;
    With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,
    With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery.
    What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,
    To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.

    Enter Tailor
    Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
    Lay forth the gown.

    Enter Haberdasher
    What news with you, sir?

Haberdasher

    Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.

PETRUCHIO

    Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
    A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
    Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
    A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
    Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.

KATHARINA

    I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
    And gentlewomen wear such caps as these

PETRUCHIO

    When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
    And not till then.

HORTENSIO

    [Aside] That will not be in haste.

KATHARINA

    Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
    And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
    Your betters have endured me say my mind,
    And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
    My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
    Or else my heart concealing it will break,
    And rather than it shall, I will be free
    Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.

PETRUCHIO

    Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
    A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
    I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.

KATHARINA

    Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
    And it I will have, or I will have none.

    Exit Haberdasher

PETRUCHIO

    Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
    O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
    What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
    What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
    Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
    Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
    Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?

HORTENSIO

    [Aside] I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.

Tailor

    You bid me make it orderly and well,
    According to the fashion and the time.

PETRUCHIO

    Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
    I did not bid you mar it to the time.
    Go, hop me over every kennel home,
    For you shall hop without my custom, sir:
    I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.

KATHARINA

    I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
    More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
    Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.

PETRUCHIO

    Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.

Tailor

    She says your worship means to make
    a puppet of her.

PETRUCHIO

    O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
    thou thimble,
    Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
    Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
    Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
    Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
    Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
    As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
    I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.

Tailor

    Your worship is deceived; the gown is made
    Just as my master had direction:
    Grumio gave order how it should be done.

GRUMIO

    I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.

Tailor

    But how did you desire it should be made?

GRUMIO

    Marry, sir, with needle and thread.

Tailor

    But did you not request to have it cut?

GRUMIO

    Thou hast faced many things.

Tailor

    I have.

GRUMIO

    Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
    me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto
    thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did
    not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.

Tailor

    Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify

PETRUCHIO

    Read it.

GRUMIO

    The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.

Tailor

    [Reads] 'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:'

GRUMIO

    Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
    the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom
    of brown thread: I said a gown.

PETRUCHIO

    Proceed.

Tailor

    [Reads] 'With a small compassed cape:'

GRUMIO

    I confess the cape.

Tailor

    [Reads] 'With a trunk sleeve:'

GRUMIO

    I confess two sleeves.

Tailor

    [Reads] 'The sleeves curiously cut.'

PETRUCHIO

    Ay, there's the villany.

GRUMIO

    Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
    I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
    sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,
    though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.

Tailor

    This is true that I say: an I had thee
    in place where, thou shouldst know it.

GRUMIO

    I am for thee straight: take thou the
    bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.

HORTENSIO

    God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.

PETRUCHIO

    Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.

GRUMIO

    You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.

PETRUCHIO

    Go, take it up unto thy master's use.

GRUMIO

    Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'
    gown for thy master's use!

PETRUCHIO

    Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?

GRUMIO

    O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
    Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
    O, fie, fie, fie!

PETRUCHIO

    [Aside] Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.
    Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.

HORTENSIO

    Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:
    Take no unkindness of his hasty words:
    Away! I say; commend me to thy master.

    Exit Tailor

PETRUCHIO

    Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
    Even in these honest mean habiliments:
    Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
    For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
    And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
    So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
    What is the jay more precious than the lark,
    Because his fathers are more beautiful?
    Or is the adder better than the eel,
    Because his painted skin contents the eye?
    O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
    For this poor furniture and mean array.
    if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;
    And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
    To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
    Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
    And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
    There will we mount, and thither walk on foot
    Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
    And well we may come there by dinner-time.

KATHARINA

    I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
    And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.

PETRUCHIO

    It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
    Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
    You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
    I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
    It shall be what o'clock I say it is.

HORTENSIO

    [Aside] Why, so this gallant will command the sun.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.

    Enter TRANIO, and the Pedant dressed like VINCENTIO

TRANIO

    Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?

Pedant

    Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
    Signior Baptista may remember me,
    Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
    Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.

TRANIO

    'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
    With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.

Pedant

    I warrant you.

    Enter BIONDELLO
    But, sir, here comes your boy;
    'Twere good he were school'd.

TRANIO

    Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
    Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
    Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.

BIONDELLO

    Tut, fear not me.

TRANIO

    But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?

BIONDELLO

    I told him that your father was at Venice,
    And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.

TRANIO

    Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
    Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.

    Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO
    Signior Baptista, you are happily met.

    To the Pedant
    Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
    I pray you stand good father to me now,
    Give me Bianca for my patrimony.

Pedant

    Soft son!
    Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
    To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
    Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
    Of love between your daughter and himself:
    And, for the good report I hear of you
    And for the love he beareth to your daughter
    And she to him, to stay him not too long,
    I am content, in a good father's care,
    To have him match'd; and if you please to like
    No worse than I, upon some agreement
    Me shall you find ready and willing
    With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
    For curious I cannot be with you,
    Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.

BAPTISTA

    Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
    Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
    Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
    Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
    Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
    And therefore, if you say no more than this,
    That like a father you will deal with him
    And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
    The match is made, and all is done:
    Your son shall have my daughter with consent.

TRANIO

    I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
    We be affied and such assurance ta'en
    As shall with either part's agreement stand?

BAPTISTA

    Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
    Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
    Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
    And happily we might be interrupted.

TRANIO

    Then at my lodging, an it like you:
    There doth my father lie; and there, this night,
    We'll pass the business privately and well.
    Send for your daughter by your servant here:
    My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
    The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
    You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.

BAPTISTA

    It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
    And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
    And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
    Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
    And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.

BIONDELLO

    I pray the gods she may with all my heart!

TRANIO

    Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.

    Exit BIONDELLO
    Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
    Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:
    Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.

BAPTISTA

    I follow you.

    Exeunt TRANIO, Pedant, and BAPTISTA

    Re-enter BIONDELLO

BIONDELLO

    Cambio!

LUCENTIO

    What sayest thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO

    You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?

LUCENTIO

    Biondello, what of that?

BIONDELLO

    Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to
    expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.

LUCENTIO

    I pray thee, moralize them.

BIONDELLO

    Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
    deceiving father of a deceitful son.

LUCENTIO

    And what of him?

BIONDELLO

    His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.

LUCENTIO

    And then?

BIONDELLO

    The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
    command at all hours.

LUCENTIO

    And what of all this?

BIONDELLO

    I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
    counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
    'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
    church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
    honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
    I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
    ever and a day.

LUCENTIO

    Hearest thou, Biondello?

BIONDELLO

    I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
    afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
    stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
    sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
    Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
    you come with your appendix.

    Exit

LUCENTIO

    I may, and will, if she be so contented:
    She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?
    Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
    It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.

    Exit

SCENE V. A public road.

    Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Servants

PETRUCHIO

    Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
    Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!

KATHARINA

    The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.

PETRUCHIO

    I say it is the moon that shines so bright.

KATHARINA

    I know it is the sun that shines so bright.

PETRUCHIO

    Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
    It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
    Or ere I journey to your father's house.
    Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
    Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!

HORTENSIO

    Say as he says, or we shall never go.

KATHARINA

    Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
    And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
    An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
    Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.

PETRUCHIO

    I say it is the moon.

KATHARINA

    I know it is the moon.

PETRUCHIO

    Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.

KATHARINA

    Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
    But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
    And the moon changes even as your mind.
    What you will have it named, even that it is;
    And so it shall be so for Katharina.

HORTENSIO

    Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.

PETRUCHIO

    Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
    And not unluckily against the bias.
    But, soft! company is coming here.

    Enter VINCENTIO

    To VINCENTIO
    Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
    Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
    Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
    Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
    What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
    As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
    Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
    Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.

HORTENSIO

    A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.

KATHARINA

    Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
    Whither away, or where is thy abode?
    Happy the parents of so fair a child;
    Happier the man, whom favourable stars
    Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!

PETRUCHIO

    Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
    This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
    And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.

KATHARINA

    Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
    That have been so bedazzled with the sun
    That everything I look on seemeth green:
    Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
    Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.

PETRUCHIO

    Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
    Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
    We shall be joyful of thy company.

VINCENTIO

    Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
    That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
    My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
    And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
    A son of mine, which long I have not seen.

PETRUCHIO

    What is his name?

VINCENTIO

    Lucentio, gentle sir.

PETRUCHIO

    Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
    And now by law, as well as reverend age,
    I may entitle thee my loving father:
    The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
    Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
    Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
    Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
    Beside, so qualified as may beseem
    The spouse of any noble gentleman.
    Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
    And wander we to see thy honest son,
    Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.

VINCENTIO

    But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
    Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
    Upon the company you overtake?

HORTENSIO

    I do assure thee, father, so it is.

PETRUCHIO

    Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
    For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.

    Exeunt all but HORTENSIO

HORTENSIO

    Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
    Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
    Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.

    Exit

ACT V
SCENE I. Padua. Before LUCENTIO'S house.

    GREMIO discovered. Enter behind BIONDELLO, LUCENTIO, and BIANCA

BIONDELLO

    Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.

LUCENTIO

    I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
    at home; therefore leave us.

BIONDELLO

    Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
    then come back to my master's as soon as I can.

    Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO

GREMIO

    I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.

    Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO, with Attendants

PETRUCHIO

    Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
    My father's bears more toward the market-place;
    Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.

VINCENTIO

    You shall not choose but drink before you go:
    I think I shall command your welcome here,
    And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.

    Knocks

GREMIO

    They're busy within; you were best knock louder.

    Pedant looks out of the window

Pedant

    What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?

VINCENTIO

    Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?

Pedant

    He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.

VINCENTIO

    What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
    make merry withal?

Pedant

    Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
    need none, so long as I live.

PETRUCHIO

    Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
    Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
    I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
    come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.

Pedant

    Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
    looking out at the window.

VINCENTIO

    Art thou his father?

Pedant

    Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.

PETRUCHIO

    [To VINCENTIO] Why, how now, gentleman! why, this
    is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.

Pedant

    Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
    cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.

    Re-enter BIONDELLO

BIONDELLO

    I have seen them in the church together: God send
    'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
    master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.

VINCENTIO

    [Seeing BIONDELLO]
    Come hither, crack-hemp.

BIONDELLO

    Hope I may choose, sir.

VINCENTIO

    Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?

BIONDELLO

    Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
    never saw you before in all my life.

VINCENTIO

    What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
    thy master's father, Vincentio?

BIONDELLO

    What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
    see where he looks out of the window.

VINCENTIO

    Is't so, indeed.

    Beats BIONDELLO

BIONDELLO

    Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.

    Exit

Pedant

    Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!

    Exit from above

PETRUCHIO

    Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
    this controversy.

    They retire

    Re-enter Pedant below; TRANIO, BAPTISTA, and Servants

TRANIO

    Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?

VINCENTIO

    What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
    gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
    hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
    am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
    husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
    the university.

TRANIO

    How now! what's the matter?

BAPTISTA

    What, is the man lunatic?

TRANIO

    Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
    habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
    what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
    thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.

VINCENTIO

    Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.

BAPTISTA

    You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
    you think is his name?

VINCENTIO

    His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
    him up ever since he was three years old, and his
    name is Tranio.

Pedant

    Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
    mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.

VINCENTIO

    Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
    on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
    son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?

TRANIO

    Call forth an officer.

    Enter one with an Officer
    Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
    I charge you see that he be forthcoming.

VINCENTIO

    Carry me to the gaol!

GREMIO

    Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.

BAPTISTA

    Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.

GREMIO

    Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
    cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
    is the right Vincentio.

Pedant

    Swear, if thou darest.

GREMIO

    Nay, I dare not swear it.

TRANIO

    Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.

GREMIO

    Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.

BAPTISTA

    Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!

VINCENTIO

    Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
    monstrous villain!

    Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA

BIONDELLO

    O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
    forswear him, or else we are all undone.

LUCENTIO

    [Kneeling] Pardon, sweet father.

VINCENTIO

    Lives my sweet son?

    Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and Pedant, as fast as may be

BIANCA

    Pardon, dear father.

BAPTISTA

    How hast thou offended?
    Where is Lucentio?

LUCENTIO

    Here's Lucentio,
    Right son to the right Vincentio;
    That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
    While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.

GREMIO

    Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!

VINCENTIO

    Where is that damned villain Tranio,
    That faced and braved me in this matter so?

BAPTISTA

    Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?

BIANCA

    Cambio is changed into Lucentio.

LUCENTIO

    Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
    Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
    While he did bear my countenance in the town;
    And happily I have arrived at the last
    Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
    What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
    Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.

VINCENTIO

    I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
    me to the gaol.

BAPTISTA

    But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
    without asking my good will?

VINCENTIO

    Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
    I will in, to be revenged for this villany.

    Exit

BAPTISTA

    And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.

    Exit

LUCENTIO

    Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.

    Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA

GREMIO

    My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
    Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.

    Exit

KATHARINA

    Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.

PETRUCHIO

    First kiss me, Kate, and we will.

KATHARINA

    What, in the midst of the street?

PETRUCHIO

    What, art thou ashamed of me?

KATHARINA

    No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.

PETRUCHIO

    Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.

KATHARINA

    Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.

PETRUCHIO

    Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
    Better once than never, for never too late.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Padua. LUCENTIO'S house.

    Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the Pedant, LUCENTIO, BIANCA, PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Widow, TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO the Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet

LUCENTIO

    At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
    And time it is, when raging war is done,
    To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
    My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
    While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
    Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
    And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
    Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
    My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
    After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
    For now we sit to chat as well as eat.

PETRUCHIO

    Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!

BAPTISTA

    Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.

PETRUCHIO

    Padua affords nothing but what is kind.

HORTENSIO

    For both our sakes, I would that word were true.

PETRUCHIO

    Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.

Widow

    Then never trust me, if I be afeard.

PETRUCHIO

    You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
    I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.

Widow

    He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.

PETRUCHIO

    Roundly replied.

KATHARINA

    Mistress, how mean you that?

Widow

    Thus I conceive by him.

PETRUCHIO

    Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?

HORTENSIO

    My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.

PETRUCHIO

    Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.

KATHARINA

    'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
    I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.

Widow

    Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
    Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
    And now you know my meaning,

KATHARINA

    A very mean meaning.

Widow

    Right, I mean you.

KATHARINA

    And I am mean indeed, respecting you.

PETRUCHIO

    To her, Kate!

HORTENSIO

    To her, widow!

PETRUCHIO

    A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.

HORTENSIO

    That's my office.

PETRUCHIO

    Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!

    Drinks to HORTENSIO

BAPTISTA

    How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?

GREMIO

    Believe me, sir, they butt together well.

BIANCA

    Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
    Would say your head and butt were head and horn.

VINCENTIO

    Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?

BIANCA

    Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.

PETRUCHIO

    Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,
    Have at you for a bitter jest or two!

BIANCA

    Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
    And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
    You are welcome all.

    Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow

PETRUCHIO

    She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
    This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
    Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.

TRANIO

    O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
    Which runs himself and catches for his master.

PETRUCHIO

    A good swift simile, but something currish.

TRANIO

    'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
    'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.

BAPTISTA

    O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.

LUCENTIO

    I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.

HORTENSIO

    Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?

PETRUCHIO

    A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
    And, as the jest did glance away from me,
    'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.

BAPTISTA

    Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
    I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.

PETRUCHIO

    Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
    Let's each one send unto his wife;
    And he whose wife is most obedient
    To come at first when he doth send for her,
    Shall win the wager which we will propose.

HORTENSIO

    Content. What is the wager?

LUCENTIO

    Twenty crowns.

PETRUCHIO

    Twenty crowns!
    I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
    But twenty times so much upon my wife.

LUCENTIO

    A hundred then.

HORTENSIO

    Content.

PETRUCHIO

    A match! 'tis done.

HORTENSIO

    Who shall begin?

LUCENTIO

    That will I.
    Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.

BIONDELLO

    I go.

    Exit

BAPTISTA

    Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.

LUCENTIO

    I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.

    Re-enter BIONDELLO
    How now! what news?

BIONDELLO

    Sir, my mistress sends you word
    That she is busy and she cannot come.

PETRUCHIO

    How! she is busy and she cannot come!
    Is that an answer?

GREMIO

    Ay, and a kind one too:
    Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.

PETRUCHIO

    I hope better.

HORTENSIO

    Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
    To come to me forthwith.

    Exit BIONDELLO

PETRUCHIO

    O, ho! entreat her!
    Nay, then she must needs come.

HORTENSIO

    I am afraid, sir,
    Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.

    Re-enter BIONDELLO
    Now, where's my wife?

BIONDELLO

    She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
    She will not come: she bids you come to her.

PETRUCHIO

    Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
    Intolerable, not to be endured!
    Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
    Say, I command her to come to me.

    Exit GRUMIO

HORTENSIO

    I know her answer.

PETRUCHIO

    What?

HORTENSIO

    She will not.

PETRUCHIO

    The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.

BAPTISTA

    Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!

    Re-enter KATARINA

KATHARINA

    What is your will, sir, that you send for me?

PETRUCHIO

    Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?

KATHARINA

    They sit conferring by the parlor fire.

PETRUCHIO

    Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
    Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
    Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.

    Exit KATHARINA

LUCENTIO

    Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.

HORTENSIO

    And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.

PETRUCHIO

    Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
    And awful rule and right supremacy;
    And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?

BAPTISTA

    Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
    The wager thou hast won; and I will add
    Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
    Another dowry to another daughter,
    For she is changed, as she had never been.

PETRUCHIO

    Nay, I will win my wager better yet
    And show more sign of her obedience,
    Her new-built virtue and obedience.
    See where she comes and brings your froward wives
    As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.

    Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow
    Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
    Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.

Widow

    Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
    Till I be brought to such a silly pass!

BIANCA

    Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?

LUCENTIO

    I would your duty were as foolish too:
    The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
    Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.

BIANCA

    The more fool you, for laying on my duty.

PETRUCHIO

    Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
    What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.

Widow

    Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.

PETRUCHIO

    Come on, I say; and first begin with her.

Widow

    She shall not.

PETRUCHIO

    I say she shall: and first begin with her.

KATHARINA

    Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
    And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
    To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
    It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
    Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
    And in no sense is meet or amiable.
    A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
    Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
    And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
    Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
    Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
    Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
    And for thy maintenance commits his body
    To painful labour both by sea and land,
    To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
    Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
    And craves no other tribute at thy hands
    But love, fair looks and true obedience;
    Too little payment for so great a debt.
    Such duty as the subject owes the prince
    Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
    And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
    And not obedient to his honest will,
    What is she but a foul contending rebel
    And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
    I am ashamed that women are so simple
    To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
    Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
    When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
    Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
    Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
    But that our soft conditions and our hearts
    Should well agree with our external parts?
    Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
    My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
    My heart as great, my reason haply more,
    To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
    But now I see our lances are but straws,
    Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
    That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
    Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
    And place your hands below your husband's foot:
    In token of which duty, if he please,
    My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

PETRUCHIO

    Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.

LUCENTIO

    Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.

VINCENTIO

    'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.

LUCENTIO

    But a harsh hearing when women are froward.

PETRUCHIO

    Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
    We three are married, but you two are sped.

    To LUCENTIO
    'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
    And, being a winner, God give you good night!

    Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA

HORTENSIO

    Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.

LUCENTIO

    'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.

    Exeunt


The Tempest

ACT I
SCENE I. On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise

    of thunder and lightning heard.

    Enter a Master and a Boatswain

Master

    Boatswain!

Boatswain

    Here, master: what cheer?

Master

    Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
    or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.

    Exit

    Enter Mariners

Boatswain

    Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
    yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
    master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
    if room enough!

    Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND, GONZALO, and others

ALONSO

    Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
    Play the men.

Boatswain

    I pray now, keep below.

ANTONIO

    Where is the master, boatswain?

Boatswain

    Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
    cabins: you do assist the storm.

GONZALO

    Nay, good, be patient.

Boatswain

    When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
    for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.

GONZALO

    Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.

Boatswain

    None that I more love than myself. You are a
    counsellor; if you can command these elements to
    silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
    not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
    cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
    yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
    the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
    of our way, I say.

    Exit

GONZALO

    I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
    hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
    perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
    hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
    for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
    born to be hanged, our case is miserable.

    Exeunt

    Re-enter Boatswain

Boatswain

    Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
    her to try with main-course.

    A cry within
    A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
    the weather or our office.

    Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO
    Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
    and drown? Have you a mind to sink?

SEBASTIAN

    A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
    incharitable dog!

Boatswain

    Work you then.

ANTONIO

    Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
    We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.

GONZALO

    I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
    no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
    unstanched wench.

Boatswain

    Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
    sea again; lay her off.

    Enter Mariners wet

Mariners

    All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!

Boatswain

    What, must our mouths be cold?

GONZALO

    The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
    For our case is as theirs.

SEBASTIAN

    I'm out of patience.

ANTONIO

    We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
    This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
    The washing of ten tides!

GONZALO

    He'll be hang'd yet,
    Though every drop of water swear against it
    And gape at widest to glut him.

    A confused noise within: 'Mercy on us!'-- 'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and children!'-- 'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!'

ANTONIO

    Let's all sink with the king.

SEBASTIAN

    Let's take leave of him.

    Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN

GONZALO

    Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
    acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
    thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
    die a dry death.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.

    Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA

MIRANDA

    If by your art, my dearest father, you have
    Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
    The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
    But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
    Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
    With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
    Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
    Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
    Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
    Had I been any god of power, I would
    Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
    It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
    The fraughting souls within her.

PROSPERO

    Be collected:
    No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
    There's no harm done.

MIRANDA

    O, woe the day!

PROSPERO

    No harm.
    I have done nothing but in care of thee,
    Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
    Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
    Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
    Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
    And thy no greater father.

MIRANDA

    More to know
    Did never meddle with my thoughts.

PROSPERO

    'Tis time
    I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
    And pluck my magic garment from me. So:

    Lays down his mantle
    Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
    The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
    The very virtue of compassion in thee,
    I have with such provision in mine art
    So safely ordered that there is no soul--
    No, not so much perdition as an hair
    Betid to any creature in the vessel
    Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
    For thou must now know farther.

MIRANDA

    You have often
    Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
    And left me to a bootless inquisition,
    Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'

PROSPERO

    The hour's now come;
    The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
    Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
    A time before we came unto this cell?
    I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
    Out three years old.

MIRANDA

    Certainly, sir, I can.

PROSPERO

    By what? by any other house or person?
    Of any thing the image tell me that
    Hath kept with thy remembrance.

MIRANDA

    'Tis far off
    And rather like a dream than an assurance
    That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
    Four or five women once that tended me?

PROSPERO

    Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
    That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
    In the dark backward and abysm of time?
    If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
    How thou camest here thou mayst.

MIRANDA

    But that I do not.

PROSPERO

    Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
    Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
    A prince of power.

MIRANDA

    Sir, are not you my father?

PROSPERO

    Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
    She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
    Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
    And princess no worse issued.

MIRANDA

    O the heavens!
    What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
    Or blessed was't we did?

PROSPERO

    Both, both, my girl:
    By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
    But blessedly holp hither.

MIRANDA

    O, my heart bleeds
    To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
    Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.

PROSPERO

    My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
    I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
    Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
    Of all the world I loved and to him put
    The manage of my state; as at that time
    Through all the signories it was the first
    And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
    In dignity, and for the liberal arts
    Without a parallel; those being all my study,
    The government I cast upon my brother
    And to my state grew stranger, being transported
    And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
    Dost thou attend me?

MIRANDA

    Sir, most heedfully.

PROSPERO

    Being once perfected how to grant suits,
    How to deny them, who to advance and who
    To trash for over-topping, new created
    The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
    Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
    Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
    To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
    The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
    And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.

MIRANDA

    O, good sir, I do.

PROSPERO

    I pray thee, mark me.
    I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
    To closeness and the bettering of my mind
    With that which, but by being so retired,
    O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
    Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
    Like a good parent, did beget of him
    A falsehood in its contrary as great
    As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
    A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
    Not only with what my revenue yielded,
    But what my power might else exact, like one
    Who having into truth, by telling of it,
    Made such a sinner of his memory,
    To credit his own lie, he did believe
    He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
    And executing the outward face of royalty,
    With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
    Dost thou hear?

MIRANDA

    Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.

PROSPERO

    To have no screen between this part he play'd
    And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
    Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
    Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
    He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
    So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
    To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
    Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
    The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
    To most ignoble stooping.

MIRANDA

    O the heavens!

PROSPERO

    Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
    If this might be a brother.

MIRANDA

    I should sin
    To think but nobly of my grandmother:
    Good wombs have borne bad sons.

PROSPERO

    Now the condition.
    The King of Naples, being an enemy
    To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
    Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
    Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
    Should presently extirpate me and mine
    Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
    With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
    A treacherous army levied, one midnight
    Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
    The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
    The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
    Me and thy crying self.

MIRANDA

    Alack, for pity!
    I, not remembering how I cried out then,
    Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
    That wrings mine eyes to't.

PROSPERO

    Hear a little further
    And then I'll bring thee to the present business
    Which now's upon's; without the which this story
    Were most impertinent.

MIRANDA

    Wherefore did they not
    That hour destroy us?

PROSPERO

    Well demanded, wench:
    My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
    So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
    A mark so bloody on the business, but
    With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
    In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
    Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
    A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
    Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
    Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
    To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
    To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
    Did us but loving wrong.

MIRANDA

    Alack, what trouble
    Was I then to you!

PROSPERO

    O, a cherubim
    Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
    Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
    When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
    Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
    An undergoing stomach, to bear up
    Against what should ensue.

MIRANDA

    How came we ashore?

PROSPERO

    By Providence divine.
    Some food we had and some fresh water that
    A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
    Out of his charity, being then appointed
    Master of this design, did give us, with
    Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
    Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
    Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
    From mine own library with volumes that
    I prize above my dukedom.

MIRANDA

    Would I might
    But ever see that man!

PROSPERO

    Now I arise:

    Resumes his mantle
    Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
    Here in this island we arrived; and here
    Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
    Than other princesses can that have more time
    For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.

MIRANDA

    Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
    For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
    For raising this sea-storm?

PROSPERO

    Know thus far forth.
    By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
    Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
    Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
    I find my zenith doth depend upon
    A most auspicious star, whose influence
    If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
    Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
    Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
    And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.

    MIRANDA sleeps
    Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
    Approach, my Ariel, come.

    Enter ARIEL

ARIEL

    All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
    To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
    To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
    On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
    Ariel and all his quality.

PROSPERO

    Hast thou, spirit,
    Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?

ARIEL

    To every article.
    I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
    Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
    I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
    And burn in many places; on the topmast,
    The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
    Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
    O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
    And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
    Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
    Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
    Yea, his dread trident shake.

PROSPERO

    My brave spirit!
    Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
    Would not infect his reason?

ARIEL

    Not a soul
    But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
    Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
    Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
    Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
    With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
    Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
    And all the devils are here.'

PROSPERO

    Why that's my spirit!
    But was not this nigh shore?

ARIEL

    Close by, my master.

PROSPERO

    But are they, Ariel, safe?

ARIEL

    Not a hair perish'd;
    On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
    But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
    In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
    The king's son have I landed by himself;
    Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
    In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
    His arms in this sad knot.

PROSPERO

    Of the king's ship
    The mariners say how thou hast disposed
    And all the rest o' the fleet.

ARIEL

    Safely in harbour
    Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
    Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
    From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
    The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
    Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
    I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
    Which I dispersed, they all have met again
    And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
    Bound sadly home for Naples,
    Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
    And his great person perish.

PROSPERO

    Ariel, thy charge
    Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
    What is the time o' the day?

ARIEL

    Past the mid season.

PROSPERO

    At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
    Must by us both be spent most preciously.

ARIEL

    Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
    Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
    Which is not yet perform'd me.

PROSPERO

    How now? moody?
    What is't thou canst demand?

ARIEL

    My liberty.

PROSPERO

    Before the time be out? no more!

ARIEL

    I prithee,
    Remember I have done thee worthy service;
    Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
    Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
    To bate me a full year.

PROSPERO

    Dost thou forget
    From what a torment I did free thee?

ARIEL

    No.

PROSPERO

    Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
    Of the salt deep,
    To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
    To do me business in the veins o' the earth
    When it is baked with frost.

ARIEL

    I do not, sir.

PROSPERO

    Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
    The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
    Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?

ARIEL

    No, sir.

PROSPERO

    Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.

ARIEL

    Sir, in Argier.

PROSPERO

    O, was she so? I must
    Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
    Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
    For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
    To enter human hearing, from Argier,
    Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
    They would not take her life. Is not this true?

ARIEL

    Ay, sir.

PROSPERO

    This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
    And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
    As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
    And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
    To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
    Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
    By help of her more potent ministers
    And in her most unmitigable rage,
    Into a cloven pine; within which rift
    Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
    A dozen years; within which space she died
    And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
    As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
    Save for the son that she did litter here,
    A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
    A human shape.

ARIEL

    Yes, Caliban her son.

PROSPERO

    Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
    Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
    What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
    Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
    Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
    To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
    Could not again undo: it was mine art,
    When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
    The pine and let thee out.

ARIEL

    I thank thee, master.

PROSPERO

    If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
    And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
    Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.

ARIEL

    Pardon, master;
    I will be correspondent to command
    And do my spiriting gently.

PROSPERO

    Do so, and after two days
    I will discharge thee.

ARIEL

    That's my noble master!
    What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?

PROSPERO

    Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
    To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
    To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
    And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!

    Exit ARIEL
    Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!

MIRANDA

    The strangeness of your story put
    Heaviness in me.

PROSPERO

    Shake it off. Come on;
    We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
    Yields us kind answer.

MIRANDA

    'Tis a villain, sir,
    I do not love to look on.

PROSPERO

    But, as 'tis,
    We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
    Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
    That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
    Thou earth, thou! speak.

CALIBAN

    [Within] There's wood enough within.

PROSPERO

    Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
    Come, thou tortoise! when?

    Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph
    Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
    Hark in thine ear.

ARIEL

    My lord it shall be done.

    Exit

PROSPERO

    Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
    Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!

    Enter CALIBAN

CALIBAN

    As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
    With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
    Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
    And blister you all o'er!

PROSPERO

    For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
    Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
    Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
    All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
    As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
    Than bees that made 'em.

CALIBAN

    I must eat my dinner.
    This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
    Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
    Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
    Water with berries in't, and teach me how
    To name the bigger light, and how the less,
    That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
    And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
    The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
    Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
    Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
    For I am all the subjects that you have,
    Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
    In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
    The rest o' the island.

PROSPERO

    Thou most lying slave,
    Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
    Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
    In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
    The honour of my child.

CALIBAN

    O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
    Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
    This isle with Calibans.

PROSPERO

    Abhorred slave,
    Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
    Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
    Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
    One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
    Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
    A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
    With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
    Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
    good natures
    Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
    Deservedly confined into this rock,
    Who hadst deserved more than a prison.

CALIBAN

    You taught me language; and my profit on't
    Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
    For learning me your language!

PROSPERO

    Hag-seed, hence!
    Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
    To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
    If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
    What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
    Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
    That beasts shall tremble at thy din.

CALIBAN

    No, pray thee.

    Aside
    I must obey: his art is of such power,
    It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
    and make a vassal of him.

PROSPERO

    So, slave; hence!

    Exit CALIBAN

    Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing; FERDINAND following
    ARIEL'S song.
    Come unto these yellow sands,
    And then take hands:
    Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
    The wild waves whist,
    Foot it featly here and there;
    And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
    Hark, hark!

    Burthen [dispersedly, within
    The watch-dogs bark!

    Burthen Bow-wow
    Hark, hark! I hear
    The strain of strutting chanticleer
    Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.

FERDINAND

    Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
    It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
    Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
    Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
    This music crept by me upon the waters,
    Allaying both their fury and my passion
    With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
    Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
    No, it begins again.

    ARIEL sings
    Full fathom five thy father lies;
    Of his bones are coral made;
    Those are pearls that were his eyes:
    Nothing of him that doth fade
    But doth suffer a sea-change
    Into something rich and strange.
    Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell

    Burthen Ding-dong
    Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.

FERDINAND

    The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
    This is no mortal business, nor no sound
    That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.

PROSPERO

    The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
    And say what thou seest yond.

MIRANDA

    What is't? a spirit?
    Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
    It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.

PROSPERO

    No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
    As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
    Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
    With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
    A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
    And strays about to find 'em.

MIRANDA

    I might call him
    A thing divine, for nothing natural
    I ever saw so noble.

PROSPERO

    [Aside] It goes on, I see,
    As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
    Within two days for this.

FERDINAND

    Most sure, the goddess
    On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
    May know if you remain upon this island;
    And that you will some good instruction give
    How I may bear me here: my prime request,
    Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
    If you be maid or no?

MIRANDA

    No wonder, sir;
    But certainly a maid.

FERDINAND

    My language! heavens!
    I am the best of them that speak this speech,
    Were I but where 'tis spoken.

PROSPERO

    How? the best?
    What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?

FERDINAND

    A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
    To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
    And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
    Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
    The king my father wreck'd.

MIRANDA

    Alack, for mercy!

FERDINAND

    Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
    And his brave son being twain.

PROSPERO

    [Aside] The Duke of Milan
    And his more braver daughter could control thee,
    If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
    They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
    I'll set thee free for this.

    To FERDINAND
    A word, good sir;
    I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.

MIRANDA

    Why speaks my father so ungently? This
    Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
    That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
    To be inclined my way!

FERDINAND

    O, if a virgin,
    And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
    The queen of Naples.

PROSPERO

    Soft, sir! one word more.

    Aside
    They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
    I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
    Make the prize light.

    To FERDINAND
    One word more; I charge thee
    That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
    The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
    Upon this island as a spy, to win it
    From me, the lord on't.

FERDINAND

    No, as I am a man.

MIRANDA

    There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
    If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
    Good things will strive to dwell with't.

PROSPERO

    Follow me.
    Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
    I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
    Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
    The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
    Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.

FERDINAND

    No;
    I will resist such entertainment till
    Mine enemy has more power.

    Draws, and is charmed from moving

MIRANDA

    O dear father,
    Make not too rash a trial of him, for
    He's gentle and not fearful.

PROSPERO

    What? I say,
    My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
    Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
    Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
    For I can here disarm thee with this stick
    And make thy weapon drop.

MIRANDA

    Beseech you, father.

PROSPERO

    Hence! hang not on my garments.

MIRANDA

    Sir, have pity;
    I'll be his surety.

PROSPERO

    Silence! one word more
    Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
    An advocate for an imposter! hush!
    Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
    Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
    To the most of men this is a Caliban
    And they to him are angels.

MIRANDA

    My affections
    Are then most humble; I have no ambition
    To see a goodlier man.

PROSPERO

    Come on; obey:
    Thy nerves are in their infancy again
    And have no vigour in them.

FERDINAND

    So they are;
    My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
    My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
    The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
    To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
    Might I but through my prison once a day
    Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
    Let liberty make use of; space enough
    Have I in such a prison.

PROSPERO

    [Aside] It works.

    To FERDINAND
    Come on.
    Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!

    To FERDINAND
    Follow me.

    To ARIEL
    Hark what thou else shalt do me.

MIRANDA

    Be of comfort;
    My father's of a better nature, sir,
    Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
    Which now came from him.

PROSPERO

    Thou shalt be free
    As mountain winds: but then exactly do
    All points of my command.

ARIEL

    To the syllable.

PROSPERO

    Come, follow. Speak not for him.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Another part of the island.

    Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others

GONZALO

    Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
    So have we all, of joy; for our escape
    Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
    Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
    The masters of some merchant and the merchant
    Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
    I mean our preservation, few in millions
    Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
    Our sorrow with our comfort.

ALONSO

    Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN

    He receives comfort like cold porridge.

ANTONIO

    The visitor will not give him o'er so.

SEBASTIAN

    Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
    by and by it will strike.

GONZALO

    Sir,--

SEBASTIAN

    One: tell.

GONZALO

    When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
    Comes to the entertainer--

SEBASTIAN

    A dollar.

GONZALO

    Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
    have spoken truer than you purposed.

SEBASTIAN

    You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.

GONZALO

    Therefore, my lord,--

ANTONIO

    Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!

ALONSO

    I prithee, spare.

GONZALO

    Well, I have done: but yet,--

SEBASTIAN

    He will be talking.

ANTONIO

    Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
    wager, first begins to crow?

SEBASTIAN

    The old cock.

ANTONIO

    The cockerel.

SEBASTIAN

    Done. The wager?

ANTONIO

    A laughter.

SEBASTIAN

    A match!

ADRIAN

    Though this island seem to be desert,--

SEBASTIAN

    Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.

ADRIAN

    Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--

SEBASTIAN

    Yet,--

ADRIAN

    Yet,--

ANTONIO

    He could not miss't.

ADRIAN

    It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
    temperance.

ANTONIO

    Temperance was a delicate wench.

SEBASTIAN

    Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.

ADRIAN

    The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.

SEBASTIAN

    As if it had lungs and rotten ones.

ANTONIO

    Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.

GONZALO

    Here is everything advantageous to life.

ANTONIO

    True; save means to live.

SEBASTIAN

    Of that there's none, or little.

GONZALO

    How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!

ANTONIO

    The ground indeed is tawny.

SEBASTIAN

    With an eye of green in't.

ANTONIO

    He misses not much.

SEBASTIAN

    No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.

GONZALO

    But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
    beyond credit,--

SEBASTIAN

    As many vouched rarities are.

GONZALO

    That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
    the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
    glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
    salt water.

ANTONIO

    If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
    say he lies?

SEBASTIAN

    Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report

GONZALO

    Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
    put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
    the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.

SEBASTIAN

    'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.

ADRIAN

    Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
    their queen.

GONZALO

    Not since widow Dido's time.

ANTONIO

    Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
    widow Dido!

SEBASTIAN

    What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
    how you take it!

ADRIAN

    'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
    she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.

GONZALO

    This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.

ADRIAN

    Carthage?

GONZALO

    I assure you, Carthage.

SEBASTIAN

    His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
    raised the wall and houses too.

ANTONIO

    What impossible matter will he make easy next?

SEBASTIAN

    I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
    and give it his son for an apple.

ANTONIO

    And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
    forth more islands.

GONZALO

    Ay.

ANTONIO

    Why, in good time.

GONZALO

    Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
    as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
    of your daughter, who is now queen.

ANTONIO

    And the rarest that e'er came there.

SEBASTIAN

    Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.

ANTONIO

    O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.

GONZALO

    Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
    wore it? I mean, in a sort.

ANTONIO

    That sort was well fished for.

GONZALO

    When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?

ALONSO

    You cram these words into mine ears against
    The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
    Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
    My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
    Who is so far from Italy removed
    I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
    Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
    Hath made his meal on thee?

FRANCISCO

    Sir, he may live:
    I saw him beat the surges under him,
    And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
    Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
    The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
    'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
    Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
    To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
    As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
    He came alive to land.

ALONSO

    No, no, he's gone.

SEBASTIAN

    Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
    That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
    But rather lose her to an African;
    Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
    Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.

ALONSO

    Prithee, peace.

SEBASTIAN

    You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
    By all of us, and the fair soul herself
    Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
    Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
    son,
    I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
    More widows in them of this business' making
    Than we bring men to comfort them:
    The fault's your own.

ALONSO

    So is the dear'st o' the loss.

GONZALO

    My lord Sebastian,
    The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
    And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
    When you should bring the plaster.

SEBASTIAN

    Very well.

ANTONIO

    And most chirurgeonly.

GONZALO

    It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
    When you are cloudy.

SEBASTIAN

    Foul weather?

ANTONIO

    Very foul.

GONZALO

    Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--

ANTONIO

    He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.

SEBASTIAN

    Or docks, or mallows.

GONZALO

    And were the king on't, what would I do?

SEBASTIAN

    'Scape being drunk for want of wine.

GONZALO

    I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
    Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
    Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
    Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
    And use of service, none; contract, succession,
    Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
    No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
    No occupation; all men idle, all;
    And women too, but innocent and pure;
    No sovereignty;--

SEBASTIAN

    Yet he would be king on't.

ANTONIO

    The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
    beginning.

GONZALO

    All things in common nature should produce
    Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
    Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
    Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
    Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
    To feed my innocent people.

SEBASTIAN

    No marrying 'mong his subjects?

ANTONIO

    None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.

GONZALO

    I would with such perfection govern, sir,
    To excel the golden age.

SEBASTIAN

    God save his majesty!

ANTONIO

    Long live Gonzalo!

GONZALO

    And,--do you mark me, sir?

ALONSO

    Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.

GONZALO

    I do well believe your highness; and
    did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
    who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
    they always use to laugh at nothing.

ANTONIO

    'Twas you we laughed at.

GONZALO

    Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
    to you: so you may continue and laugh at
    nothing still.

ANTONIO

    What a blow was there given!

SEBASTIAN

    An it had not fallen flat-long.

GONZALO

    You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
    the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
    in it five weeks without changing.

    Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music

SEBASTIAN

    We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.

ANTONIO

    Nay, good my lord, be not angry.

GONZALO

    No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
    my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
    me asleep, for I am very heavy?

ANTONIO

    Go sleep, and hear us.

    All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO

ALONSO

    What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
    Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
    They are inclined to do so.

SEBASTIAN

    Please you, sir,
    Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
    It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
    It is a comforter.

ANTONIO

    We two, my lord,
    Will guard your person while you take your rest,
    And watch your safety.

ALONSO

    Thank you. Wondrous heavy.

    ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL

SEBASTIAN

    What a strange drowsiness possesses them!

ANTONIO

    It is the quality o' the climate.

SEBASTIAN

    Why
    Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
    Myself disposed to sleep.

ANTONIO

    Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
    They fell together all, as by consent;
    They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
    Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
    And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
    What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
    My strong imagination sees a crown
    Dropping upon thy head.

SEBASTIAN

    What, art thou waking?

ANTONIO

    Do you not hear me speak?

SEBASTIAN

    I do; and surely
    It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
    Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
    This is a strange repose, to be asleep
    With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
    And yet so fast asleep.

ANTONIO

    Noble Sebastian,
    Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
    Whiles thou art waking.

SEBASTIAN

    Thou dost snore distinctly;
    There's meaning in thy snores.

ANTONIO

    I am more serious than my custom: you
    Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
    Trebles thee o'er.

SEBASTIAN

    Well, I am standing water.

ANTONIO

    I'll teach you how to flow.

SEBASTIAN

    Do so: to ebb
    Hereditary sloth instructs me.

ANTONIO

    O,
    If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
    Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
    You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
    Most often do so near the bottom run
    By their own fear or sloth.

SEBASTIAN

    Prithee, say on:
    The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
    A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
    Which throes thee much to yield.

ANTONIO

    Thus, sir:
    Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
    Who shall be of as little memory
    When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
    For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
    Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
    'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
    And he that sleeps here swims.

SEBASTIAN

    I have no hope
    That he's undrown'd.

ANTONIO

    O, out of that 'no hope'
    What great hope have you! no hope that way is
    Another way so high a hope that even
    Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
    But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
    That Ferdinand is drown'd?

SEBASTIAN

    He's gone.

ANTONIO

    Then, tell me,
    Who's the next heir of Naples?

SEBASTIAN

    Claribel.

ANTONIO

    She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
    Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
    Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
    The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
    Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
    We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
    And by that destiny to perform an act
    Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
    In yours and my discharge.

SEBASTIAN

    What stuff is this! how say you?
    'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
    So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
    There is some space.

ANTONIO

    A space whose every cubit
    Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
    Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
    And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
    That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
    Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
    As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
    As amply and unnecessarily
    As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
    A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
    The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
    For your advancement! Do you understand me?

SEBASTIAN

    Methinks I do.

ANTONIO

    And how does your content
    Tender your own good fortune?

SEBASTIAN

    I remember
    You did supplant your brother Prospero.

ANTONIO

    True:
    And look how well my garments sit upon me;
    Much feater than before: my brother's servants
    Were then my fellows; now they are my men.

SEBASTIAN

    But, for your conscience?

ANTONIO

    Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
    'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
    This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
    That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
    And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
    No better than the earth he lies upon,
    If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
    Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
    Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
    To the perpetual wink for aye might put
    This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
    Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
    They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
    They'll tell the clock to any business that
    We say befits the hour.

SEBASTIAN

    Thy case, dear friend,
    Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
    I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
    Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
    And I the king shall love thee.

ANTONIO

    Draw together;
    And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
    To fall it on Gonzalo.

SEBASTIAN

    O, but one word.

    They talk apart

    Re-enter ARIEL, invisible

ARIEL

    My master through his art foresees the danger
    That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--
    For else his project dies--to keep them living.

    Sings in GONZALO's ear
    While you here do snoring lie,
    Open-eyed conspiracy
    His time doth take.
    If of life you keep a care,
    Shake off slumber, and beware:
    Awake, awake!

ANTONIO

    Then let us both be sudden.

GONZALO

    Now, good angels
    Preserve the king.

    They wake

ALONSO

    Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
    Wherefore this ghastly looking?

GONZALO

    What's the matter?

SEBASTIAN

    Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
    Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
    Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?
    It struck mine ear most terribly.

ALONSO

    I heard nothing.

ANTONIO

    O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
    To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
    Of a whole herd of lions.

ALONSO

    Heard you this, Gonzalo?

GONZALO

    Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
    And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
    I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
    I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
    That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
    Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.

ALONSO

    Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
    For my poor son.

GONZALO

    Heavens keep him from these beasts!
    For he is, sure, i' the island.

ALONSO

    Lead away.

ARIEL

    Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
    So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Another part of the island.

    Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of thunder heard

CALIBAN

    All the infections that the sun sucks up
    From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
    By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
    And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
    Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,
    Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
    Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
    For every trifle are they set upon me;
    Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
    And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
    Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
    Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
    All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
    Do hiss me into madness.

    Enter TRINCULO
    Lo, now, lo!
    Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
    For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
    Perchance he will not mind me.

TRINCULO

    Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off
    any weather at all, and another storm brewing;
    I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
    cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul
    bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
    should thunder as it did before, I know not
    where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
    choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
    here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
    he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-
    like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-
    John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
    as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
    not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
    of silver: there would this monster make a
    man; any strange beast there makes a man:
    when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
    beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
    Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
    arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
    my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,
    but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
    thunderbolt.

    Thunder
    Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to
    creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
    shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
    strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
    dregs of the storm be past.

    Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand

STEPHANO

    I shall no more to sea, to sea,
    Here shall I die ashore--
    This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
    funeral: well, here's my comfort.

    Drinks

    Sings
    The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,
    The gunner and his mate
    Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,
    But none of us cared for Kate;
    For she had a tongue with a tang,
    Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!
    She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,
    Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:
    Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
    This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.

    Drinks

CALIBAN

    Do not torment me: Oh!

STEPHANO

    What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put
    tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
    have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
    four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as
    ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;
    and it shall be said so again while Stephano
    breathes at's nostrils.

CALIBAN

    The spirit torments me; Oh!

STEPHANO

    This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
    hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
    should he learn our language? I will give him some
    relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
    and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a
    present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.

CALIBAN

    Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.

STEPHANO

    He's in his fit now and does not talk after the
    wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
    never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
    fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will
    not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that
    hath him, and that soundly.

CALIBAN

    Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I
    know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.

STEPHANO

    Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
    which will give language to you, cat: open your
    mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,
    and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:
    open your chaps again.

TRINCULO

    I should know that voice: it should be--but he is
    drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!

STEPHANO

    Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!
    His forward voice now is to speak well of his
    friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches
    and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
    recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I
    will pour some in thy other mouth.

TRINCULO

    Stephano!

STEPHANO

    Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is
    a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no
    long spoon.

TRINCULO

    Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and
    speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy
    good friend Trinculo.

STEPHANO

    If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee
    by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,
    these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How
    camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
    he vent Trinculos?

TRINCULO

    I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But
    art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art
    not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
    under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of
    the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O
    Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!

STEPHANO

    Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.

CALIBAN

    [Aside] These be fine things, an if they be
    not sprites.
    That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
    I will kneel to him.

STEPHANO

    How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
    swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
    escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
    heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of
    the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
    cast ashore.

CALIBAN

    I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;
    for the liquor is not earthly.

STEPHANO

    Here; swear then how thou escapedst.

TRINCULO

    Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a
    duck, I'll be sworn.

STEPHANO

    Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a
    duck, thou art made like a goose.

TRINCULO

    O Stephano. hast any more of this?

STEPHANO

    The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the
    sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!
    how does thine ague?

CALIBAN

    Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?

STEPHANO

    Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'
    the moon when time was.

CALIBAN

    I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
    My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.

STEPHANO

    Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish
    it anon with new contents swear.

TRINCULO

    By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!
    I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'
    the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
    drawn, monster, in good sooth!

CALIBAN

    I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
    And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.

TRINCULO

    By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
    monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.

CALIBAN

    I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.

STEPHANO

    Come on then; down, and swear.

TRINCULO

    I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
    monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my
    heart to beat him,--

STEPHANO

    Come, kiss.

TRINCULO

    But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!

CALIBAN

    I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
    I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
    A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
    I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
    Thou wondrous man.

TRINCULO

    A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a
    Poor drunkard!

CALIBAN

    I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
    And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;
    Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
    To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
    To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
    Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?

STEPHANO

    I prithee now, lead the way without any more
    talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company
    else being drowned, we will inherit here: here;
    bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by
    and by again.

CALIBAN

    [Sings drunkenly]
    Farewell master; farewell, farewell!

TRINCULO

    A howling monster: a drunken monster!

CALIBAN

    No more dams I'll make for fish
    Nor fetch in firing
    At requiring;
    Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish
    'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban
    Has a new master: get a new man.
    Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,
    hey-day, freedom!

STEPHANO

    O brave monster! Lead the way.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S Cell.

    Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log

FERDINAND

    There be some sports are painful, and their labour
    Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
    Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
    Point to rich ends. This my mean task
    Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
    The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
    And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
    Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
    And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
    Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
    Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
    Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
    Had never like executor. I forget:
    But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
    Most busy lest, when I do it.

    Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen

MIRANDA

    Alas, now, pray you,
    Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
    Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
    Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
    'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
    Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;
    He's safe for these three hours.

FERDINAND

    O most dear mistress,
    The sun will set before I shall discharge
    What I must strive to do.

MIRANDA

    If you'll sit down,
    I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
    I'll carry it to the pile.

FERDINAND

    No, precious creature;
    I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
    Than you should such dishonour undergo,
    While I sit lazy by.

MIRANDA

    It would become me
    As well as it does you: and I should do it
    With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
    And yours it is against.

PROSPERO

    Poor worm, thou art infected!
    This visitation shows it.

MIRANDA

    You look wearily.

FERDINAND

    No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me
    When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
    Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
    What is your name?

MIRANDA

    Miranda.--O my father,
    I have broke your hest to say so!

FERDINAND

    Admired Miranda!
    Indeed the top of admiration! worth
    What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
    I have eyed with best regard and many a time
    The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
    Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
    Have I liked several women; never any
    With so fun soul, but some defect in her
    Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
    And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
    So perfect and so peerless, are created
    Of every creature's best!

MIRANDA

    I do not know
    One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
    Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
    More that I may call men than you, good friend,
    And my dear father: how features are abroad,
    I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
    The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
    Any companion in the world but you,
    Nor can imagination form a shape,
    Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
    Something too wildly and my father's precepts
    I therein do forget.

FERDINAND

    I am in my condition
    A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;
    I would, not so!--and would no more endure
    This wooden slavery than to suffer
    The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
    The very instant that I saw you, did
    My heart fly to your service; there resides,
    To make me slave to it; and for your sake
    Am I this patient log--man.

MIRANDA

    Do you love me?

FERDINAND

    O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
    And crown what I profess with kind event
    If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
    What best is boded me to mischief! I
    Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
    Do love, prize, honour you.

MIRANDA

    I am a fool
    To weep at what I am glad of.

PROSPERO

    Fair encounter
    Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
    On that which breeds between 'em!

FERDINAND

    Wherefore weep you?

MIRANDA

    At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
    What I desire to give, and much less take
    What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
    And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
    The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
    And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
    I am your wife, if you will marry me;
    If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
    You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
    Whether you will or no.

FERDINAND

    My mistress, dearest;
    And I thus humble ever.

MIRANDA

    My husband, then?

FERDINAND

    Ay, with a heart as willing
    As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.

MIRANDA

    And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell
    Till half an hour hence.

FERDINAND

    A thousand thousand!

    Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally

PROSPERO

    So glad of this as they I cannot be,
    Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing
    At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,
    For yet ere supper-time must I perform
    Much business appertaining.

    Exit

SCENE II. Another part of the island.

    Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO

STEPHANO

    Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink
    water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and
    board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.

TRINCULO

    Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
    say there's but five upon this isle: we are three
    of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the
    state totters.

STEPHANO

    Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes
    are almost set in thy head.

TRINCULO

    Where should they be set else? he were a brave
    monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.

STEPHANO

    My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
    for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I
    could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off
    and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
    monster, or my standard.

TRINCULO

    Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.

STEPHANO

    We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.

TRINCULO

    Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say
    nothing neither.

STEPHANO

    Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a
    good moon-calf.

CALIBAN

    How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
    I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.

TRINCULO

    Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to
    justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,
    was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
    sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,
    being but half a fish and half a monster?

CALIBAN

    Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?

TRINCULO

    'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!

CALIBAN

    Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.

STEPHANO

    Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you
    prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's
    my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.

CALIBAN

    I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
    hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?

STEPHANO

    Marry, will I kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
    and so shall Trinculo.

    Enter ARIEL, invisible

CALIBAN

    As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a
    sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.

ARIEL

    Thou liest.

CALIBAN

    Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my
    valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.

STEPHANO

    Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by
    this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.

TRINCULO

    Why, I said nothing.

STEPHANO

    Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.

CALIBAN

    I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
    From me he got it. if thy greatness will
    Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
    But this thing dare not,--

STEPHANO

    That's most certain.

CALIBAN

    Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.

STEPHANO

    How now shall this be compassed?
    Canst thou bring me to the party?

CALIBAN

    Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
    Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.

ARIEL

    Thou liest; thou canst not.

CALIBAN

    What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
    I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
    And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
    He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
    Where the quick freshes are.

STEPHANO

    Trinculo, run into no further danger:
    interrupt the monster one word further, and,
    by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors
    and make a stock-fish of thee.

TRINCULO

    Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
    off.

STEPHANO

    Didst thou not say he lied?

ARIEL

    Thou liest.

STEPHANO

    Do I so? take thou that.

    Beats TRINCULO
    As you like this, give me the lie another time.

TRINCULO

    I did not give the lie. Out o' your
    wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
    this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
    your monster, and the devil take your fingers!

CALIBAN

    Ha, ha, ha!

STEPHANO

    Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther
    off.

CALIBAN

    Beat him enough: after a little time
    I'll beat him too.

STEPHANO

    Stand farther. Come, proceed.

CALIBAN

    Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
    I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
    Having first seized his books, or with a log
    Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
    Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
    First to possess his books; for without them
    He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
    One spirit to command: they all do hate him
    As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
    He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--
    Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal
    And that most deeply to consider is
    The beauty of his daughter; he himself
    Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
    But only Sycorax my dam and she;
    But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
    As great'st does least.

STEPHANO

    Is it so brave a lass?

CALIBAN

    Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
    And bring thee forth brave brood.

STEPHANO

    Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I
    will be king and queen--save our graces!--and
    Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
    like the plot, Trinculo?

TRINCULO

    Excellent.

STEPHANO

    Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,
    while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.

CALIBAN

    Within this half hour will he be asleep:
    Wilt thou destroy him then?

STEPHANO

    Ay, on mine honour.

ARIEL

    This will I tell my master.

CALIBAN

    Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
    Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
    You taught me but while-ere?

STEPHANO

    At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
    reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.

    Sings
    Flout 'em and scout 'em
    And scout 'em and flout 'em
    Thought is free.

CALIBAN

    That's not the tune.

    Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe

STEPHANO

    What is this same?

TRINCULO

    This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture
    of Nobody.

STEPHANO

    If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:
    if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.

TRINCULO

    O, forgive me my sins!

STEPHANO

    He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!

CALIBAN

    Art thou afeard?

STEPHANO

    No, monster, not I.

CALIBAN

    Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
    Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
    Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
    Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
    That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
    Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
    The clouds methought would open and show riches
    Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,
    I cried to dream again.

STEPHANO

    This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall
    have my music for nothing.

CALIBAN

    When Prospero is destroyed.

STEPHANO

    That shall be by and by: I remember the story.

TRINCULO

    The sound is going away; let's follow it, and
    after do our work.

STEPHANO

    Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see
    this tabourer; he lays it on.

TRINCULO

    Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Another part of the island.

    Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO, ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others

GONZALO

    By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
    My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
    Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
    I needs must rest me.

ALONSO

    Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
    Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
    To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
    Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
    No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
    Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
    Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.

ANTONIO

    [Aside to SEBASTIAN] I am right glad that he's so
    out of hope.
    Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
    That you resolved to effect.

SEBASTIAN

    [Aside to ANTONIO] The next advantage
    Will we take throughly.

ANTONIO

    [Aside to SEBASTIAN] Let it be to-night;
    For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
    Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
    As when they are fresh.

SEBASTIAN

    [Aside to ANTONIO] I say, to-night: no more.

    Solemn and strange music

ALONSO

    What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!

GONZALO

    Marvellous sweet music!

    Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet; they dance about it with gentle actions of salutation; and, inviting the King, & c. to eat, they depart

ALONSO

    Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?

SEBASTIAN

    A living drollery. Now I will believe
    That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
    There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
    At this hour reigning there.

ANTONIO

    I'll believe both;
    And what does else want credit, come to me,
    And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
    lie,
    Though fools at home condemn 'em.

GONZALO

    If in Naples
    I should report this now, would they believe me?
    If I should say, I saw such islanders--
    For, certes, these are people of the island--
    Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
    Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
    Our human generation you shall find
    Many, nay, almost any.

PROSPERO

    [Aside] Honest lord,
    Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
    Are worse than devils.

ALONSO

    I cannot too much muse
    Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
    Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
    Of excellent dumb discourse.

PROSPERO

    [Aside] Praise in departing.

FRANCISCO

    They vanish'd strangely.

SEBASTIAN

    No matter, since
    They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
    Will't please you taste of what is here?

ALONSO

    Not I.

GONZALO

    Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
    Who would believe that there were mountaineers
    Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
    Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
    Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
    Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
    Good warrant of.

ALONSO

    I will stand to and feed,
    Although my last: no matter, since I feel
    The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
    Stand to and do as we.

    Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and, with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes

ARIEL

    You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
    That hath to instrument this lower world
    And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
    Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
    Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
    Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
    And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
    Their proper selves.

    ALONSO, SEBASTIAN & c. draw their swords
    You fools! I and my fellows
    Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
    Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
    Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
    Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
    One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
    Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
    Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
    And will not be uplifted. But remember--
    For that's my business to you--that you three
    From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
    Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
    Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
    The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
    Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
    Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
    They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
    Lingering perdition, worse than any death
    Can be at once, shall step by step attend
    You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
    Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
    Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
    And a clear life ensuing.

    He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music enter the Shapes again, and dance, with mocks and mows, and carrying out the table

PROSPERO

    Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
    Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
    Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
    In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
    And observation strange, my meaner ministers
    Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
    And these mine enemies are all knit up
    In their distractions; they now are in my power;
    And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
    Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
    And his and mine loved darling.

    Exit above

GONZALO

    I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
    In this strange stare?

ALONSO

    O, it is monstrous, monstrous:
    Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
    The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
    That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
    The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
    Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
    I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
    And with him there lie mudded.

    Exit

SEBASTIAN

    But one fiend at a time,
    I'll fight their legions o'er.

ANTONIO

    I'll be thy second.

    Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO

GONZALO

    All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
    Like poison given to work a great time after,
    Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
    That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
    And hinder them from what this ecstasy
    May now provoke them to.

ADRIAN

    Follow, I pray you.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.

    Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA

PROSPERO

    If I have too austerely punish'd you,
    Your compensation makes amends, for I
    Have given you here a third of mine own life,
    Or that for which I live; who once again
    I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
    Were but my trials of thy love and thou
    Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,
    I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
    Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
    For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
    And make it halt behind her.

FERDINAND

    I do believe it
    Against an oracle.

PROSPERO

    Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
    Worthily purchased take my daughter: but
    If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
    All sanctimonious ceremonies may
    With full and holy rite be minister'd,
    No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
    To make this contract grow: but barren hate,
    Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
    The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
    That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
    As Hymen's lamps shall light you.

FERDINAND

    As I hope
    For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
    With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
    The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.
    Our worser genius can, shall never melt
    Mine honour into lust, to take away
    The edge of that day's celebration
    When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
    Or Night kept chain'd below.

PROSPERO

    Fairly spoke.
    Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
    What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!

    Enter ARIEL

ARIEL

    What would my potent master? here I am.

PROSPERO

    Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
    Did worthily perform; and I must use you
    In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
    O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
    Incite them to quick motion; for I must
    Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
    Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
    And they expect it from me.

ARIEL

    Presently?

PROSPERO

    Ay, with a twink.

ARIEL

    Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
    And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
    Each one, tripping on his toe,
    Will be here with mop and mow.
    Do you love me, master? no?

PROSPERO

    Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
    Till thou dost hear me call.

ARIEL

    Well, I conceive.

    Exit

PROSPERO

    Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
    Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
    To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,
    Or else, good night your vow!

FERDINAND

    I warrant you sir;
    The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
    Abates the ardour of my liver.

PROSPERO

    Well.
    Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,
    Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!
    No tongue! all eyes! be silent.

    Soft music

    Enter IRIS

IRIS

    Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
    Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
    Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
    And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
    Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
    Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
    To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,
    Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
    Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;
    And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
    Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,
    Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
    Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
    Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
    To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
    Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.

    Enter CERES

CERES

    Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
    Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
    Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
    Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,
    And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
    My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
    Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
    Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?

IRIS

    A contract of true love to celebrate;
    And some donation freely to estate
    On the blest lovers.

CERES

    Tell me, heavenly bow,
    If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
    Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
    The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
    Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
    I have forsworn.

IRIS

    Of her society
    Be not afraid: I met her deity
    Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
    Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
    Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
    Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
    Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;
    Mars's hot minion is returned again;
    Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
    Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
    And be a boy right out.

CERES

    High'st queen of state,
    Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.

    Enter JUNO

JUNO

    How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
    To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be
    And honour'd in their issue.

    They sing:

JUNO

    Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
    Long continuance, and increasing,
    Hourly joys be still upon you!
    Juno sings her blessings upon you.

CERES

    Earth's increase, foison plenty,
    Barns and garners never empty,
    Vines and clustering bunches growing,
    Plants with goodly burthen bowing;
    Spring come to you at the farthest
    In the very end of harvest!
    Scarcity and want shall shun you;
    Ceres' blessing so is on you.

FERDINAND

    This is a most majestic vision, and
    Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold
    To think these spirits?

PROSPERO

    Spirits, which by mine art
    I have from their confines call'd to enact
    My present fancies.

FERDINAND

    Let me live here ever;
    So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
    Makes this place Paradise.

    Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on employment

PROSPERO

    Sweet, now, silence!
    Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
    There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,
    Or else our spell is marr'd.

IRIS

    You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,
    With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,
    Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
    Answer your summons; Juno does command:
    Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
    A contract of true love; be not too late.

    Enter certain Nymphs
    You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
    Come hither from the furrow and be merry:
    Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
    And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
    In country footing.

    Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance; towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a strange, hollow, and confused noise, they heavily vanish

PROSPERO

    [Aside] I had forgot that foul conspiracy
    Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
    Against my life: the minute of their plot
    Is almost come.

    To the Spirits
    Well done! avoid; no more!

FERDINAND

    This is strange: your father's in some passion
    That works him strongly.

MIRANDA

    Never till this day
    Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.

PROSPERO

    You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
    As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
    Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
    As I foretold you, were all spirits and
    Are melted into air, into thin air:
    And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
    The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
    The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
    Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
    And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
    Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
    As dreams are made on, and our little life
    Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;
    Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:
    Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
    If you be pleased, retire into my cell
    And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
    To still my beating mind.

FERDINAND MIRANDA

    We wish your peace.

    Exeunt

PROSPERO

    Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.

    Enter ARIEL

ARIEL

    Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?

PROSPERO

    Spirit,
    We must prepare to meet with Caliban.

ARIEL

    Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
    I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd
    Lest I might anger thee.

PROSPERO

    Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?

ARIEL

    I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
    So fun of valour that they smote the air
    For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
    For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
    Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;
    At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd
    their ears,
    Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
    As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
    That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
    Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
    Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them
    I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
    There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
    O'erstunk their feet.

PROSPERO

    This was well done, my bird.
    Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
    The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
    For stale to catch these thieves.

ARIEL

    I go, I go.

    Exit

PROSPERO

    A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
    Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
    Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
    And as with age his body uglier grows,
    So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
    Even to roaring.

    Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, & c
    Come, hang them on this line.

    PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet

CALIBAN

    Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
    Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.

STEPHANO

    Monster, your fairy, which you say is
    a harmless fairy, has done little better than
    played the Jack with us.

TRINCULO

    Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at
    which my nose is in great indignation.

STEPHANO

    So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take
    a displeasure against you, look you,--

TRINCULO

    Thou wert but a lost monster.

CALIBAN

    Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
    Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
    Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
    All's hush'd as midnight yet.

TRINCULO

    Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--

STEPHANO

    There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
    monster, but an infinite loss.

TRINCULO

    That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your
    harmless fairy, monster.

STEPHANO

    I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears
    for my labour.

CALIBAN

    Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
    This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
    Do that good mischief which may make this island
    Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
    For aye thy foot-licker.

STEPHANO

    Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.

TRINCULO

    O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look
    what a wardrobe here is for thee!

CALIBAN

    Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.

TRINCULO

    O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.
    O king Stephano!

STEPHANO

    Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have
    that gown.

TRINCULO

    Thy grace shall have it.

CALIBAN

    The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
    To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
    And do the murder first: if he awake,
    From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
    Make us strange stuff.

STEPHANO

    Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,
    is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
    the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your
    hair and prove a bald jerkin.

TRINCULO

    Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.

STEPHANO

    I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:
    wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
    country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
    pass of pate; there's another garment for't.

TRINCULO

    Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and
    away with the rest.

CALIBAN

    I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
    And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
    With foreheads villanous low.

STEPHANO

    Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this
    away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you
    out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.

TRINCULO

    And this.

STEPHANO

    Ay, and this.

    A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits, in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about, PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on

PROSPERO

    Hey, Mountain, hey!

ARIEL

    Silver I there it goes, Silver!

PROSPERO

    Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!

    CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are driven out
    Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
    With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
    With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
    Than pard or cat o' mountain.

ARIEL

    Hark, they roar!

PROSPERO

    Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
    Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:
    Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
    Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
    Follow, and do me service.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Before PROSPERO'S cell.

    Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL

PROSPERO

    Now does my project gather to a head:
    My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
    Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?

ARIEL

    On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
    You said our work should cease.

PROSPERO

    I did say so,
    When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
    How fares the king and's followers?

ARIEL

    Confined together
    In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
    Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
    In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
    They cannot budge till your release. The king,
    His brother and yours, abide all three distracted
    And the remainder mourning over them,
    Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
    Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'
    His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
    From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
    That if you now beheld them, your affections
    Would become tender.

PROSPERO

    Dost thou think so, spirit?

ARIEL

    Mine would, sir, were I human.

PROSPERO

    And mine shall.
    Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
    Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
    One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
    Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
    Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
    Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury
    Do I take part: the rarer action is
    In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
    The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
    Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:
    My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
    And they shall be themselves.

ARIEL

    I'll fetch them, sir.

    Exit

PROSPERO

    Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
    And ye that on the sands with printless foot
    Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
    When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
    By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
    Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
    Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
    To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
    Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
    The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
    And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
    Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
    Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
    With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
    Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
    The pine and cedar: graves at my command
    Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth
    By my so potent art. But this rough magic
    I here abjure, and, when I have required
    Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
    To work mine end upon their senses that
    This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
    Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
    And deeper than did ever plummet sound
    I'll drown my book.

    Solemn music

    Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO; SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner, attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO they all enter the circle which PROSPERO had made, and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO observing, speaks:
    A solemn air and the best comforter
    To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
    Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
    For you are spell-stopp'd.
    Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
    Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
    Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
    And as the morning steals upon the night,
    Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
    Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
    Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
    My true preserver, and a loyal sir
    To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
    Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
    Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
    Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
    Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
    You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
    Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,
    Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
    Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,
    Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
    Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
    Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
    That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
    That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,
    Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
    I will discase me, and myself present
    As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
    Thou shalt ere long be free.

    ARIEL sings and helps to attire him
    Where the bee sucks. there suck I:
    In a cowslip's bell I lie;
    There I couch when owls do cry.
    On the bat's back I do fly
    After summer merrily.
    Merrily, merrily shall I live now
    Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.

PROSPERO

    Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:
    But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
    To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:
    There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
    Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
    Being awake, enforce them to this place,
    And presently, I prithee.

ARIEL

    I drink the air before me, and return
    Or ere your pulse twice beat.

    Exit

GONZALO

    All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
    Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
    Out of this fearful country!

PROSPERO

    Behold, sir king,
    The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
    For more assurance that a living prince
    Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
    And to thee and thy company I bid
    A hearty welcome.

ALONSO

    Whether thou best he or no,
    Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
    As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
    Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
    The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
    I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
    An if this be at all, a most strange story.
    Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
    Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
    Be living and be here?

PROSPERO

    First, noble friend,
    Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
    Be measured or confined.

GONZALO

    Whether this be
    Or be not, I'll not swear.

PROSPERO

    You do yet taste
    Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you
    Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!

    Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO
    But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
    I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
    And justify you traitors: at this time
    I will tell no tales.

SEBASTIAN

    [Aside] The devil speaks in him.

PROSPERO

    No.
    For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
    Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
    Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
    My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
    Thou must restore.

ALONSO

    If thou be'st Prospero,
    Give us particulars of thy preservation;
    How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
    Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
    How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
    My dear son Ferdinand.

PROSPERO

    I am woe for't, sir.

ALONSO

    Irreparable is the loss, and patience
    Says it is past her cure.

PROSPERO

    I rather think
    You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
    For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
    And rest myself content.

ALONSO

    You the like loss!

PROSPERO

    As great to me as late; and, supportable
    To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
    Than you may call to comfort you, for I
    Have lost my daughter.

ALONSO

    A daughter?
    O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
    The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
    Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
    Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?

PROSPERO

    In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
    At this encounter do so much admire
    That they devour their reason and scarce think
    Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
    Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
    Been justled from your senses, know for certain
    That I am Prospero and that very duke
    Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
    Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
    To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;
    For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
    Not a relation for a breakfast nor
    Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
    This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
    And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
    My dukedom since you have given me again,
    I will requite you with as good a thing;
    At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
    As much as me my dukedom.

    Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA playing at chess

MIRANDA

    Sweet lord, you play me false.

FERDINAND

    No, my dear'st love,
    I would not for the world.

MIRANDA

    Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
    And I would call it, fair play.

ALONSO

    If this prove
    A vision of the Island, one dear son
    Shall I twice lose.

SEBASTIAN

    A most high miracle!

FERDINAND

    Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
    I have cursed them without cause.

    Kneels

ALONSO

    Now all the blessings
    Of a glad father compass thee about!
    Arise, and say how thou camest here.

MIRANDA

    O, wonder!
    How many goodly creatures are there here!
    How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
    That has such people in't!

PROSPERO

    'Tis new to thee.

ALONSO

    What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
    Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
    Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
    And brought us thus together?

FERDINAND

    Sir, she is mortal;
    But by immortal Providence she's mine:
    I chose her when I could not ask my father
    For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
    Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
    Of whom so often I have heard renown,
    But never saw before; of whom I have
    Received a second life; and second father
    This lady makes him to me.

ALONSO

    I am hers:
    But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
    Must ask my child forgiveness!

PROSPERO

    There, sir, stop:
    Let us not burthen our remembrance with
    A heaviness that's gone.

GONZALO

    I have inly wept,
    Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,
    And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
    For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
    Which brought us hither.

ALONSO

    I say, Amen, Gonzalo!

GONZALO

    Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
    Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
    Beyond a common joy, and set it down
    With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
    Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
    And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
    Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
    In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
    When no man was his own.

ALONSO

    [To FERDINAND and MIRANDA] Give me your hands:
    Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
    That doth not wish you joy!

GONZALO

    Be it so! Amen!

    Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain amazedly following
    O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
    I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
    This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
    That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
    Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?

Boatswain

    The best news is, that we have safely found
    Our king and company; the next, our ship--
    Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
    Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
    We first put out to sea.

ARIEL

    [Aside to PROSPERO] Sir, all this service
    Have I done since I went.

PROSPERO

    [Aside to ARIEL] My tricksy spirit!

ALONSO

    These are not natural events; they strengthen
    From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?

Boatswain

    If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
    I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
    And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;
    Where but even now with strange and several noises
    Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
    And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
    We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
    Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
    Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
    Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
    Even in a dream, were we divided from them
    And were brought moping hither.

ARIEL

    [Aside to PROSPERO] Was't well done?

PROSPERO

    [Aside to ARIEL] Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.

ALONSO

    This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
    And there is in this business more than nature
    Was ever conduct of: some oracle
    Must rectify our knowledge.

PROSPERO

    Sir, my liege,
    Do not infest your mind with beating on
    The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
    Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
    Which to you shall seem probable, of every
    These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
    And think of each thing well.

    Aside to ARIEL
    Come hither, spirit:
    Set Caliban and his companions free;
    Untie the spell.

    Exit ARIEL
    How fares my gracious sir?
    There are yet missing of your company
    Some few odd lads that you remember not.

    Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel

STEPHANO

    Every man shift for all the rest, and
    let no man take care for himself; for all is
    but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!

TRINCULO

    If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
    here's a goodly sight.

CALIBAN

    O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
    How fine my master is! I am afraid
    He will chastise me.

SEBASTIAN

    Ha, ha!
    What things are these, my lord Antonio?
    Will money buy 'em?

ANTONIO

    Very like; one of them
    Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.

PROSPERO

    Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
    Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
    His mother was a witch, and one so strong
    That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
    And deal in her command without her power.
    These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--
    For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
    To take my life. Two of these fellows you
    Must know and own; this thing of darkness!
    Acknowledge mine.

CALIBAN

    I shall be pinch'd to death.

ALONSO

    Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?

SEBASTIAN

    He is drunk now: where had he wine?

ALONSO

    And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
    Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
    How camest thou in this pickle?

TRINCULO

    I have been in such a pickle since I
    saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of
    my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.

SEBASTIAN

    Why, how now, Stephano!

STEPHANO

    O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.

PROSPERO

    You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?

STEPHANO

    I should have been a sore one then.

ALONSO

    This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.

    Pointing to Caliban

PROSPERO

    He is as disproportion'd in his manners
    As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
    Take with you your companions; as you look
    To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.

CALIBAN

    Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter
    And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
    Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
    And worship this dull fool!

PROSPERO

    Go to; away!

ALONSO

    Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.

SEBASTIAN

    Or stole it, rather.

    Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO

PROSPERO

    Sir, I invite your highness and your train
    To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
    For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
    With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
    Go quick away; the story of my life
    And the particular accidents gone by
    Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
    I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
    Where I have hope to see the nuptial
    Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
    And thence retire me to my Milan, where
    Every third thought shall be my grave.

ALONSO

    I long
    To hear the story of your life, which must
    Take the ear strangely.

PROSPERO

    I'll deliver all;
    And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales
    And sail so expeditious that shall catch
    Your royal fleet far off.

    Aside to ARIEL
    My Ariel, chick,
    That is thy charge: then to the elements
    Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.

    Exeunt
    EPILOGUE
    SPOKEN BY PROSPERO
    Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
    And what strength I have's mine own,
    Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
    I must be here confined by you,
    Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
    Since I have my dukedom got
    And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
    In this bare island by your spell;
    But release me from my bands
    With the help of your good hands:
    Gentle breath of yours my sails
    Must fill, or else my project fails,
    Which was to please. Now I want
    Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
    And my ending is despair,
    Unless I be relieved by prayer,
    Which pierces so that it assaults
    Mercy itself and frees all faults.
    As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
    Let your indulgence set me free.



Troilus and Cressida

ACT I
PROLOGUE

    In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
    The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,
    Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
    Fraught with the ministers and instruments
    Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore
    Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay
    Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made
    To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures
    The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,
    With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.
    To Tenedos they come;
    And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
    Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
    The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
    Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,
    Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,
    And Antenorides, with massy staples
    And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
    Sperr up the sons of Troy.
    Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,
    On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
    Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come
    A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
    Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited
    In like conditions as our argument,
    To tell you, fair beholders, that our play
    Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,
    Beginning in the middle, starting thence away
    To what may be digested in a play.
    Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:
    Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.

SCENE I. Troy. Before Priam's palace.

    Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS

TROILUS

    Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
    Why should I war without the walls of Troy,
    That find such cruel battle here within?
    Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
    Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.

PANDARUS

    Will this gear ne'er be mended?

TROILUS

    The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
    Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;
    But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
    Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
    Less valiant than the virgin in the night
    And skilless as unpractised infancy.

PANDARUS

    Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,
    I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
    have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.

TROILUS

    Have I not tarried?

PANDARUS

    Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry
    the bolting.

TROILUS

    Have I not tarried?

PANDARUS

    Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.

TROILUS

    Still have I tarried.

PANDARUS

    Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
    'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the
    heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must
    stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.

TROILUS

    Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
    Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
    At Priam's royal table do I sit;
    And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--
    So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?

PANDARUS

    Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw
    her look, or any woman else.

TROILUS

    I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,
    As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
    Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
    I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
    Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
    But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,
    Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.

PANDARUS

    An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--
    well, go to--there were no more comparison between
    the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I
    would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would
    somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I
    will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--

TROILUS

    O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--
    When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,
    Reply not in how many fathoms deep
    They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
    In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'
    Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
    Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
    Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,
    In whose comparison all whites are ink,
    Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
    The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
    Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,
    As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;
    But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
    Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
    The knife that made it.

PANDARUS

    I speak no more than truth.

TROILUS

    Thou dost not speak so much.

PANDARUS

    Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:
    if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be
    not, she has the mends in her own hands.

TROILUS

    Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!

PANDARUS

    I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of
    her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and
    between, but small thanks for my labour.

TROILUS

    What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?

PANDARUS

    Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair
    as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as
    fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
    I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.

TROILUS

    Say I she is not fair?

PANDARUS

    I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to
    stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so
    I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,
    I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.

TROILUS

    Pandarus,--

PANDARUS

    Not I.

TROILUS

    Sweet Pandarus,--

PANDARUS

    Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I
    found it, and there an end.

    Exit PANDARUS. An alarum

TROILUS

    Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
    Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
    When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
    I cannot fight upon this argument;
    It is too starved a subject for my sword.
    But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!
    I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
    And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.
    As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
    Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
    What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
    Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:
    Between our Ilium and where she resides,
    Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,
    Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
    Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.

    Alarum. Enter AENEAS

AENEAS

    How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?

TROILUS

    Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,
    For womanish it is to be from thence.
    What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?

AENEAS

    That Paris is returned home and hurt.

TROILUS

    By whom, AEneas?

AENEAS

    Troilus, by Menelaus.

TROILUS

    Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;
    Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.

    Alarum

AENEAS

    Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!

TROILUS

    Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'
    But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?

AENEAS

    In all swift haste.

TROILUS

    Come, go we then together.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The Same. A street.

    Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER

CRESSIDA

    Who were those went by?

ALEXANDER

    Queen Hecuba and Helen.

CRESSIDA

    And whither go they?

ALEXANDER

    Up to the eastern tower,
    Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
    To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
    Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
    He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,
    And, like as there were husbandry in war,
    Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
    And to the field goes he; where every flower
    Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
    In Hector's wrath.

CRESSIDA

    What was his cause of anger?

ALEXANDER

    The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
    A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
    They call him Ajax.

CRESSIDA

    Good; and what of him?

ALEXANDER

    They say he is a very man per se,
    And stands alone.

CRESSIDA

    So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.

ALEXANDER

    This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their
    particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,
    churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man
    into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
    valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with
    discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
    hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he
    carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
    cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the
    joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint
    that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,
    or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.

CRESSIDA

    But how should this man, that makes
    me smile, make Hector angry?

ALEXANDER

    They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
    struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath
    ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.

CRESSIDA

    Who comes here?

ALEXANDER

    Madam, your uncle Pandarus.

    Enter PANDARUS

CRESSIDA

    Hector's a gallant man.

ALEXANDER

    As may be in the world, lady.

PANDARUS

    What's that? what's that?

CRESSIDA

    Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.

PANDARUS

    Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?
    Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When
    were you at Ilium?

CRESSIDA

    This morning, uncle.

PANDARUS

    What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector
    armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
    up, was she?

CRESSIDA

    Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.

PANDARUS

    Even so: Hector was stirring early.

CRESSIDA

    That were we talking of, and of his anger.

PANDARUS

    Was he angry?

CRESSIDA

    So he says here.

PANDARUS

    True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay
    about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's
    Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
    heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.

CRESSIDA

    What, is he angry too?

PANDARUS

    Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.

CRESSIDA

    O Jupiter! there's no comparison.

PANDARUS

    What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a
    man if you see him?

CRESSIDA

    Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.

PANDARUS

    Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.

CRESSIDA

    Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.

PANDARUS

    No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.

CRESSIDA

    'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.

PANDARUS

    Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.

CRESSIDA

    So he is.

PANDARUS

    Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.

CRESSIDA

    He is not Hector.

PANDARUS

    Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
    himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend
    or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were
    in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.

CRESSIDA

    Excuse me.

PANDARUS

    He is elder.

CRESSIDA

    Pardon me, pardon me.

PANDARUS

    Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another
    tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not
    have his wit this year.

CRESSIDA

    He shall not need it, if he have his own.

PANDARUS

    Nor his qualities.

CRESSIDA

    No matter.

PANDARUS

    Nor his beauty.

CRESSIDA

    'Twould not become him; his own's better.

PANDARUS

    You have no judgment, niece: Helen
    herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for
    a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--
    not brown neither,--

CRESSIDA

    No, but brown.

PANDARUS

    'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.

CRESSIDA

    To say the truth, true and not true.

PANDARUS

    She praised his complexion above Paris.

CRESSIDA

    Why, Paris hath colour enough.

PANDARUS

    So he has.

CRESSIDA

    Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
    him above, his complexion is higher than his; he
    having colour enough, and the other higher, is too
    flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
    lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
    a copper nose.

PANDARUS

    I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.

CRESSIDA

    Then she's a merry Greek indeed.

PANDARUS

    Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other
    day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he
    has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--

CRESSIDA

    Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
    particulars therein to a total.

PANDARUS

    Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within
    three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.

CRESSIDA

    Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?

PANDARUS

    But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came
    and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--

CRESSIDA

    Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?

PANDARUS

    Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling
    becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.

CRESSIDA

    O, he smiles valiantly.

PANDARUS

    Does he not?

CRESSIDA

    O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.

PANDARUS

    Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen
    loves Troilus,--

CRESSIDA

    Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll
    prove it so.

PANDARUS

    Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem
    an addle egg.

CRESSIDA

    If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
    head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.

PANDARUS

    I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled
    his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I
    must needs confess,--

CRESSIDA

    Without the rack.

PANDARUS

    And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.

CRESSIDA

    Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.

PANDARUS

    But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed
    that her eyes ran o'er.

CRESSIDA

    With mill-stones.

PANDARUS

    And Cassandra laughed.

CRESSIDA

    But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
    her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?

PANDARUS

    And Hector laughed.

CRESSIDA

    At what was all this laughing?

PANDARUS

    Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.

CRESSIDA

    An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
    too.

PANDARUS

    They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.

CRESSIDA

    What was his answer?

PANDARUS

    Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your
    chin, and one of them is white.

CRESSIDA

    This is her question.

PANDARUS

    That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and
    fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white
    hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'
    'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,
    my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't
    out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!
    and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the
    rest so laughed, that it passed.

CRESSIDA

    So let it now; for it has been while going by.

PANDARUS

    Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.

CRESSIDA

    So I do.

PANDARUS

    I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere
    a man born in April.

CRESSIDA

    And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
    against May.

    A retreat sounded

PANDARUS

    Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
    stand up here, and see them as they pass toward
    Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.

CRESSIDA

    At your pleasure.

PANDARUS

    Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may
    see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their
    names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.

CRESSIDA

    Speak not so loud.

    AENEAS passes

PANDARUS

    That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of
    the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark
    Troilus; you shall see anon.

    ANTENOR passes

CRESSIDA

    Who's that?

PANDARUS

    That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;
    and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest
    judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.
    When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if
    he see me, you shall see him nod at me.

CRESSIDA

    Will he give you the nod?

PANDARUS

    You shall see.

CRESSIDA

    If he do, the rich shall have more.

    HECTOR passes

PANDARUS

    That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a
    fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,
    niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
    a countenance! is't not a brave man?

CRESSIDA

    O, a brave man!

PANDARUS

    Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you
    what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do
    you see? look you there: there's no jesting;
    there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:
    there be hacks!

CRESSIDA

    Be those with swords?

PANDARUS

    Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come
    to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's
    heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.

    PARIS passes
    Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,
    is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came
    hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do
    Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see
    Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.

    HELENUS passes

CRESSIDA

    Who's that?

PANDARUS

    That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
    Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.

CRESSIDA

    Can Helenus fight, uncle?

PANDARUS

    Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I
    marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the
    people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.

CRESSIDA

    What sneaking fellow comes yonder?

    TROILUS passes

PANDARUS

    Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!
    there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the
    prince of chivalry!

CRESSIDA

    Peace, for shame, peace!

PANDARUS

    Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon
    him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and
    his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,
    and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw
    three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!
    Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,
    he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?
    Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to
    change, would give an eye to boot.

CRESSIDA

    Here come more.

    Forces pass

PANDARUS

    Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
    porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the
    eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles
    are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
    rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
    all Greece.

CRESSIDA

    There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.

PANDARUS

    Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.

CRESSIDA

    Well, well.

PANDARUS

    'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have
    you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
    birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,
    learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,
    and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?

CRESSIDA

    Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date
    in the pie, for then the man's date's out.

PANDARUS

    You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you
    lie.

CRESSIDA

    Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to
    defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine
    honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to
    defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a
    thousand watches.

PANDARUS

    Say one of your watches.

CRESSIDA

    Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
    chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
    not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took
    the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's
    past watching.

PANDARUS

    You are such another!

    Enter Troilus's Boy

Boy

    Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.

PANDARUS

    Where?

Boy

    At your own house; there he unarms him.

PANDARUS

    Good boy, tell him I come.

    Exit boy
    I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.

CRESSIDA

    Adieu, uncle.

PANDARUS

    I'll be with you, niece, by and by.

CRESSIDA

    To bring, uncle?

PANDARUS

    Ay, a token from Troilus.

CRESSIDA

    By the same token, you are a bawd.

    Exit PANDARUS
    Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
    He offers in another's enterprise;
    But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
    Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;
    Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
    Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
    That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
    Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
    That she was never yet that ever knew
    Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
    Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
    Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:
    Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
    Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.

    Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES, MENELAUS, and others

AGAMEMNON

    Princes,
    What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
    The ample proposition that hope makes
    In all designs begun on earth below
    Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
    Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
    As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
    Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
    Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
    Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
    That we come short of our suppose so far
    That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
    Sith every action that hath gone before,
    Whereof we have record, trial did draw
    Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
    And that unbodied figure of the thought
    That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
    Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,
    And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
    But the protractive trials of great Jove
    To find persistive constancy in men:
    The fineness of which metal is not found
    In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
    The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
    The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:
    But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
    Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
    Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
    And what hath mass or matter, by itself
    Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.

NESTOR

    With due observance of thy godlike seat,
    Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
    Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
    Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
    How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
    Upon her patient breast, making their way
    With those of nobler bulk!
    But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
    The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
    The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
    Bounding between the two moist elements,
    Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
    Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
    Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,
    Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
    Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
    In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
    The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
    Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
    Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
    And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage
    As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,
    And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
    Retorts to chiding fortune.

ULYSSES

    Agamemnon,
    Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
    Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.
    In whom the tempers and the minds of all
    Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
    Besides the applause and approbation To which,

    To AGAMEMNON
    most mighty for thy place and sway,

    To NESTOR
    And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life
    I give to both your speeches, which were such
    As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
    Should hold up high in brass, and such again
    As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,
    Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
    On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears
    To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,
    Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.

AGAMEMNON

    Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect
    That matter needless, of importless burden,
    Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
    When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
    We shall hear music, wit and oracle.

ULYSSES

    Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
    And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
    But for these instances.
    The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
    And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand
    Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
    When that the general is not like the hive
    To whom the foragers shall all repair,
    What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
    The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
    The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre
    Observe degree, priority and place,
    Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
    Office and custom, in all line of order;
    And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
    In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
    Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye
    Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
    And posts, like the commandment of a king,
    Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets
    In evil mixture to disorder wander,
    What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!
    What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
    Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,
    Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
    The unity and married calm of states
    Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,
    Which is the ladder to all high designs,
    Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,
    Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
    Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
    The primogenitive and due of birth,
    Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
    But by degree, stand in authentic place?
    Take but degree away, untune that string,
    And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
    In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
    Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
    And make a sop of all this solid globe:
    Strength should be lord of imbecility,
    And the rude son should strike his father dead:
    Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
    Between whose endless jar justice resides,
    Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
    Then every thing includes itself in power,
    Power into will, will into appetite;
    And appetite, an universal wolf,
    So doubly seconded with will and power,
    Must make perforce an universal prey,
    And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
    This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
    Follows the choking.
    And this neglection of degree it is
    That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
    It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
    By him one step below, he by the next,
    That next by him beneath; so every step,
    Exampled by the first pace that is sick
    Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
    Of pale and bloodless emulation:
    And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
    Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
    Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.

NESTOR

    Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
    The fever whereof all our power is sick.

AGAMEMNON

    The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
    What is the remedy?

ULYSSES

    The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
    The sinew and the forehand of our host,
    Having his ear full of his airy fame,
    Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
    Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
    Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
    Breaks scurril jests;
    And with ridiculous and awkward action,
    Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
    He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
    Thy topless deputation he puts on,
    And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
    Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
    To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
    'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--
    Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
    He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
    'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,
    Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd
    Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
    The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
    From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
    Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
    Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
    As he being drest to some oration.'
    That's done, as near as the extremest ends
    Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:
    Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
    'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
    Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
    And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
    Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
    And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
    Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
    Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
    Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
    In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,
    All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
    Severals and generals of grace exact,
    Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
    Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
    Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
    As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.

NESTOR

    And in the imitation of these twain--
    Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
    With an imperial voice--many are infect.
    Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head
    In such a rein, in full as proud a place
    As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;
    Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,
    Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
    A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
    To match us in comparisons with dirt,
    To weaken and discredit our exposure,
    How rank soever rounded in with danger.

ULYSSES

    They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,
    Count wisdom as no member of the war,
    Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
    But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
    That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
    When fitness calls them on, and know by measure
    Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--
    Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
    They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;
    So that the ram that batters down the wall,
    For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,
    They place before his hand that made the engine,
    Or those that with the fineness of their souls
    By reason guide his execution.

NESTOR

    Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
    Makes many Thetis' sons.

    A tucket

AGAMEMNON

    What trumpet? look, Menelaus.

MENELAUS

    From Troy.

    Enter AENEAS

AGAMEMNON

    What would you 'fore our tent?

AENEAS

    Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?

AGAMEMNON

    Even this.

AENEAS

    May one, that is a herald and a prince,
    Do a fair message to his kingly ears?

AGAMEMNON

    With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
    'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
    Call Agamemnon head and general.

AENEAS

    Fair leave and large security. How may
    A stranger to those most imperial looks
    Know them from eyes of other mortals?

AGAMEMNON

    How!

AENEAS

    Ay;
    I ask, that I might waken reverence,
    And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
    Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
    The youthful Phoebus:
    Which is that god in office, guiding men?
    Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?

AGAMEMNON

    This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
    Are ceremonious courtiers.

AENEAS

    Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
    As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:
    But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
    Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,
    Jove's accord,
    Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,
    Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!
    The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
    If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:
    But what the repining enemy commends,
    That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,
    transcends.

AGAMEMNON

    Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?

AENEAS

    Ay, Greek, that is my name.

AGAMEMNON

    What's your affair I pray you?

AENEAS

    Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.

AGAMEMNON

    He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.

AENEAS

    Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:
    I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
    To set his sense on the attentive bent,
    And then to speak.

AGAMEMNON

    Speak frankly as the wind;
    It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
    That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,
    He tells thee so himself.

AENEAS

    Trumpet, blow loud,
    Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
    And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
    What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.

    Trumpet sounds
    We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
    A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--
    Who in this dull and long-continued truce
    Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,
    And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
    If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
    That holds his honour higher than his ease,
    That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
    That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,
    That loves his mistress more than in confession,
    With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
    And dare avow her beauty and her worth
    In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.
    Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
    Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
    He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
    Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,
    And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
    Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
    To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
    If any come, Hector shall honour him;
    If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,
    The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
    The splinter of a lance. Even so much.

AGAMEMNON

    This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;
    If none of them have soul in such a kind,
    We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;
    And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
    That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
    If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
    That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.

NESTOR

    Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
    When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;
    But if there be not in our Grecian host
    One noble man that hath one spark of fire,
    To answer for his love, tell him from me
    I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
    And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
    And meeting him will tell him that my lady
    Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
    As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
    I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.

AENEAS

    Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!

ULYSSES

    Amen.

AGAMEMNON

    Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;
    To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
    Achilles shall have word of this intent;
    So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
    Yourself shall feast with us before you go
    And find the welcome of a noble foe.

    Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR

ULYSSES

    Nestor!

NESTOR

    What says Ulysses?

ULYSSES

    I have a young conception in my brain;
    Be you my time to bring it to some shape.

NESTOR

    What is't?

ULYSSES

    This 'tis:
    Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
    That hath to this maturity blown up
    In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,
    Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,
    To overbulk us all.

NESTOR

    Well, and how?

ULYSSES

    This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
    However it is spread in general name,
    Relates in purpose only to Achilles.

NESTOR

    The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,
    Whose grossness little characters sum up:
    And, in the publication, make no strain,
    But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
    As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,
    'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,
    Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose
    Pointing on him.

ULYSSES

    And wake him to the answer, think you?

NESTOR

    Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
    That can from Hector bring his honour off,
    If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,
    Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
    For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
    With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,
    Our imputation shall be oddly poised
    In this wild action; for the success,
    Although particular, shall give a scantling
    Of good or bad unto the general;
    And in such indexes, although small pricks
    To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
    The baby figure of the giant mass
    Of things to come at large. It is supposed
    He that meets Hector issues from our choice
    And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
    Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
    As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd
    Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
    What heart receives from hence the conquering part,
    To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
    Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
    In no less working than are swords and bows
    Directive by the limbs.

ULYSSES

    Give pardon to my speech:
    Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
    Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,
    And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,
    The lustre of the better yet to show,
    Shall show the better. Do not consent
    That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
    For both our honour and our shame in this
    Are dogg'd with two strange followers.

NESTOR

    I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?

ULYSSES

    What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
    Were he not proud, we all should share with him:
    But he already is too insolent;
    A nd we were better parch in Afric sun
    Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
    Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,
    Why then, we did our main opinion crush
    In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;
    And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
    The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
    Give him allowance for the better man;
    For that will physic the great Myrmidon
    Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
    His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
    If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
    We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,
    Yet go we under our opinion still
    That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
    Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:
    Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.

NESTOR

    Ulysses,
    Now I begin to relish thy advice;
    And I will give a taste of it forthwith
    To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.
    Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
    Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A part of the Grecian camp.

    Enter AJAX and THERSITES

AJAX

    Thersites!

THERSITES

    Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,
    generally?

AJAX

    Thersites!

THERSITES

    And those boils did run? say so: did not the
    general run then? were not that a botchy core?

AJAX

    Dog!

THERSITES

    Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.

AJAX

    Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?

    Beating him
    Feel, then.

THERSITES

    The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel
    beef-witted lord!

AJAX

    Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will
    beat thee into handsomeness.

THERSITES

    I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,
    I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than
    thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,
    canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!

AJAX

    Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.

THERSITES

    Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?

AJAX

    The proclamation!

THERSITES

    Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.

AJAX

    Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.

THERSITES

    I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had
    the scratching of thee; I would make thee the
    loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in
    the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.

AJAX

    I say, the proclamation!

THERSITES

    Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,
    and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as
    Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty, ay, that thou
    barkest at him.

AJAX

    Mistress Thersites!

THERSITES

    Thou shouldest strike him.

AJAX

    Cobloaf!

THERSITES

    He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a
    sailor breaks a biscuit.

AJAX

    [Beating him] You whoreson cur!

THERSITES

    Do, do.

AJAX

    Thou stool for a witch!

THERSITES

    Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no
    more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinego
    may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art
    here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and
    sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave.
    If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel, and
    tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no
    bowels, thou!

AJAX

    You dog!

THERSITES

    You scurvy lord!

AJAX

    [Beating him] You cur!

THERSITES

    Mars his idiot! do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.

    Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS

ACHILLES

    Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,
    Thersites! what's the matter, man?

THERSITES

    You see him there, do you?

ACHILLES

    Ay; what's the matter?

THERSITES

    Nay, look upon him.

ACHILLES

    So I do: what's the matter?

THERSITES

    Nay, but regard him well.

ACHILLES

    'Well!' why, I do so.

THERSITES

    But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever you
    take him to be, he is Ajax.

ACHILLES

    I know that, fool.

THERSITES

    Ay, but that fool knows not himself.

AJAX

    Therefore I beat thee.

THERSITES

    Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his
    evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his
    brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy
    nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not
    worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,
    Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and
    his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of
    him.

ACHILLES

    What?

THERSITES

    I say, this Ajax--

    Ajax offers to beat him

ACHILLES

    Nay, good Ajax.

THERSITES

    Has not so much wit--

ACHILLES

    Nay, I must hold you.

THERSITES

    As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he
    comes to fight.

ACHILLES

    Peace, fool!

THERSITES

    I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will
    not: he there: that he: look you there.

AJAX

    O thou damned cur! I shall--

ACHILLES

    Will you set your wit to a fool's?

THERSITES

    No, I warrant you; for a fools will shame it.

PATROCLUS

    Good words, Thersites.

ACHILLES

    What's the quarrel?

AJAX

    I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the
    proclamation, and he rails upon me.

THERSITES

    I serve thee not.

AJAX

    Well, go to, go to.

THERSITES

    I serve here voluntarily.

ACHILLES

    Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not
    voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was
    here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.

THERSITES

    E'en so; a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your
    sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great
    catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'
    were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.

ACHILLES

    What, with me too, Thersites?

THERSITES

    There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy
    ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you
    like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.

ACHILLES

    What, what?

THERSITES

    Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!

AJAX

    I shall cut out your tongue.

THERSITES

    'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou
    afterwards.

PATROCLUS

    No more words, Thersites; peace!

THERSITES

    I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?

ACHILLES

    There's for you, Patroclus.

THERSITES

    I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come
    any more to your tents: I will keep where there is
    wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.

    Exit

PATROCLUS

    A good riddance.

ACHILLES

    Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:
    That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,
    Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
    To-morrow morning call some knight to arms
    That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare
    Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.

AJAX

    Farewell. Who shall answer him?

ACHILLES

    I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise
    He knew his man.

AJAX

    O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Troy. A room in Priam's palace.

    Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS

PRIAM

    After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
    Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
    'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--
    As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
    Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed
    In hot digestion of this cormorant war--
    Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?

HECTOR

    Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
    As far as toucheth my particular,
    Yet, dread Priam,
    There is no lady of more softer bowels,
    More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
    More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
    Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,
    Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
    The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
    To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
    Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
    Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
    Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:
    If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
    To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
    Had it our name, the value of one ten,
    What merit's in that reason which denies
    The yielding of her up?

TROILUS

    Fie, fie, my brother!
    Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
    So great as our dread father in a scale
    Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
    The past proportion of his infinite?
    And buckle in a waist most fathomless
    With spans and inches so diminutive
    As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!

HELENUS

    No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,
    You are so empty of them. Should not our father
    Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,
    Because your speech hath none that tells him so?

TROILUS

    You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
    You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
    your reasons:
    You know an enemy intends you harm;
    You know a sword employ'd is perilous,
    And reason flies the object of all harm:
    Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds
    A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
    The very wings of reason to his heels
    And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
    Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,
    Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour
    Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat
    their thoughts
    With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
    Make livers pale and lustihood deject.

HECTOR

    Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
    The holding.

TROILUS

    What is aught, but as 'tis valued?

HECTOR

    But value dwells not in particular will;
    It holds his estimate and dignity
    As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
    As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
    To make the service greater than the god
    And the will dotes that is attributive
    To what infectiously itself affects,
    Without some image of the affected merit.

TROILUS

    I take to-day a wife, and my election
    Is led on in the conduct of my will;
    My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
    Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
    Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,
    Although my will distaste what it elected,
    The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
    To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:
    We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,
    When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands
    We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
    Because we now are full. It was thought meet
    Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
    Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
    The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce
    And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,
    And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
    He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
    Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.
    Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
    Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
    Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
    And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
    If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
    As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--
    If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
    As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands
    And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
    The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
    And do a deed that fortune never did,
    Beggar the estimation which you prized
    Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
    That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
    But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,
    That in their country did them that disgrace,
    We fear to warrant in our native place!

CASSANDRA

    [Within] Cry, Trojans, cry!

PRIAM

    What noise? what shriek is this?

TROILUS

    'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.

CASSANDRA

    [Within] Cry, Trojans!

HECTOR

    It is Cassandra.

    Enter CASSANDRA, raving

CASSANDRA

    Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,
    And I will fill them with prophetic tears.

HECTOR

    Peace, sister, peace!

CASSANDRA

    Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,
    Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
    Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
    A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
    Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
    Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
    Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.
    Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:
    Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.

    Exit

HECTOR

    Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
    Of divination in our sister work
    Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
    So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
    Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
    Can qualify the same?

TROILUS

    Why, brother Hector,
    We may not think the justness of each act
    Such and no other than event doth form it,
    Nor once deject the courage of our minds,
    Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
    Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
    Which hath our several honours all engaged
    To make it gracious. For my private part,
    I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:
    And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
    Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
    To fight for and maintain!

PARIS

    Else might the world convince of levity
    As well my undertakings as your counsels:
    But I attest the gods, your full consent
    Gave wings to my propension and cut off
    All fears attending on so dire a project.
    For what, alas, can these my single arms?
    What Propugnation is in one man's valour,
    To stand the push and enmity of those
    This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
    Were I alone to pass the difficulties
    And had as ample power as I have will,
    Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
    Nor faint in the pursuit.

PRIAM

    Paris, you speak
    Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
    You have the honey still, but these the gall;
    So to be valiant is no praise at all.

PARIS

    Sir, I propose not merely to myself
    The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
    But I would have the soil of her fair rape
    Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
    What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
    Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,
    Now to deliver her possession up
    On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
    That so degenerate a strain as this
    Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
    There's not the meanest spirit on our party
    Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
    When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
    Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
    Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,
    Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
    The world's large spaces cannot parallel.

HECTOR

    Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
    And on the cause and question now in hand
    Have glozed, but superficially: not much
    Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
    Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
    The reasons you allege do more conduce
    To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
    Than to make up a free determination
    'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
    Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
    Of any true decision. Nature craves
    All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
    What nearer debt in all humanity
    Than wife is to the husband? If this law
    Of nature be corrupted through affection,
    And that great minds, of partial indulgence
    To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
    There is a law in each well-order'd nation
    To curb those raging appetites that are
    Most disobedient and refractory.
    If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
    As it is known she is, these moral laws
    Of nature and of nations speak aloud
    To have her back return'd: thus to persist
    In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
    But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
    Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,
    My spritely brethren, I propend to you
    In resolution to keep Helen still,
    For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
    Upon our joint and several dignities.

TROILUS

    Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:
    Were it not glory that we more affected
    Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
    I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
    Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
    She is a theme of honour and renown,
    A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
    Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
    And fame in time to come canonize us;
    For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
    So rich advantage of a promised glory
    As smiles upon the forehead of this action
    For the wide world's revenue.

HECTOR

    I am yours,
    You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
    I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
    The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks
    Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:
    I was advertised their great general slept,
    Whilst emulation in the army crept:
    This, I presume, will wake him.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.

    Enter THERSITES, solus

THERSITES

    How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of
    thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He
    beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!
    would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,
    whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to
    conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of
    my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a
    rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two
    undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of
    themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,
    forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,
    Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy
    caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less
    than little wit from them that they have! which
    short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
    scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
    from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and
    cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the
    whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,
    methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war
    for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy
    say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!

    Enter PATROCLUS

PATROCLUS

    Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.

THERSITES

    If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou
    wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but
    it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common
    curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in
    great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and
    discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
    direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee
    out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and
    sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.
    Amen. Where's Achilles?

PATROCLUS

    What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?

THERSITES

    Ay: the heavens hear me!

    Enter ACHILLES

ACHILLES

    Who's there?

PATROCLUS

    Thersites, my lord.

ACHILLES

    Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my
    digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to
    my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?

THERSITES

    Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,
    what's Achilles?

PATROCLUS

    Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,
    what's thyself?

THERSITES

    Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,
    what art thou?

PATROCLUS

    Thou mayst tell that knowest.

ACHILLES

    O, tell, tell.

THERSITES

    I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands
    Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'
    knower, and Patroclus is a fool.

PATROCLUS

    You rascal!

THERSITES

    Peace, fool! I have not done.

ACHILLES

    He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.

THERSITES

    Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites
    is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.

ACHILLES

    Derive this; come.

THERSITES

    Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;
    Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;
    Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and
    Patroclus is a fool positive.

PATROCLUS

    Why am I a fool?

THERSITES

    Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou
    art. Look you, who comes here?

ACHILLES

    Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.
    Come in with me, Thersites.

    Exit

THERSITES

    Here is such patchery, such juggling and such
    knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a
    whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions
    and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on
    the subject! and war and lechery confound all!

    Exit

    Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and AJAX

AGAMEMNON

    Where is Achilles?

PATROCLUS

    Within his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.

AGAMEMNON

    Let it be known to him that we are here.
    He shent our messengers; and we lay by
    Our appertainments, visiting of him:
    Let him be told so; lest perchance he think
    We dare not move the question of our place,
    Or know not what we are.

PATROCLUS

    I shall say so to him.

    Exit

ULYSSES

    We saw him at the opening of his tent:
    He is not sick.

AJAX

    Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it
    melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my
    head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the
    cause. A word, my lord.

    Takes AGAMEMNON aside

NESTOR

    What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?

ULYSSES

    Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.

NESTOR

    Who, Thersites?

ULYSSES

    He.

NESTOR

    Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.

ULYSSES

    No, you see, he is his argument that has his
    argument, Achilles.

NESTOR

    All the better; their fraction is more our wish than
    their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool
    could disunite.

ULYSSES

    The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily
    untie. Here comes Patroclus.

    Re-enter PATROCLUS

NESTOR

    No Achilles with him.

ULYSSES

    The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:
    his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.

PATROCLUS

    Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,
    If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
    Did move your greatness and this noble state
    To call upon him; he hopes it is no other
    But for your health and your digestion sake,
    And after-dinner's breath.

AGAMEMNON

    Hear you, Patroclus:
    We are too well acquainted with these answers:
    But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
    Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
    Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
    Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,
    Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
    Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
    Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
    Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,
    We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,
    If you do say we think him over-proud
    And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
    Than in the note of judgment; and worthier
    than himself
    Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
    Disguise the holy strength of their command,
    And underwrite in an observing kind
    His humorous predominance; yea, watch
    His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if
    The passage and whole carriage of this action
    Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
    That if he overhold his price so much,
    We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine
    Not portable, lie under this report:
    'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:
    A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
    Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.

PATROCLUS

    I shall; and bring his answer presently.

    Exit

AGAMEMNON

    In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
    We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.

    Exit ULYSSES

AJAX

    What is he more than another?

AGAMEMNON

    No more than what he thinks he is.

AJAX

    Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a
    better man than I am?

AGAMEMNON

    No question.

AJAX

    Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?

AGAMEMNON

    No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as
    wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether
    more tractable.

AJAX

    Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
    know not what pride is.

AGAMEMNON

    Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the
    fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
    his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;
    and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours
    the deed in the praise.

AJAX

    I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.

NESTOR

    Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?

    Aside

    Re-enter ULYSSES

ULYSSES

    Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.

AGAMEMNON

    What's his excuse?

ULYSSES

    He doth rely on none,
    But carries on the stream of his dispose
    Without observance or respect of any,
    In will peculiar and in self-admission.

AGAMEMNON

    Why will he not upon our fair request
    Untent his person and share the air with us?

ULYSSES

    Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,
    He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,
    And speaks not to himself but with a pride
    That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
    Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
    That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
    Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
    And batters down himself: what should I say?
    He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
    Cry 'No recovery.'

AGAMEMNON

    Let Ajax go to him.
    Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
    'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led
    At your request a little from himself.

ULYSSES

    O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
    We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
    When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord
    That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
    And never suffers matter of the world
    Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
    And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd
    Of that we hold an idol more than he?
    No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
    Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;
    Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,
    As amply titled as Achilles is,
    By going to Achilles:
    That were to enlard his fat already pride
    And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
    With entertaining great Hyperion.
    This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
    And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'

NESTOR

    [Aside to DIOMEDES] O, this is well; he rubs the
    vein of him.

DIOMEDES

    [Aside to NESTOR] And how his silence drinks up
    this applause!

AJAX

    If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.

AGAMEMNON

    O, no, you shall not go.

AJAX

    An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:
    Let me go to him.

ULYSSES

    Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.

AJAX

    A paltry, insolent fellow!

NESTOR

    How he describes himself!

AJAX

    Can he not be sociable?

ULYSSES

    The raven chides blackness.

AJAX

    I'll let his humours blood.

AGAMEMNON

    He will be the physician that should be the patient.

AJAX

    An all men were o' my mind,--

ULYSSES

    Wit would be out of fashion.

AJAX

    A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:
    shall pride carry it?

NESTOR

    An 'twould, you'ld carry half.

ULYSSES

    A' would have ten shares.

AJAX

    I will knead him; I'll make him supple.

NESTOR

    He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:
    pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.

ULYSSES

    [To AGAMEMNON] My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.

NESTOR

    Our noble general, do not do so.

DIOMEDES

    You must prepare to fight without Achilles.

ULYSSES

    Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.
    Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
    I will be silent.

NESTOR

    Wherefore should you so?
    He is not emulous, as Achilles is.

ULYSSES

    Know the whole world, he is as valiant.

AJAX

    A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!
    Would he were a Trojan!

NESTOR

    What a vice were it in Ajax now,--

ULYSSES

    If he were proud,--

DIOMEDES

    Or covetous of praise,--

ULYSSES

    Ay, or surly borne,--

DIOMEDES

    Or strange, or self-affected!

ULYSSES

    Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;
    Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:
    Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature
    Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:
    But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,
    Let Mars divide eternity in twain,
    And give him half: and, for thy vigour,
    Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
    To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,
    Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines
    Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;
    Instructed by the antiquary times,
    He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:
    Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days
    As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,
    You should not have the eminence of him,
    But be as Ajax.

AJAX

    Shall I call you father?

NESTOR

    Ay, my good son.

DIOMEDES

    Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.

ULYSSES

    There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles
    Keeps thicket. Please it our great general
    To call together all his state of war;
    Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow
    We must with all our main of power stand fast:
    And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,
    And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.

AGAMEMNON

    Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
    Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Troy. Priam's palace.

    Enter a Servant and PANDARUS

PANDARUS

    Friend, you! pray you, a word: do not you follow
    the young Lord Paris?

Servant

    Ay, sir, when he goes before me.

PANDARUS

    You depend upon him, I mean?

Servant

    Sir, I do depend upon the lord.

PANDARUS

    You depend upon a noble gentleman; I must needs
    praise him.

Servant

    The lord be praised!

PANDARUS

    You know me, do you not?

Servant

    Faith, sir, superficially.

PANDARUS

    Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.

Servant

    I hope I shall know your honour better.

PANDARUS

    I do desire it.

Servant

    You are in the state of grace.

PANDARUS

    Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.

    Music within
    What music is this?

Servant

    I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.

PANDARUS

    Know you the musicians?

Servant

    Wholly, sir.

PANDARUS

    Who play they to?

Servant

    To the hearers, sir.

PANDARUS

    At whose pleasure, friend

Servant

    At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.

PANDARUS

    Command, I mean, friend.

Servant

    Who shall I command, sir?

PANDARUS

    Friend, we understand not one another: I am too
    courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request
    do these men play?

Servant

    That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request
    of Paris my lord, who's there in person; with him,
    the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's
    invisible soul,--

PANDARUS

    Who, my cousin Cressida?

Servant

    No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her
    attributes?

PANDARUS

    It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the
    Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the
    Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault
    upon him, for my business seethes.

Servant

    Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!

    Enter PARIS and HELEN, attended

PANDARUS

    Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair
    company! fair desires, in all fair measure,
    fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!
    fair thoughts be your fair pillow!

HELEN

    Dear lord, you are full of fair words.

PANDARUS

    You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair
    prince, here is good broken music.

PARIS

    You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you
    shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out
    with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full
    of harmony.

PANDARUS

    Truly, lady, no.

HELEN

    O, sir,--

PANDARUS

    Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.

PARIS

    Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.

PANDARUS

    I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,
    will you vouchsafe me a word?

HELEN

    Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you
    sing, certainly.

PANDARUS

    Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,
    marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed
    friend, your brother Troilus,--

HELEN

    My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--

PANDARUS

    Go to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself most
    affectionately to you,--

HELEN

    You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,
    our melancholy upon your head!

PANDARUS

    Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.

HELEN

    And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.

PANDARUS

    Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not,
    in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no,
    no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king
    call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.

HELEN

    My Lord Pandarus,--

PANDARUS

    What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?

PARIS

    What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?

HELEN

    Nay, but, my lord,--

PANDARUS

    What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out
    with you. You must not know where he sups.

PARIS

    I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.

PANDARUS

    No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, your
    disposer is sick.

PARIS

    Well, I'll make excuse.

PANDARUS

    Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,
    your poor disposer's sick.

PARIS

    I spy.

PANDARUS

    You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an
    instrument. Now, sweet queen.

HELEN

    Why, this is kindly done.

PANDARUS

    My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,
    sweet queen.

HELEN

    She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.

PANDARUS

    He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.

HELEN

    Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.

PANDARUS

    Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing
    you a song now.

HELEN

    Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou
    hast a fine forehead.

PANDARUS

    Ay, you may, you may.

HELEN

    Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.
    O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!

PANDARUS

    Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.

PARIS

    Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.

PANDARUS

    In good troth, it begins so.

    Sings
    Love, love, nothing but love, still more!
    For, O, love's bow
    Shoots buck and doe:
    The shaft confounds,
    Not that it wounds,
    But tickles still the sore.
    These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!
    Yet that which seems the wound to kill,
    Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!
    So dying love lives still:
    Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!
    Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!
    Heigh-ho!

HELEN

    In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.

PARIS

    He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot
    blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot
    thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.

PANDARUS

    Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot
    thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers:
    is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's
    a-field to-day?

PARIS

    Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the
    gallantry of Troy: I would fain have armed to-day,
    but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my
    brother Troilus went not?

HELEN

    He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.

PANDARUS

    Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they
    sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?

PARIS

    To a hair.

PANDARUS

    Farewell, sweet queen.

HELEN

    Commend me to your niece.

PANDARUS

    I will, sweet queen.

    Exit

    A retreat sounded

PARIS

    They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,
    To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
    To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,
    With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
    Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
    Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more
    Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.

HELEN

    'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;
    Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
    Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,
    Yea, overshines ourself.

PARIS

    Sweet, above thought I love thee.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. Pandarus' orchard.

    Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meeting

PANDARUS

    How now! where's thy master? at my cousin
    Cressida's?

Boy

    No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.

PANDARUS

    O, here he comes.

    Enter TROILUS
    How now, how now!

TROILUS

    Sirrah, walk off.

    Exit Boy

PANDARUS

    Have you seen my cousin?

TROILUS

    No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,
    Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
    Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,
    And give me swift transportance to those fields
    Where I may wallow in the lily-beds
    Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,
    From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
    And fly with me to Cressid!

PANDARUS

    Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.

    Exit

TROILUS

    I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
    The imaginary relish is so sweet
    That it enchants my sense: what will it be,
    When that the watery palate tastes indeed
    Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,
    Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
    Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,
    For the capacity of my ruder powers:
    I fear it much; and I do fear besides,
    That I shall lose distinction in my joys;
    As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps
    The enemy flying.

    Re-enter PANDARUS

PANDARUS

    She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you
    must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches
    her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a
    sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest
    villain: she fetches her breath as short as a
    new-ta'en sparrow.

    Exit

TROILUS

    Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:
    My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;
    And all my powers do their bestowing lose,
    Like vassalage at unawares encountering
    The eye of majesty.

    Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA

PANDARUS

    Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.
    Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that
    you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?
    you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?
    Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,
    we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to
    her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your
    picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend
    daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.
    So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!
    a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air
    is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere
    I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the
    ducks i' the river: go to, go to.

TROILUS

    You have bereft me of all words, lady.

PANDARUS

    Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll
    bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your
    activity in question. What, billing again? Here's
    'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--
    Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.

    Exit

CRESSIDA

    Will you walk in, my lord?

TROILUS

    O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!

CRESSIDA

    Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!

TROILUS

    What should they grant? what makes this pretty
    abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet
    lady in the fountain of our love?

CRESSIDA

    More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.

TROILUS

    Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.

CRESSIDA

    Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer
    footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to
    fear the worst oft cures the worse.

TROILUS

    O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's
    pageant there is presented no monster.

CRESSIDA

    Nor nothing monstrous neither?

TROILUS

    Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep
    seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking
    it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
    enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.
    This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will
    is infinite and the execution confined, that the
    desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.

CRESSIDA

    They say all lovers swear more performance than they
    are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
    perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and
    discharging less than the tenth part of one. They
    that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,
    are they not monsters?

TROILUS

    Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we
    are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go
    bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion
    shall have a praise in present: we will not name
    desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition
    shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus
    shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
    shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can
    speak truest not truer than Troilus.

CRESSIDA

    Will you walk in, my lord?

    Re-enter PANDARUS

PANDARUS

    What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?

CRESSIDA

    Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.

PANDARUS

    I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,
    you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he
    flinch, chide me for it.

TROILUS

    You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my
    firm faith.

PANDARUS

    Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,
    though they be long ere they are wooed, they are
    constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;
    they'll stick where they are thrown.

CRESSIDA

    Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.
    Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day
    For many weary months.

TROILUS

    Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?

CRESSIDA

    Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,
    With the first glance that ever--pardon me--
    If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
    I love you now; but not, till now, so much
    But I might master it: in faith, I lie;
    My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
    Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
    Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,
    When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
    But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;
    And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,
    Or that we women had men's privilege
    Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
    For in this rapture I shall surely speak
    The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
    Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
    My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.

TROILUS

    And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.

PANDARUS

    Pretty, i' faith.

CRESSIDA

    My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;
    'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:
    I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?
    For this time will I take my leave, my lord.

TROILUS

    Your leave, sweet Cressid!

PANDARUS

    Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--

CRESSIDA

    Pray you, content you.

TROILUS

    What offends you, lady?

CRESSIDA

    Sir, mine own company.

TROILUS

    You cannot shun Yourself.

CRESSIDA

    Let me go and try:
    I have a kind of self resides with you;
    But an unkind self, that itself will leave,
    To be another's fool. I would be gone:
    Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.

TROILUS

    Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.

CRESSIDA

    Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;
    And fell so roundly to a large confession,
    To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,
    Or else you love not, for to be wise and love
    Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.

TROILUS

    O that I thought it could be in a woman--
    As, if it can, I will presume in you--
    To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;
    To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
    Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
    That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
    Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,
    That my integrity and truth to you
    Might be affronted with the match and weight
    Of such a winnow'd purity in love;
    How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
    I am as true as truth's simplicity
    And simpler than the infancy of truth.

CRESSIDA

    In that I'll war with you.

TROILUS

    O virtuous fight,
    When right with right wars who shall be most right!
    True swains in love shall in the world to come
    Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,
    Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
    Want similes, truth tired with iteration,
    As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
    As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
    As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,
    Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
    As truth's authentic author to be cited,
    'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,
    And sanctify the numbers.

CRESSIDA

    Prophet may you be!
    If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
    When time is old and hath forgot itself,
    When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,
    And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
    And mighty states characterless are grated
    To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
    From false to false, among false maids in love,
    Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false
    As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
    As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,
    Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'
    'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
    'As false as Cressid.'

PANDARUS

    Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the
    witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.
    If ever you prove false one to another, since I have
    taken such pains to bring you together, let all
    pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end
    after my name; call them all Pandars; let all
    constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,
    and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.

TROILUS

    Amen.

CRESSIDA

    Amen.

PANDARUS

    Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a
    bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your
    pretty encounters, press it to death: away!
    And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
    Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.

    Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX, MENELAUS, and CALCHAS

CALCHAS

    Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
    The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
    To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
    That, through the sight I bear in things to love,
    I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
    Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,
    From certain and possess'd conveniences,
    To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all
    That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
    Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
    And here, to do you service, am become
    As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:
    I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
    To give me now a little benefit,
    Out of those many register'd in promise,
    Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.

AGAMEMNON

    What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.

CALCHAS

    You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,
    Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
    Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
    Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
    Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
    I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
    That their negotiations all must slack,
    Wanting his manage; and they will almost
    Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
    In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
    And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
    Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
    In most accepted pain.

AGAMEMNON

    Let Diomedes bear him,
    And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
    What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
    Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
    Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
    Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.

DIOMEDES

    This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
    Which I am proud to bear.

    Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS

    Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent

ULYSSES

    Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
    Please it our general to pass strangely by him,
    As if he were forgot; and, princes all,
    Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
    I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
    Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
    If so, I have derision medicinable,
    To use between your strangeness and his pride,
    Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
    It may be good: pride hath no other glass
    To show itself but pride, for supple knees
    Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.

AGAMEMNON

    We'll execute your purpose, and put on
    A form of strangeness as we pass along:
    So do each lord, and either greet him not,
    Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
    Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.

ACHILLES

    What, comes the general to speak with me?
    You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.

AGAMEMNON

    What says Achilles? would he aught with us?

NESTOR

    Would you, my lord, aught with the general?

ACHILLES

    No.

NESTOR

    Nothing, my lord.

AGAMEMNON

    The better.

    Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR

ACHILLES

    Good day, good day.

MENELAUS

    How do you? how do you?

    Exit

ACHILLES

    What, does the cuckold scorn me?

AJAX

    How now, Patroclus!

ACHILLES

    Good morrow, Ajax.

AJAX

    Ha?

ACHILLES

    Good morrow.

AJAX

    Ay, and good next day too.

    Exit

ACHILLES

    What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?

PATROCLUS

    They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
    To send their smiles before them to Achilles;
    To come as humbly as they used to creep
    To holy altars.

ACHILLES

    What, am I poor of late?
    'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
    Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
    He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
    As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
    Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
    And not a man, for being simply man,
    Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
    That are without him, as place, riches, favour,
    Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
    Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
    The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
    Do one pluck down another and together
    Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
    Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
    At ample point all that I did possess,
    Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
    Something not worth in me such rich beholding
    As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;
    I'll interrupt his reading.
    How now Ulysses!

ULYSSES

    Now, great Thetis' son!

ACHILLES

    What are you reading?

ULYSSES

    A strange fellow here
    Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,
    How much in having, or without or in,
    Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
    Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
    As when his virtues shining upon others
    Heat them and they retort that heat again
    To the first giver.'

ACHILLES

    This is not strange, Ulysses.
    The beauty that is borne here in the face
    The bearer knows not, but commends itself
    To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,
    That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
    Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
    Salutes each other with each other's form;
    For speculation turns not to itself,
    Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
    Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.

ULYSSES

    I do not strain at the position,--
    It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;
    Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
    That no man is the lord of any thing,
    Though in and of him there be much consisting,
    Till he communicate his parts to others:
    Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
    Till he behold them form'd in the applause
    Where they're extended; who, like an arch,
    reverberates
    The voice again, or, like a gate of steel
    Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
    His figure and his heat. I was much wrapt in this;
    And apprehended here immediately
    The unknown Ajax.
    Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,
    That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
    Most abject in regard and dear in use!
    What things again most dear in the esteem
    And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
    An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
    Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
    While some men leave to do!
    How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
    Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
    How one man eats into another's pride,
    While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
    To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already
    They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
    As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
    And great Troy shrieking.

ACHILLES

    I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
    As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
    Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?

ULYSSES

    Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
    Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
    A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
    Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
    As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
    As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
    Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
    Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
    In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
    For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
    Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
    For emulation hath a thousand sons
    That one by one pursue: if you give way,
    Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
    Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
    And leave you hindmost;
    Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
    Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
    O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
    Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
    For time is like a fashionable host
    That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
    And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
    Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
    And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not
    virtue seek
    Remuneration for the thing it was;
    For beauty, wit,
    High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
    Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
    To envious and calumniating time.
    One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
    That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
    Though they are made and moulded of things past,
    And give to dust that is a little gilt
    More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
    The present eye praises the present object.
    Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
    That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
    Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
    Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
    And still it might, and yet it may again,
    If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
    And case thy reputation in thy tent;
    Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
    Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
    And drave great Mars to faction.

ACHILLES

    Of this my privacy
    I have strong reasons.

ULYSSES

    But 'gainst your privacy
    The reasons are more potent and heroical:
    'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
    With one of Priam's daughters.

ACHILLES

    Ha! known!

ULYSSES

    Is that a wonder?
    The providence that's in a watchful state
    Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,
    Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,
    Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
    Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
    There is a mystery--with whom relation
    Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;
    Which hath an operation more divine
    Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
    All the commerce that you have had with Troy
    As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
    And better would it fit Achilles much
    To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
    But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
    When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
    And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
    'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
    But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
    Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;
    The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.

    Exit

PATROCLUS

    To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:
    A woman impudent and mannish grown
    Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
    In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
    They think my little stomach to the war
    And your great love to me restrains you thus:
    Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
    Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
    And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
    Be shook to air.

ACHILLES

    Shall Ajax fight with Hector?

PATROCLUS

    Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.

ACHILLES

    I see my reputation is at stake
    My fame is shrewdly gored.

PATROCLUS

    O, then, beware;
    Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
    Omission to do what is necessary
    Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
    And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
    Even then when we sit idly in the sun.

ACHILLES

    Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:
    I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
    To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
    To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,
    An appetite that I am sick withal,
    To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
    To talk with him and to behold his visage,
    Even to my full of view.

    Enter THERSITES
    A labour saved!

THERSITES

    A wonder!

ACHILLES

    What?

THERSITES

    Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.

ACHILLES

    How so?

THERSITES

    He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so
    prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
    raves in saying nothing.

ACHILLES

    How can that be?

THERSITES

    Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride
    and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
    arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
    bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
    say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'
    and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire
    in a flint, which will not show without knocking.
    The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his
    neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in
    vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,
    Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think
    you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
    grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.
    A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
    sides, like a leather jerkin.

ACHILLES

    Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.

THERSITES

    Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not
    answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his
    tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let
    Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the
    pageant of Ajax.

ACHILLES

    To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the
    valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
    to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure
    safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
    and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
    captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,
    et cetera. Do this.

PATROCLUS

    Jove bless great Ajax!

THERSITES

    Hum!

PATROCLUS

    I come from the worthy Achilles,--

THERSITES

    Ha!

PATROCLUS

    Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--

THERSITES

    Hum!

PATROCLUS

    And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.

THERSITES

    Agamemnon!

PATROCLUS

    Ay, my lord.

THERSITES

    Ha!

PATROCLUS

    What say you to't?

THERSITES

    God b' wi' you, with all my heart.

PATROCLUS

    Your answer, sir.

THERSITES

    If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will
    go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me
    ere he has me.

PATROCLUS

    Your answer, sir.

THERSITES

    Fare you well, with all my heart.

ACHILLES

    Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?

THERSITES

    No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in
    him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know
    not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo
    get his sinews to make catlings on.

ACHILLES

    Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.

THERSITES

    Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more
    capable creature.

ACHILLES

    My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;
    And I myself see not the bottom of it.

    Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS

THERSITES

    Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,
    that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a
    tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.

    Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. Troy. A street.

    Enter, from one side, AENEAS, and Servant with a torch; from the other, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, DIOMEDES, and others, with torches

PARIS

    See, ho! who is that there?

DEIPHOBUS

    It is the Lord AEneas.

AENEAS

    Is the prince there in person?
    Had I so good occasion to lie long
    As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
    Should rob my bed-mate of my company.

DIOMEDES

    That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.

PARIS

    A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--
    Witness the process of your speech, wherein
    You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
    Did haunt you in the field.

AENEAS

    Health to you, valiant sir,
    During all question of the gentle truce;
    But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance
    As heart can think or courage execute.

DIOMEDES

    The one and other Diomed embraces.
    Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!
    But when contention and occasion meet,
    By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
    With all my force, pursuit and policy.

AENEAS

    And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly
    With his face backward. In humane gentleness,
    Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,
    Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,
    No man alive can love in such a sort
    The thing he means to kill more excellently.

DIOMEDES

    We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,
    If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
    A thousand complete courses of the sun!
    But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,
    With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!

AENEAS

    We know each other well.

DIOMEDES

    We do; and long to know each other worse.

PARIS

    This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
    The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
    What business, lord, so early?

AENEAS

    I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.

PARIS

    His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
    To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
    For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:
    Let's have your company, or, if you please,
    Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
    Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--
    My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
    Rouse him and give him note of our approach.
    With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
    We shall be much unwelcome.

AENEAS

    That I assure you:
    Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
    Than Cressid borne from Troy.

PARIS

    There is no help;
    The bitter disposition of the time
    Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.

AENEAS

    Good morrow, all.

    Exit with Servant

PARIS

    And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,
    Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,
    Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,
    Myself or Menelaus?

DIOMEDES

    Both alike:
    He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,
    Not making any scruple of her soilure,
    With such a hell of pain and world of charge,
    And you as well to keep her, that defend her,
    Not palating the taste of her dishonour,
    With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
    He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up
    The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
    You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
    Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
    Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;
    But he as he, the heavier for a whore.

PARIS

    You are too bitter to your countrywoman.

DIOMEDES

    She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:
    For every false drop in her bawdy veins
    A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
    Of her contaminated carrion weight,
    A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,
    She hath not given so many good words breath
    As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.

PARIS

    Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
    Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:
    But we in silence hold this virtue well,
    We'll but commend what we intend to sell.
    Here lies our way.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. Court of Pandarus' house.

    Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA

TROILUS

    Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.

CRESSIDA

    Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;
    He shall unbolt the gates.

TROILUS

    Trouble him not;
    To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,
    And give as soft attachment to thy senses
    As infants' empty of all thought!

CRESSIDA

    Good morrow, then.

TROILUS

    I prithee now, to bed.

CRESSIDA

    Are you a-weary of me?

TROILUS

    O Cressida! but that the busy day,
    Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,
    And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
    I would not from thee.

CRESSIDA

    Night hath been too brief.

TROILUS

    Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
    As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love
    With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
    You will catch cold, and curse me.

CRESSIDA

    Prithee, tarry:
    You men will never tarry.
    O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
    And then you would have tarried. Hark!
    there's one up.

PANDARUS

    [Within] What, 's all the doors open here?

TROILUS

    It is your uncle.

CRESSIDA

    A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:
    I shall have such a life!

    Enter PANDARUS

PANDARUS

    How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you
    maid! where's my cousin Cressid?

CRESSIDA

    Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!
    You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.

PANDARUS

    To do what? to do what? let her say
    what: what have I brought you to do?

CRESSIDA

    Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
    Nor suffer others.

PANDARUS

    Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!
    hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty
    man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!

CRESSIDA

    Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!

    Knocking within
    Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.
    My lord, come you again into my chamber:
    You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.

TROILUS

    Ha, ha!

CRESSIDA

    Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.

    Knocking within
    How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:
    I would not for half Troy have you seen here.

    Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA

PANDARUS

    Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat
    down the door? How now! what's the matter?

    Enter AENEAS

AENEAS

    Good morrow, lord, good morrow.

PANDARUS

    Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,
    I knew you not: what news with you so early?

AENEAS

    Is not Prince Troilus here?

PANDARUS

    Here! what should he do here?

AENEAS

    Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:
    It doth import him much to speak with me.

PANDARUS

    Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll
    be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What
    should he do here?

AENEAS

    Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong
    ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be
    false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go
    fetch him hither; go.

    Re-enter TROILUS

TROILUS

    How now! what's the matter?

AENEAS

    My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
    My matter is so rash: there is at hand
    Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,
    The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
    Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
    Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
    We must give up to Diomedes' hand
    The Lady Cressida.

TROILUS

    Is it so concluded?

AENEAS

    By Priam and the general state of Troy:
    They are at hand and ready to effect it.

TROILUS

    How my achievements mock me!
    I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,
    We met by chance; you did not find me here.

AENEAS

    Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature
    Have not more gift in taciturnity.

    Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS

PANDARUS

    Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil
    take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a
    plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!

    Re-enter CRESSIDA

CRESSIDA

    How now! what's the matter? who was here?

PANDARUS

    Ah, ah!

CRESSIDA

    Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!
    Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?

PANDARUS

    Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!

CRESSIDA

    O the gods! what's the matter?

PANDARUS

    Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been
    born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor
    gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!

CRESSIDA

    Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,
    what's the matter?

PANDARUS

    Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou
    art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,
    and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;
    'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.

CRESSIDA

    O you immortal gods! I will not go.

PANDARUS

    Thou must.

CRESSIDA

    I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;
    I know no touch of consanguinity;
    No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me
    As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!
    Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
    If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
    Do to this body what extremes you can;
    But the strong base and building of my love
    Is as the very centre of the earth,
    Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--

PANDARUS

    Do, do.

CRESSIDA

    Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,
    Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
    With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. Street before Pandarus' house.

    Enter PARIS, TROILUS, AENEAS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR, and DIOMEDES

PARIS

    It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd
    Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
    Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
    Tell you the lady what she is to do,
    And haste her to the purpose.

TROILUS

    Walk into her house;
    I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:
    And to his hand when I deliver her,
    Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
    A priest there offering to it his own heart.

    Exit

PARIS

    I know what 'tis to love;
    And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
    Please you walk in, my lords.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. Pandarus' house.

    Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDA

PANDARUS

    Be moderate, be moderate.

CRESSIDA

    Why tell you me of moderation?
    The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
    And violenteth in a sense as strong
    As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?
    If I could temporize with my affection,
    Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,
    The like allayment could I give my grief.
    My love admits no qualifying dross;
    No more my grief, in such a precious loss.

PANDARUS

    Here, here, here he comes.

    Enter TROILUS
    Ah, sweet ducks!

CRESSIDA

    O Troilus! Troilus!

    Embracing him

PANDARUS

    What a pair of spectacles is here!
    Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,
    '--O heart, heavy heart,
    Why sigh'st thou without breaking?
    where he answers again,
    'Because thou canst not ease thy smart
    By friendship nor by speaking.'
    There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away
    nothing, for we may live to have need of such a
    verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?

TROILUS

    Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,
    That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,
    More bright in zeal than the devotion which
    Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.

CRESSIDA

    Have the gods envy?

PANDARUS

    Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.

CRESSIDA

    And is it true that I must go from Troy?

TROILUS

    A hateful truth.

CRESSIDA

    What, and from Troilus too?

TROILUS

    From Troy and Troilus.

CRESSIDA

    Is it possible?

TROILUS

    And suddenly; where injury of chance
    Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
    All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
    Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
    Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows
    Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:
    We two, that with so many thousand sighs
    Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
    With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
    Injurious time now with a robber's haste
    Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:
    As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
    With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,
    He fumbles up into a lose adieu,
    And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
    Distasted with the salt of broken tears.

AENEAS

    [Within] My lord, is the lady ready?

TROILUS

    Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
    Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
    Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.

PANDARUS

    Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or
    my heart will be blown up by the root.

    Exit

CRESSIDA

    I must then to the Grecians?

TROILUS

    No remedy.

CRESSIDA

    A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
    When shall we see again?

TROILUS

    Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--

CRESSIDA

    I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?

TROILUS

    Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
    For it is parting from us:
    I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,
    For I will throw my glove to Death himself,
    That there's no maculation in thy heart:
    But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in
    My sequent protestation; be thou true,
    And I will see thee.

CRESSIDA

    O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers
    As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.

TROILUS

    And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.

CRESSIDA

    And you this glove. When shall I see you?

TROILUS

    I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,
    To give thee nightly visitation.
    But yet be true.

CRESSIDA

    O heavens! 'be true' again!

TROILUS

    Hear while I speak it, love:
    The Grecian youths are full of quality;
    They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,
    Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:
    How novelty may move, and parts with person,
    Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--
    Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--
    Makes me afeard.

CRESSIDA

    O heavens! you love me not.

TROILUS

    Die I a villain, then!
    In this I do not call your faith in question
    So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,
    Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
    Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,
    To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:
    But I can tell that in each grace of these
    There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
    That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.

CRESSIDA

    Do you think I will?

TROILUS

    No.
    But something may be done that we will not:
    And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,
    When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,
    Presuming on their changeful potency.

AENEAS

    [Within] Nay, good my lord,--

TROILUS

    Come, kiss; and let us part.

PARIS

    [Within] Brother Troilus!

TROILUS

    Good brother, come you hither;
    And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.

CRESSIDA

    My lord, will you be true?

TROILUS

    Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:
    Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
    I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
    Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
    With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
    Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
    Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.

    Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS, and DIOMEDES
    Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady
    Which for Antenor we deliver you:
    At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,
    And by the way possess thee what she is.
    Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
    If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
    Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe
    As Priam is in Ilion.

DIOMEDES

    Fair Lady Cressid,
    So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
    The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
    Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed
    You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.

TROILUS

    Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,
    To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
    In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,
    She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
    As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
    I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;
    For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,
    Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
    I'll cut thy throat.

DIOMEDES

    O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:
    Let me be privileged by my place and message,
    To be a speaker free; when I am hence
    I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,
    I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
    She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'
    I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'

TROILUS

    Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,
    This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
    Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
    To our own selves bend we our needful talk.

    Exeunt TROILUS, CRESSIDA, and DIOMEDES

    Trumpet within

PARIS

    Hark! Hector's trumpet.

AENEAS

    How have we spent this morning!
    The prince must think me tardy and remiss,
    That sore to ride before him to the field.

PARIS

    'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.

DEIPHOBUS

    Let us make ready straight.

AENEAS

    Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,
    Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
    The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
    On his fair worth and single chivalry.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. The Grecian camp. Lists set out.

    Enter AJAX, armed; AGAMEMNON, ACHILLES, PATROCLUS, MENELAUS, ULYSSES, NESTOR, and others

AGAMEMNON

    Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
    Anticipating time with starting courage.
    Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
    Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air
    May pierce the head of the great combatant
    And hale him hither.

AJAX

    Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
    Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
    Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
    Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:
    Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;
    Thou blow'st for Hector.

    Trumpet sounds

ULYSSES

    No trumpet answers.

ACHILLES

    'Tis but early days.

AGAMEMNON

    Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?

ULYSSES

    'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;
    He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
    In aspiration lifts him from the earth.

    Enter DIOMEDES, with CRESSIDA

AGAMEMNON

    Is this the Lady Cressid?

DIOMEDES

    Even she.

AGAMEMNON

    Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.

NESTOR

    Our general doth salute you with a kiss.

ULYSSES

    Yet is the kindness but particular;
    'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.

NESTOR

    And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
    So much for Nestor.

ACHILLES

    I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:
    Achilles bids you welcome.

MENELAUS

    I had good argument for kissing once.

PATROCLUS

    But that's no argument for kissing now;
    For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
    And parted thus you and your argument.

ULYSSES

    O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!
    For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.

PATROCLUS

    The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:
    Patroclus kisses you.

MENELAUS

    O, this is trim!

PATROCLUS

    Paris and I kiss evermore for him.

MENELAUS

    I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.

CRESSIDA

    In kissing, do you render or receive?

PATROCLUS

    Both take and give.

CRESSIDA

    I'll make my match to live,
    The kiss you take is better than you give;
    Therefore no kiss.

MENELAUS

    I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.

CRESSIDA

    You're an odd man; give even or give none.

MENELAUS

    An odd man, lady! every man is odd.

CRESSIDA

    No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,
    That you are odd, and he is even with you.

MENELAUS

    You fillip me o' the head.

CRESSIDA

    No, I'll be sworn.

ULYSSES

    It were no match, your nail against his horn.
    May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?

CRESSIDA

    You may.

ULYSSES

    I do desire it.

CRESSIDA

    Why, beg, then.

ULYSSES

    Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,
    When Helen is a maid again, and his.

CRESSIDA

    I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.

ULYSSES

    Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.

DIOMEDES

    Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.

    Exit with CRESSIDA

NESTOR

    A woman of quick sense.

ULYSSES

    Fie, fie upon her!
    There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
    Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
    At every joint and motive of her body.
    O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,
    That give accosting welcome ere it comes,
    And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
    To every ticklish reader! set them down
    For sluttish spoils of opportunity
    And daughters of the game.

    Trumpet within

ALL

    The Trojans' trumpet.

AGAMEMNON

    Yonder comes the troop.

    Enter HECTOR, armed; AENEAS, TROILUS, and other Trojans, with Attendants

AENEAS

    Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
    To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
    A victor shall be known? will you the knights
    Shall to the edge of all extremity
    Pursue each other, or shall be divided
    By any voice or order of the field?
    Hector bade ask.

AGAMEMNON

    Which way would Hector have it?

AENEAS

    He cares not; he'll obey conditions.

ACHILLES

    'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,
    A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
    The knight opposed.

AENEAS

    If not Achilles, sir,
    What is your name?

ACHILLES

    If not Achilles, nothing.

AENEAS

    Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:
    In the extremity of great and little,
    Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;
    The one almost as infinite as all,
    The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
    And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
    This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
    In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
    Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
    This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.

ACHILLES

    A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.

    Re-enter DIOMEDES

AGAMEMNON

    Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
    Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
    Consent upon the order of their fight,
    So be it; either to the uttermost,
    Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
    Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.

    AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists

ULYSSES

    They are opposed already.

AGAMEMNON

    What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?

ULYSSES

    The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,
    Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
    Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
    Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:
    His heart and hand both open and both free;
    For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;
    Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
    Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;
    Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
    For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
    To tender objects, but he in heat of action
    Is more vindicative than jealous love:
    They call him Troilus, and on him erect
    A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
    Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth
    Even to his inches, and with private soul
    Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.

    Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight

AGAMEMNON

    They are in action.

NESTOR

    Now, Ajax, hold thine own!

TROILUS

    Hector, thou sleep'st;
    Awake thee!

AGAMEMNON

    His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!

DIOMEDES

    You must no more.

    Trumpets cease

AENEAS

    Princes, enough, so please you.

AJAX

    I am not warm yet; let us fight again.

DIOMEDES

    As Hector pleases.

HECTOR

    Why, then will I no more:
    Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
    A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
    The obligation of our blood forbids
    A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
    Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
    That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,
    And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg
    All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
    Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
    Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,
    Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
    Wherein my sword had not impressure made
    Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
    That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
    My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
    Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:
    By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
    Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
    Cousin, all honour to thee!

AJAX

    I thank thee, Hector
    Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
    I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
    A great addition earned in thy death.

HECTOR

    Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
    On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
    Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
    A thought of added honour torn from Hector.

AENEAS

    There is expectance here from both the sides,
    What further you will do.

HECTOR

    We'll answer it;
    The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.

AJAX

    If I might in entreaties find success--
    As seld I have the chance--I would desire
    My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.

DIOMEDES

    'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles
    Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.

HECTOR

    AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
    And signify this loving interview
    To the expecters of our Trojan part;
    Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
    I will go eat with thee and see your knights.

AJAX

    Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.

HECTOR

    The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
    But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes
    Shall find him by his large and portly size.

AGAMEMNON

    Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
    That would be rid of such an enemy;
    But that's no welcome: understand more clear,
    What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
    And formless ruin of oblivion;
    But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
    Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
    Bids thee, with most divine integrity,
    From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.

HECTOR

    I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.

AGAMEMNON

    [To TROILUS] My well-famed lord of Troy, no
    less to you.

MENELAUS

    Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:
    You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.

HECTOR

    Who must we answer?

AENEAS

    The noble Menelaus.

HECTOR

    O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
    Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;
    Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
    She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.

MENELAUS

    Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.

HECTOR

    O, pardon; I offend.

NESTOR

    I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft
    Labouring for destiny make cruel way
    Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,
    As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
    Despising many forfeits and subduements,
    When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,
    Not letting it decline on the declined,
    That I have said to some my standers by
    'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
    And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
    When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,
    Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;
    But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
    I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
    And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;
    But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
    Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;
    And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.

AENEAS

    'Tis the old Nestor.

HECTOR

    Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
    That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
    Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.

NESTOR

    I would my arms could match thee in contention,
    As they contend with thee in courtesy.

HECTOR

    I would they could.

NESTOR

    Ha!
    By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.
    Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.

ULYSSES

    I wonder now how yonder city stands
    When we have here her base and pillar by us.

HECTOR

    I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
    Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
    Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
    In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.

ULYSSES

    Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:
    My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
    For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
    Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
    Must kiss their own feet.

HECTOR

    I must not believe you:
    There they stand yet, and modestly I think,
    The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
    A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
    And that old common arbitrator, Time,
    Will one day end it.

ULYSSES

    So to him we leave it.
    Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:
    After the general, I beseech you next
    To feast with me and see me at my tent.

ACHILLES

    I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
    Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
    I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,
    And quoted joint by joint.

HECTOR

    Is this Achilles?

ACHILLES

    I am Achilles.

HECTOR

    Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.

ACHILLES

    Behold thy fill.

HECTOR

    Nay, I have done already.

ACHILLES

    Thou art too brief: I will the second time,
    As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.

HECTOR

    O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;
    But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
    Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?

ACHILLES

    Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
    Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?
    That I may give the local wound a name
    And make distinct the very breach whereout
    Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!

HECTOR

    It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
    To answer such a question: stand again:
    Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
    As to prenominate in nice conjecture
    Where thou wilt hit me dead?

ACHILLES

    I tell thee, yea.

HECTOR

    Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
    I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;
    For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;
    But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
    I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
    You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
    His insolence draws folly from my lips;
    But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,
    Or may I never--

AJAX

    Do not chafe thee, cousin:
    And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
    Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
    You may have every day enough of Hector
    If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,
    Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.

HECTOR

    I pray you, let us see you in the field:
    We have had pelting wars, since you refused
    The Grecians' cause.

ACHILLES

    Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
    To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
    To-night all friends.

HECTOR

    Thy hand upon that match.

AGAMEMNON

    First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
    There in the full convive we: afterwards,
    As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
    Concur together, severally entreat him.
    Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,
    That this great soldier may his welcome know.

    Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES

TROILUS

    My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,
    In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?

ULYSSES

    At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:
    There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;
    Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,
    But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
    On the fair Cressid.

TROILUS

    Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
    After we part from Agamemnon's tent,
    To bring me thither?

ULYSSES

    You shall command me, sir.
    As gentle tell me, of what honour was
    This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
    That wails her absence?

TROILUS

    O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars
    A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
    She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:
    But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.

    Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS

ACHILLES

    I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,
    Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.
    Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.

PATROCLUS

    Here comes Thersites.

    Enter THERSITES

ACHILLES

    How now, thou core of envy!
    Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?

THERSITES

    Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol
    of idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.

ACHILLES

    From whence, fragment?

THERSITES

    Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.

PATROCLUS

    Who keeps the tent now?

THERSITES

    The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.

PATROCLUS

    Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?

THERSITES

    Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk:
    thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.

PATROCLUS

    Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?

THERSITES

    Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases
    of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,
    loads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold
    palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing
    lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,
    limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the
    rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take
    again such preposterous discoveries!

PATROCLUS

    Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest
    thou to curse thus?

THERSITES

    Do I curse thee?

PATROCLUS

    Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson
    indistinguishable cur, no.

THERSITES

    No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle
    immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet
    flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's
    purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered
    with such waterflies, diminutives of nature!

PATROCLUS

    Out, gall!

THERSITES

    Finch-egg!

ACHILLES

    My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite
    From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
    Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
    A token from her daughter, my fair love,
    Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
    An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:
    Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;
    My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
    Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:
    This night in banqueting must all be spent.
    Away, Patroclus!

    Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS

THERSITES

    With too much blood and too little brain, these two
    may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too
    little blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.
    Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one
    that loves quails; but he has not so much brain as
    earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter
    there, his brother, the bull,--the primitive statue,
    and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty
    shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's
    leg,--to what form but that he is, should wit larded
    with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?
    To an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to
    an ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a
    dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an
    owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would
    not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire
    against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I
    were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse
    of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!
    spirits and fires!

    Enter HECTOR, TROILUS, AJAX, AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, MENELAUS, and DIOMEDES, with lights

AGAMEMNON

    We go wrong, we go wrong.

AJAX

    No, yonder 'tis;
    There, where we see the lights.

HECTOR

    I trouble you.

AJAX

    No, not a whit.

ULYSSES

    Here comes himself to guide you.

    Re-enter ACHILLES

ACHILLES

    Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.

AGAMEMNON

    So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.
    Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.

HECTOR

    Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.

MENELAUS

    Good night, my lord.

HECTOR

    Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.

THERSITES

    Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,
    sweet sewer.

ACHILLES

    Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
    That go or tarry.

AGAMEMNON

    Good night.

    Exeunt AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS

ACHILLES

    Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,
    Keep Hector company an hour or two.

DIOMEDES

    I cannot, lord; I have important business,
    The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.

HECTOR

    Give me your hand.

ULYSSES

    [Aside to TROILUS] Follow his torch; he goes to
    Calchas' tent:
    I'll keep you company.

TROILUS

    Sweet sir, you honour me.

HECTOR

    And so, good night.

    Exit DIOMEDES; ULYSSES and TROILUS following

ACHILLES

    Come, come, enter my tent.

    Exeunt ACHILLES, HECTOR, AJAX, and NESTOR

THERSITES

    That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most
    unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers
    than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend
    his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:
    but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it
    is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun
    borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
    word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than
    not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan
    drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll
    after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!

    Exit

SCENE II. The same. Before Calchas' tent.

    Enter DIOMEDES

DIOMEDES

    What, are you up here, ho? speak.

CALCHAS

    [Within] Who calls?

DIOMEDES

    Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?

CALCHAS

    [Within] She comes to you.

    Enter TROILUS and ULYSSES, at a distance; after them, THERSITES

ULYSSES

    Stand where the torch may not discover us.

    Enter CRESSIDA

TROILUS

    Cressid comes forth to him.

DIOMEDES

    How now, my charge!

CRESSIDA

    Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.

    Whispers

TROILUS

    Yea, so familiar!

ULYSSES

    She will sing any man at first sight.

THERSITES

    And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;
    she's noted.

DIOMEDES

    Will you remember?

CRESSIDA

    Remember! yes.

DIOMEDES

    Nay, but do, then;
    And let your mind be coupled with your words.

TROILUS

    What should she remember?

ULYSSES

    List.

CRESSIDA

    Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.

THERSITES

    Roguery!

DIOMEDES

    Nay, then,--

CRESSIDA

    I'll tell you what,--

DIOMEDES

    Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.

CRESSIDA

    In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?

THERSITES

    A juggling trick,--to be secretly open.

DIOMEDES

    What did you swear you would bestow on me?

CRESSIDA

    I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;
    Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.

DIOMEDES

    Good night.

TROILUS

    Hold, patience!

ULYSSES

    How now, Trojan!

CRESSIDA

    Diomed,--

DIOMEDES

    No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.

TROILUS

    Thy better must.

CRESSIDA

    Hark, one word in your ear.

TROILUS

    O plague and madness!

ULYSSES

    You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray you,
    Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
    To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;
    The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.

TROILUS

    Behold, I pray you!

ULYSSES

    Nay, good my lord, go off:
    You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.

TROILUS

    I pray thee, stay.

ULYSSES

    You have not patience; come.

TROILUS

    I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's torments
    I will not speak a word!

DIOMEDES

    And so, good night.

CRESSIDA

    Nay, but you part in anger.

TROILUS

    Doth that grieve thee?
    O wither'd truth!

ULYSSES

    Why, how now, lord!

TROILUS

    By Jove,
    I will be patient.

CRESSIDA

    Guardian!--why, Greek!

DIOMEDES

    Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.

CRESSIDA

    In faith, I do not: come hither once again.

ULYSSES

    You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?
    You will break out.

TROILUS

    She strokes his cheek!

ULYSSES

    Come, come.

TROILUS

    Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
    There is between my will and all offences
    A guard of patience: stay a little while.

THERSITES

    How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and
    potato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!

DIOMEDES

    But will you, then?

CRESSIDA

    In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.

DIOMEDES

    Give me some token for the surety of it.

CRESSIDA

    I'll fetch you one.

    Exit

ULYSSES

    You have sworn patience.

TROILUS

    Fear me not, sweet lord;
    I will not be myself, nor have cognition
    Of what I feel: I am all patience.

    Re-enter CRESSIDA

THERSITES

    Now the pledge; now, now, now!

CRESSIDA

    Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.

TROILUS

    O beauty! where is thy faith?

ULYSSES

    My lord,--

TROILUS

    I will be patient; outwardly I will.

CRESSIDA

    You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.
    He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.

DIOMEDES

    Whose was't?

CRESSIDA

    It is no matter, now I have't again.
    I will not meet with you to-morrow night:
    I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.

THERSITES

    Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!

DIOMEDES

    I shall have it.

CRESSIDA

    What, this?

DIOMEDES

    Ay, that.

CRESSIDA

    O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
    Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
    Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
    And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,
    As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;
    He that takes that doth take my heart withal.

DIOMEDES

    I had your heart before, this follows it.

TROILUS

    I did swear patience.

CRESSIDA

    You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;
    I'll give you something else.

DIOMEDES

    I will have this: whose was it?

CRESSIDA

    It is no matter.

DIOMEDES

    Come, tell me whose it was.

CRESSIDA

    'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
    But, now you have it, take it.

DIOMEDES

    Whose was it?

CRESSIDA

    By all Diana's waiting-women yond,
    And by herself, I will not tell you whose.

DIOMEDES

    To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
    And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.

TROILUS

    Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,
    It should be challenged.

CRESSIDA

    Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not;
    I will not keep my word.

DIOMEDES

    Why, then, farewell;
    Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.

CRESSIDA

    You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
    But it straight starts you.

DIOMEDES

    I do not like this fooling.

THERSITES

    Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.

DIOMEDES

    What, shall I come? the hour?

CRESSIDA

    Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued.

DIOMEDES

    Farewell till then.

CRESSIDA

    Good night: I prithee, come.

    Exit DIOMEDES
    Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee
    But with my heart the other eye doth see.
    Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,
    The error of our eye directs our mind:
    What error leads must err; O, then conclude
    Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.

    Exit

THERSITES

    A proof of strength she could not publish more,
    Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'

ULYSSES

    All's done, my lord.

TROILUS

    It is.

ULYSSES

    Why stay we, then?

TROILUS

    To make a recordation to my soul
    Of every syllable that here was spoke.
    But if I tell how these two did co-act,
    Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
    Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
    An esperance so obstinately strong,
    That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,
    As if those organs had deceptious functions,
    Created only to calumniate.
    Was Cressid here?

ULYSSES

    I cannot conjure, Trojan.

TROILUS

    She was not, sure.

ULYSSES

    Most sure she was.

TROILUS

    Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.

ULYSSES

    Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.

TROILUS

    Let it not be believed for womanhood!
    Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage
    To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,
    For depravation, to square the general sex
    By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.

ULYSSES

    What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?

TROILUS

    Nothing at all, unless that this were she.

THERSITES

    Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?

TROILUS

    This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:
    If beauty have a soul, this is not she;
    If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,
    If sanctimony be the gods' delight,
    If there be rule in unity itself,
    This is not she. O madness of discourse,
    That cause sets up with and against itself!
    Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt
    Without perdition, and loss assume all reason
    Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.
    Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
    Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
    Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
    And yet the spacious breadth of this division
    Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
    As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
    Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
    Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:
    Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;
    The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;
    And with another knot, five-finger-tied,
    The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
    The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics
    Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.

ULYSSES

    May worthy Troilus be half attach'd
    With that which here his passion doth express?

TROILUS

    Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well
    In characters as red as Mars his heart
    Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy
    With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
    Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,
    So much by weight hate I her Diomed:
    That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;
    Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,
    My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout
    Which shipmen do the hurricano call,
    Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,
    Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear
    In his descent than shall my prompted sword
    Falling on Diomed.

THERSITES

    He'll tickle it for his concupy.

TROILUS

    O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!
    Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,
    And they'll seem glorious.

ULYSSES

    O, contain yourself
    Your passion draws ears hither.

    Enter AENEAS

AENEAS

    I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:
    Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
    Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.

TROILUS

    Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu.
    Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,
    Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!

ULYSSES

    I'll bring you to the gates.

TROILUS

    Accept distracted thanks.

    Exeunt TROILUS, AENEAS, and ULYSSES

THERSITES

    Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
    croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode.
    Patroclus will give me any thing for the
    intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not
    do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.
    Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing
    else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!

    Exit

SCENE III. Troy. Before Priam's palace.

    Enter HECTOR and ANDROMACHE

ANDROMACHE

    When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,
    To stop his ears against admonishment?
    Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.

HECTOR

    You train me to offend you; get you in:
    By all the everlasting gods, I'll go!

ANDROMACHE

    My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.

HECTOR

    No more, I say.

    Enter CASSANDRA

CASSANDRA

    Where is my brother Hector?

ANDROMACHE

    Here, sister; arm'd, and bloody in intent.
    Consort with me in loud and dear petition,
    Pursue we him on knees; for I have dream'd
    Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
    Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.

CASSANDRA

    O, 'tis true.

HECTOR

    Ho! bid my trumpet sound!

CASSANDRA

    No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.

HECTOR

    Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.

CASSANDRA

    The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
    They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd
    Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.

ANDROMACHE

    O, be persuaded! do not count it holy
    To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,
    For we would give much, to use violent thefts,
    And rob in the behalf of charity.

CASSANDRA

    It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
    But vows to every purpose must not hold:
    Unarm, sweet Hector.

HECTOR

    Hold you still, I say;
    Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:
    Lie every man holds dear; but the brave man
    Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.

    Enter TROILUS
    How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?

ANDROMACHE

    Cassandra, call my father to persuade.

    Exit CASSANDRA

HECTOR

    No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
    I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
    Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
    And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
    Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
    I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.

TROILUS

    Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,
    Which better fits a lion than a man.

HECTOR

    What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it.

TROILUS

    When many times the captive Grecian falls,
    Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,
    You bid them rise, and live.

HECTOR

    O,'tis fair play.

TROILUS

    Fool's play, by heaven, Hector.

HECTOR

    How now! how now!

TROILUS

    For the love of all the gods,
    Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers,
    And when we have our armours buckled on,
    The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,
    Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth.

HECTOR

    Fie, savage, fie!

TROILUS

    Hector, then 'tis wars.

HECTOR

    Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.

TROILUS

    Who should withhold me?
    Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars
    Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;
    Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,
    Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears;
    Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
    Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way,
    But by my ruin.

    Re-enter CASSANDRA, with PRIAM

CASSANDRA

    Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
    He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,
    Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,
    Fall all together.

PRIAM

    Come, Hector, come, go back:
    Thy wife hath dream'd; thy mother hath had visions;
    Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself
    Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
    To tell thee that this day is ominous:
    Therefore, come back.

HECTOR

    AEneas is a-field;
    And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
    Even in the faith of valour, to appear
    This morning to them.

PRIAM

    Ay, but thou shalt not go.

HECTOR

    I must not break my faith.
    You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
    Let me not shame respect; but give me leave
    To take that course by your consent and voice,
    Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.

CASSANDRA

    O Priam, yield not to him!

ANDROMACHE

    Do not, dear father.

HECTOR

    Andromache, I am offended with you:
    Upon the love you bear me, get you in.

    Exit ANDROMACHE

TROILUS

    This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
    Makes all these bodements.

CASSANDRA

    O, farewell, dear Hector!
    Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale!
    Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
    Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out!
    How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
    Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement,
    Like witless antics, one another meet,
    And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!

TROILUS

    Away! away!

CASSANDRA

    Farewell: yet, soft! Hector! take my leave:
    Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.

    Exit

HECTOR

    You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:
    Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,
    Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.

PRIAM

    Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!

    Exeunt severally PRIAM and HECTOR. Alarums

TROILUS

    They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,
    I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.

    Enter PANDARUS

PANDARUS

    Do you hear, my lord? do you hear?

TROILUS

    What now?

PANDARUS

    Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.

TROILUS

    Let me read.

PANDARUS

    A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so
    troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl;
    and what one thing, what another, that I shall
    leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum
    in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones
    that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell what
    to think on't. What says she there?

TROILUS

    Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart:
    The effect doth operate another way.

    Tearing the letter
    Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together.
    My love with words and errors still she feeds;
    But edifies another with her deeds.

    Exeunt severally

SCENE IV. Plains between Troy and the Grecian camp.

    Alarums: excursions. Enter THERSITES

THERSITES

    Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go
    look on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,
    has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's
    sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see
    them meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that
    loves the whore there, might send that Greekish
    whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the
    dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.
    O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty
    swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry
    cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is
    not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in
    policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of
    as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax
    prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm
    to-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim
    barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.
    Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.

    Enter DIOMEDES, TROILUS following

TROILUS

    Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,
    I would swim after.

DIOMEDES

    Thou dost miscall retire:
    I do not fly, but advantageous care
    Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:
    Have at thee!

THERSITES

    Hold thy whore, Grecian!--now for thy whore,
    Trojan!--now the sleeve, now the sleeve!

    Enter HECTOR

HECTOR

    What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?
    Art thou of blood and honour?

THERSITES

    No, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:
    a very filthy rogue.

HECTOR

    I do believe thee: live.

    Exit

THERSITES

    God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a
    plague break thy neck for frightening me! What's
    become of the wenching rogues? I think they have

    miracle: yet, in a sort, lechery eats itself.
    I'll seek them.

    Enter DIOMEDES and a Servant

DIOMEDES

    Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;
    Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid:

    And am her knight by proof.

Servant

    Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon
    Hath Doreus prisoner,
    And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,
    Upon the pashed corses of the kings
    Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,
    Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,
    Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes
    Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary
    Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,
    To reinforcement, or we perish all.

NESTOR

    Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles;
    And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.
    There is a thousand Hectors in the field:
    Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,
    And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
    And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls
    Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
    And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
    Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:
    Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,
    Dexterity so obeying appetite
    That what he will he does, and does so much
    That proof is call'd impossibility.

    That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,
    Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend
    And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,
    Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day
    Mad and fantastic execution,
    Engaging and redeeming of himself
    With such a careless force and forceless care
    As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,

    Empale him with your weapons round about;
    In fellest manner execute your aims.
    Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:
    It is decreed Hector the great must die.

    Exeunt

    Enter MENELAUS and PARIS, fighting: then THERSITES

THERSITES

    The cuckold and the cuckold-maker are at it. Now,
    bull! now, dog! 'Loo, Paris, 'loo! now my double-
    henned sparrow! 'loo, Paris, 'loo! The bull has the
    game: ware horns, ho!

    Exeunt PARIS and MENELAUS

    Enter MARGARELON

MARGARELON

    Turn, slave, and fight.

THERSITES

    What art thou?

MARGARELON

    A bastard son of Priam's.

THERSITES

    I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a bastard
    begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard
    in valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will
    not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard?
    Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the
    son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment:
    farewell, bastard.

    Exit

MARGARELON

    The devil take thee, coward!

    Exit

SCENE VIII. Another part of the plains.

    Enter HECTOR

HECTOR

    Most putrefied core, so fair without,
    Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.
    Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
    Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.

    Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield behind him

    Enter ACHILLES and Myrmidons

ACHILLES

    Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set;
    How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:
    Even with the vail and darking of the sun,
    To close the day up, Hector's life is done.

HECTOR

    I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.

ACHILLES

    Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.

    HECTOR falls
    So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!
    Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
    On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
    'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'

    A retreat sounded
    Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.

MYRMIDONS

    The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.

ACHILLES

    The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,
    And, stickler-like, the armies separates.
    My half-supp'd sword, that frankly would have fed,
    Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.

    Sheathes his sword
    Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;
    Along the field I will the Trojan trail.

    Exeunt

SCENE IX. Another part of the plains.

    Enter AGAMEMNON, AJAX, MENELAUS, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and others, marching. Shouts within

AGAMEMNON

    Hark! hark! what shout is that?

NESTOR

    Peace, drums!

    Within
    Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.

DIOMEDES

    The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.

AJAX

    If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
    Great Hector was a man as good as he.

AGAMEMNON

    March patiently along: let one be sent
    To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
    If in his death the gods have us befriended,
    Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.

    Exeunt, marching

SCENE X. Another part of the plains.

    Enter AENEAS and Trojans

AENEAS

    Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:
    Never go home; here starve we out the night.

    Enter TROILUS

TROILUS

    Hector is slain.

ALL

    Hector! the gods forbid!

TROILUS

    He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail,
    In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.
    Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!
    Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
    I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,
    And linger not our sure destructions on!

AENEAS

    My lord, you do discomfort all the host!

TROILUS

    You understand me not that tell me so:
    I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,
    But dare all imminence that gods and men
    Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
    Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
    Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,
    Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:
    There is a word will Priam turn to stone;
    Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,
    Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,
    Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:
    Hector is dead; there is no more to say.
    Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
    Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,
    Let Titan rise as early as he dare,
    I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,
    No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:
    I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
    That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.
    Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:
    Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.

    Exeunt AENEAS and Trojans

    As TROILUS is going out, enter, from the other side, PANDARUS

PANDARUS

    But hear you, hear you!

TROILUS

    Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame
    Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!

    Exit

PANDARUS

    A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world!
    world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!
    O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set
    a-work, and how ill requited! why should our
    endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?
    what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:
    Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,
    Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;
    And being once subdued in armed tail,
    Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
    Good traders in the flesh, set this in your
    painted cloths.
    As many as be here of pander's hall,
    Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;
    Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
    Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.
    Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
    Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
    It should be now, but that my fear is this,
    Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:
    Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,
    And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.

    Exit


Twelfth Night

ACT I
SCENE I. DUKE ORSINO's palace.

    Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords; Musicians attending

DUKE ORSINO

    If music be the food of love, play on;
    Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
    The appetite may sicken, and so die.
    That strain again! it had a dying fall:
    O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
    That breathes upon a bank of violets,
    Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:
    'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
    O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
    That, notwithstanding thy capacity
    Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
    Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
    But falls into abatement and low price,
    Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
    That it alone is high fantastical.

CURIO

    Will you go hunt, my lord?

DUKE ORSINO

    What, Curio?

CURIO

    The hart.

DUKE ORSINO

    Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:
    O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
    Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
    That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
    And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
    E'er since pursue me.

    Enter VALENTINE
    How now! what news from her?

VALENTINE

    So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
    But from her handmaid do return this answer:
    The element itself, till seven years' heat,
    Shall not behold her face at ample view;
    But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
    And water once a day her chamber round
    With eye-offending brine: all this to season
    A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
    And lasting in her sad remembrance.

DUKE ORSINO

    O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
    To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
    How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
    Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
    That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,
    These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
    Her sweet perfections with one self king!
    Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
    Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The sea-coast.

    Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors

VIOLA

    What country, friends, is this?

Captain

    This is Illyria, lady.

VIOLA

    And what should I do in Illyria?
    My brother he is in Elysium.
    Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?

Captain

    It is perchance that you yourself were saved.

VIOLA

    O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.

Captain

    True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
    Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
    When you and those poor number saved with you
    Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
    Most provident in peril, bind himself,
    Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
    To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
    Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
    I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
    So long as I could see.

VIOLA

    For saying so, there's gold:
    Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
    Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
    The like of him. Know'st thou this country?

Captain

    Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
    Not three hours' travel from this very place.

VIOLA

    Who governs here?

Captain

    A noble duke, in nature as in name.

VIOLA

    What is the name?

Captain

    Orsino.

VIOLA

    Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
    He was a bachelor then.

Captain

    And so is now, or was so very late;
    For but a month ago I went from hence,
    And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
    What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
    That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.

VIOLA

    What's she?

Captain

    A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
    That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
    In the protection of his son, her brother,
    Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
    They say, she hath abjured the company
    And sight of men.

VIOLA

    O that I served that lady
    And might not be delivered to the world,
    Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
    What my estate is!

Captain

    That were hard to compass;
    Because she will admit no kind of suit,
    No, not the duke's.

VIOLA

    There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
    And though that nature with a beauteous wall
    Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
    I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
    With this thy fair and outward character.
    I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
    Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
    For such disguise as haply shall become
    The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
    Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
    It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
    And speak to him in many sorts of music
    That will allow me very worth his service.
    What else may hap to time I will commit;
    Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.

Captain

    Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
    When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

VIOLA

    I thank thee: lead me on.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. OLIVIA'S house.

    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA

SIR TOBY BELCH

    What a plague means my niece, to take the death of
    her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.

MARIA

    By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
    nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
    exceptions to your ill hours.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Why, let her except, before excepted.

MARIA

    Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
    limits of order.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
    these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
    these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
    themselves in their own straps.

MARIA

    That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
    my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
    knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?

MARIA

    Ay, he.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.

MARIA

    What's that to the purpose?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.

MARIA

    Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:
    he's a very fool and a prodigal.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
    viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
    word for word without book, and hath all the good
    gifts of nature.

MARIA

    He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that
    he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that
    he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
    hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent
    he would quickly have the gift of a grave.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors
    that say so of him. Who are they?

MARIA

    They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
    her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
    drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
    that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
    o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
    Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.

    Enter SIR ANDREW

SIR ANDREW

    Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Sweet Sir Andrew!

SIR ANDREW

    Bless you, fair shrew.

MARIA

    And you too, sir.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.

SIR ANDREW

    What's that?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    My niece's chambermaid.

SIR ANDREW

    Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.

MARIA

    My name is Mary, sir.

SIR ANDREW

    Good Mistress Mary Accost,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

    You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
    her, woo her, assail her.

SIR ANDREW

    By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
    company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?

MARIA

    Fare you well, gentlemen.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
    never draw sword again.

SIR ANDREW

    An you part so, mistress, I would I might never
    draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have
    fools in hand?

MARIA

    Sir, I have not you by the hand.

SIR ANDREW

    Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.

MARIA

    Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring
    your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.

SIR ANDREW

    Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?

MARIA

    It's dry, sir.

SIR ANDREW

    Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can
    keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?

MARIA

    A dry jest, sir.

SIR ANDREW

    Are you full of them?

MARIA

    Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,
    now I let go your hand, I am barren.

    Exit

SIR TOBY BELCH

    O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
    see thee so put down?

SIR ANDREW

    Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary
    put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
    than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
    great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    No question.

SIR ANDREW

    An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home
    to-morrow, Sir Toby.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Pourquoi, my dear knight?

SIR ANDREW

    What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
    bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
    fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but
    followed the arts!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.

SIR ANDREW

    Why, would that have mended my hair?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.

SIR ANDREW

    But it becomes me well enough, does't not?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I
    hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
    and spin it off.

SIR ANDREW

    Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece
    will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one
    she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
    her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I
    have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,
    man.

SIR ANDREW

    I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
    strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques
    and revels sometimes altogether.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?

SIR ANDREW

    As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
    degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
    with an old man.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?

SIR ANDREW

    Faith, I can cut a caper.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    And I can cut the mutton to't.

SIR ANDREW

    And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
    as any man in Illyria.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
    these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
    take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
    thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
    a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
    so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
    dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
    I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
    leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.

SIR ANDREW

    Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
    flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?

SIR ANDREW

    Taurus! That's sides and heart.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the
    caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.

    Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attire

VALENTINE

    If the duke continue these favours towards you,
    Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
    known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.

VIOLA

    You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
    you call in question the continuance of his love:
    is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?

VALENTINE

    No, believe me.

VIOLA

    I thank you. Here comes the count.

    Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and Attendants

DUKE ORSINO

    Who saw Cesario, ho?

VIOLA

    On your attendance, my lord; here.

DUKE ORSINO

    Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,
    Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
    To thee the book even of my secret soul:
    Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
    Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
    And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
    Till thou have audience.

VIOLA

    Sure, my noble lord,
    If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
    As it is spoke, she never will admit me.

DUKE ORSINO

    Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
    Rather than make unprofited return.

VIOLA

    Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?

DUKE ORSINO

    O, then unfold the passion of my love,
    Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
    It shall become thee well to act my woes;
    She will attend it better in thy youth
    Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.

VIOLA

    I think not so, my lord.

DUKE ORSINO

    Dear lad, believe it;
    For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
    That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
    Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
    Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
    And all is semblative a woman's part.
    I know thy constellation is right apt
    For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
    All, if you will; for I myself am best
    When least in company. Prosper well in this,
    And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
    To call his fortunes thine.

VIOLA

    I'll do my best
    To woo your lady:

    Aside
    yet, a barful strife!
    Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. OLIVIA'S house.

    Enter MARIA and Clown

MARIA

    Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
    not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
    way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.

Clown

    Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this
    world needs to fear no colours.

MARIA

    Make that good.

Clown

    He shall see none to fear.

MARIA

    A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
    saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'

Clown

    Where, good Mistress Mary?

MARIA

    In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.

Clown

    Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those
    that are fools, let them use their talents.

MARIA

    Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,
    to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?

Clown

    Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,
    for turning away, let summer bear it out.

MARIA

    You are resolute, then?

Clown

    Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.

MARIA

    That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both
    break, your gaskins fall.

Clown

    Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if
    Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
    piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.

MARIA

    Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my
    lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.

    Exit

Clown

    Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!
    Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
    prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
    pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
    'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'

    Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO
    God bless thee, lady!

OLIVIA

    Take the fool away.

Clown

    Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.

OLIVIA

    Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:
    besides, you grow dishonest.

Clown

    Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
    will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
    the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
    himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
    he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing
    that's mended is but patched: virtue that
    transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
    amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
    simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
    what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
    calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
    away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.

OLIVIA

    Sir, I bade them take away you.

Clown

    Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non
    facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not
    motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to
    prove you a fool.

OLIVIA

    Can you do it?

Clown

    Dexterously, good madonna.

OLIVIA

    Make your proof.

Clown

    I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse
    of virtue, answer me.

OLIVIA

    Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.

Clown

    Good madonna, why mournest thou?

OLIVIA

    Good fool, for my brother's death.

Clown

    I think his soul is in hell, madonna.

OLIVIA

    I know his soul is in heaven, fool.

Clown

    The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's
    soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.

OLIVIA

    What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?

MALVOLIO

    Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:
    infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
    better fool.

Clown

    God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
    better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
    sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
    word for two pence that you are no fool.

OLIVIA

    How say you to that, Malvolio?

MALVOLIO

    I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
    barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
    with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
    than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
    already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
    him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
    that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better
    than the fools' zanies.

OLIVIA

    Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
    with a distempered appetite. To be generous,
    guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those
    things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
    there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
    nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
    man, though he do nothing but reprove.

Clown

    Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
    speakest well of fools!

    Re-enter MARIA

MARIA

    Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much
    desires to speak with you.

OLIVIA

    From the Count Orsino, is it?

MARIA

    I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.

OLIVIA

    Who of my people hold him in delay?

MARIA

    Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.

OLIVIA

    Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but
    madman: fie on him!

    Exit MARIA
    Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I
    am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.

    Exit MALVOLIO
    Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and
    people dislike it.

Clown

    Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest
    son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
    brains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has a
    most weak pia mater.

    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH

OLIVIA

    By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    A gentleman.

OLIVIA

    A gentleman! what gentleman?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these
    pickle-herring! How now, sot!

Clown

    Good Sir Toby!

OLIVIA

    Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.

OLIVIA

    Ay, marry, what is he?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give
    me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.

    Exit

OLIVIA

    What's a drunken man like, fool?

Clown

    Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one
    draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads
    him; and a third drowns him.

OLIVIA

    Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my
    coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's
    drowned: go, look after him.

Clown

    He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look
    to the madman.

    Exit

    Re-enter MALVOLIO

MALVOLIO

    Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with
    you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to
    understand so much, and therefore comes to speak
    with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to
    have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore
    comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
    lady? he's fortified against any denial.

OLIVIA

    Tell him he shall not speak with me.

MALVOLIO

    Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your
    door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to
    a bench, but he'll speak with you.

OLIVIA

    What kind o' man is he?

MALVOLIO

    Why, of mankind.

OLIVIA

    What manner of man?

MALVOLIO

    Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.

OLIVIA

    Of what personage and years is he?

MALVOLIO

    Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
    a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a
    cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him
    in standing water, between boy and man. He is very
    well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one
    would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.

OLIVIA

    Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.

MALVOLIO

    Gentlewoman, my lady calls.

    Exit

    Re-enter MARIA

OLIVIA

    Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.
    We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.

    Enter VIOLA, and Attendants

VIOLA

    The honourable lady of the house, which is she?

OLIVIA

    Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
    Your will?

VIOLA

    Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I
    pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
    for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
    my speech, for besides that it is excellently well
    penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
    beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
    comptible, even to the least sinister usage.

OLIVIA

    Whence came you, sir?

VIOLA

    I can say little more than I have studied, and that
    question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
    modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
    that I may proceed in my speech.

OLIVIA

    Are you a comedian?

VIOLA

    No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
    of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
    the lady of the house?

OLIVIA

    If I do not usurp myself, I am.

VIOLA

    Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
    yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
    to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
    on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
    the heart of my message.

OLIVIA

    Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.

VIOLA

    Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.

OLIVIA

    It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
    keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
    and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
    than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
    you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of
    moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.

MARIA

    Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.

VIOLA

    No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
    longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet
    lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.

OLIVIA

    Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
    the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.

VIOLA

    It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
    war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
    hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.

OLIVIA

    Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?

VIOLA

    The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
    learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
    would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,
    divinity, to any other's, profanation.

OLIVIA

    Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.

    Exeunt MARIA and Attendants
    Now, sir, what is your text?

VIOLA

    Most sweet lady,--

OLIVIA

    A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
    Where lies your text?

VIOLA

    In Orsino's bosom.

OLIVIA

    In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?

VIOLA

    To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.

OLIVIA

    O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?

VIOLA

    Good madam, let me see your face.

OLIVIA

    Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
    with my face? You are now out of your text: but
    we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
    Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
    not well done?

    Unveiling

VIOLA

    Excellently done, if God did all.

OLIVIA

    'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.

VIOLA

    'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
    Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
    Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
    If you will lead these graces to the grave
    And leave the world no copy.

OLIVIA

    O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give
    out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
    inventoried, and every particle and utensil
    labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
    indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
    them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were
    you sent hither to praise me?

VIOLA

    I see you what you are, you are too proud;
    But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
    My lord and master loves you: O, such love
    Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
    The nonpareil of beauty!

OLIVIA

    How does he love me?

VIOLA

    With adorations, fertile tears,
    With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.

OLIVIA

    Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:
    Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
    Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
    In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
    And in dimension and the shape of nature
    A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
    He might have took his answer long ago.

VIOLA

    If I did love you in my master's flame,
    With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
    In your denial I would find no sense;
    I would not understand it.

OLIVIA

    Why, what would you?

VIOLA

    Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
    And call upon my soul within the house;
    Write loyal cantons of contemned love
    And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
    Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
    And make the babbling gossip of the air
    Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
    Between the elements of air and earth,
    But you should pity me!

OLIVIA

    You might do much.
    What is your parentage?

VIOLA

    Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
    I am a gentleman.

OLIVIA

    Get you to your lord;
    I cannot love him: let him send no more;
    Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
    To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
    I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.

VIOLA

    I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
    My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
    Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
    And let your fervor, like my master's, be
    Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.

    Exit

OLIVIA

    'What is your parentage?'
    'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
    I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;
    Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,
    Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
    soft, soft!
    Unless the master were the man. How now!
    Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
    Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
    With an invisible and subtle stealth
    To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
    What ho, Malvolio!

    Re-enter MALVOLIO

MALVOLIO

    Here, madam, at your service.

OLIVIA

    Run after that same peevish messenger,
    The county's man: he left this ring behind him,
    Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
    Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
    Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:
    If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
    I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.

MALVOLIO

    Madam, I will.

    Exit

OLIVIA

    I do I know not what, and fear to find
    Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
    Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;
    What is decreed must be, and be this so.

    Exit

ACT II
SCENE I. The sea-coast.

    Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN

ANTONIO

    Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?

SEBASTIAN

    By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over
    me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
    distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your
    leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
    recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.
    ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.

SEBASTIAN

    No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
    extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
    touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
    what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
    me in manners the rather to express myself. You
    must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
    which I called Roderigo. My father was that
    Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
    of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
    born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
    would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
    for some hour before you took me from the breach of
    the sea was my sister drowned.

ANTONIO

    Alas the day!

SEBASTIAN

    A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
    me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
    though I could not with such estimable wonder
    overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
    publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but
    call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
    water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.

ANTONIO

    Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.

SEBASTIAN

    O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.

ANTONIO

    If you will not murder me for my love, let me be
    your servant.

SEBASTIAN

    If you will not undo what you have done, that is,
    kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
    Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,
    and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that
    upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
    tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.

    Exit

ANTONIO

    The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
    I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
    Else would I very shortly see thee there.
    But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
    That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.

    Exit

SCENE II. A street.

    Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following

MALVOLIO

    Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?

VIOLA

    Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since
    arrived but hither.

MALVOLIO

    She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
    saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
    She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
    into a desperate assurance she will none of him:
    and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
    come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
    your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.

VIOLA

    She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.

MALVOLIO

    Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her
    will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth
    stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be
    it his that finds it.

    Exit

VIOLA

    I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
    Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
    She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
    That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
    For she did speak in starts distractedly.
    She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
    Invites me in this churlish messenger.
    None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
    I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
    Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
    Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
    Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
    How easy is it for the proper-false
    In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
    Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
    For such as we are made of, such we be.
    How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;
    And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
    And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
    What will become of this? As I am man,
    My state is desperate for my master's love;
    As I am woman,--now alas the day!--
    What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
    O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
    It is too hard a knot for me to untie!

    Exit

SCENE III. OLIVIA's house.

    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after
    midnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculo
    surgere,' thou know'st,--

SIR ANDREW

    Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up
    late is to be up late.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.
    To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is
    early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
    to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the
    four elements?

SIR ANDREW

    Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists
    of eating and drinking.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.
    Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!

    Enter Clown

SIR ANDREW

    Here comes the fool, i' faith.

Clown

    How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture
    of 'we three'?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.

SIR ANDREW

    By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I
    had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,
    and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In
    sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last
    night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the
    Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas
    very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy
    leman: hadst it?

Clown

    I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose
    is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the
    Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.

SIR ANDREW

    Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all
    is done. Now, a song.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.

SIR ANDREW

    There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--

Clown

    Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    A love-song, a love-song.

SIR ANDREW

    Ay, ay: I care not for good life.

Clown

    [Sings]
    O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
    O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,
    That can sing both high and low:
    Trip no further, pretty sweeting;
    Journeys end in lovers meeting,
    Every wise man's son doth know.

SIR ANDREW

    Excellent good, i' faith.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Good, good.

Clown

    [Sings]
    What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
    Present mirth hath present laughter;
    What's to come is still unsure:
    In delay there lies no plenty;
    Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,
    Youth's a stuff will not endure.

SIR ANDREW

    A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    A contagious breath.

SIR ANDREW

    Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
    But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall we
    rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three
    souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?

SIR ANDREW

    An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.

Clown

    By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.

SIR ANDREW

    Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'

Clown

    'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be
    constrained in't to call thee knave, knight.

SIR ANDREW

    'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to
    call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'

Clown

    I shall never begin if I hold my peace.

SIR ANDREW

    Good, i' faith. Come, begin.

    Catch sung

    Enter MARIA

MARIA

    What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady
    have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him
    turn you out of doors, never trust me.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's
    a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not
    I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?
    Tillyvally. Lady!

    Sings
    'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'

Clown

    Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.

SIR ANDREW

    Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do
    I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it
    more natural.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    [Sings] 'O, the twelfth day of December,'--

MARIA

    For the love o' God, peace!

    Enter MALVOLIO

MALVOLIO

    My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye
    no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like
    tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an
    alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your
    coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse
    of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
    time in you?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!

MALVOLIO

    Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me
    tell you, that, though she harbours you as her
    kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If
    you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you
    are welcome to the house; if not, an it would please
    you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid
    you farewell.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'

MARIA

    Nay, good Sir Toby.

Clown

    'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'

MALVOLIO

    Is't even so?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    'But I will never die.'

Clown

    Sir Toby, there you lie.

MALVOLIO

    This is much credit to you.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    'Shall I bid him go?'

Clown

    'What an if you do?'

SIR TOBY BELCH

    'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'

Clown

    'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a
    steward? Dost thou think, because thou art
    virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?

Clown

    Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the
    mouth too.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with
    crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!

MALVOLIO

    Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any
    thing more than contempt, you would not give means
    for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand.

    Exit

MARIA

    Go shake your ears.

SIR ANDREW

    'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's
    a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to
    break promise with him and make a fool of him.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll
    deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.

MARIA

    Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the
    youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is
    much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me
    alone with him: if I do not gull him into a
    nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not
    think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:
    I know I can do it.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.

MARIA

    Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.

SIR ANDREW

    O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,
    dear knight?

SIR ANDREW

    I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason
    good enough.

MARIA

    The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing
    constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,
    that cons state without book and utters it by great
    swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so
    crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is
    his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
    him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find
    notable cause to work.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    What wilt thou do?

MARIA

    I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
    love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape
    of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure
    of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find
    himself most feelingly personated. I can write very
    like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we
    can hardly make distinction of our hands.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Excellent! I smell a device.

SIR ANDREW

    I have't in my nose too.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,
    that they come from my niece, and that she's in
    love with him.

MARIA

    My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.

SIR ANDREW

    And your horse now would make him an ass.

MARIA

    Ass, I doubt not.

SIR ANDREW

    O, 'twill be admirable!

MARIA

    Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will
    work with him. I will plant you two, and let the
    fool make a third, where he shall find the letter:
    observe his construction of it. For this night, to
    bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.

    Exit

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Good night, Penthesilea.

SIR ANDREW

    Before me, she's a good wench.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me:
    what o' that?

SIR ANDREW

    I was adored once too.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for
    more money.

SIR ANDREW

    If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i'
    the end, call me cut.

SIR ANDREW

    If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late
    to go to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. DUKE ORSINO's palace.

    Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others

DUKE ORSINO

    Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
    Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
    That old and antique song we heard last night:
    Methought it did relieve my passion much,
    More than light airs and recollected terms
    Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
    Come, but one verse.

CURIO

    He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.

DUKE ORSINO

    Who was it?

CURIO

    Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady
    Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.

DUKE ORSINO

    Seek him out, and play the tune the while.

    Exit CURIO. Music plays
    Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
    In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
    For such as I am all true lovers are,
    Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
    Save in the constant image of the creature
    That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?

VIOLA

    It gives a very echo to the seat
    Where Love is throned.

DUKE ORSINO

    Thou dost speak masterly:
    My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
    Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
    Hath it not, boy?

VIOLA

    A little, by your favour.

DUKE ORSINO

    What kind of woman is't?

VIOLA

    Of your complexion.

DUKE ORSINO

    She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?

VIOLA

    About your years, my lord.

DUKE ORSINO

    Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
    An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
    So sways she level in her husband's heart:
    For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
    Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
    More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
    Than women's are.

VIOLA

    I think it well, my lord.

DUKE ORSINO

    Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
    Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
    For women are as roses, whose fair flower
    Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.

VIOLA

    And so they are: alas, that they are so;
    To die, even when they to perfection grow!

    Re-enter CURIO and Clown

DUKE ORSINO

    O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
    Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;
    The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
    And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
    Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
    And dallies with the innocence of love,
    Like the old age.

Clown

    Are you ready, sir?

DUKE ORSINO

    Ay; prithee, sing.

    Music
    SONG.

Clown

    Come away, come away, death,
    And in sad cypress let me be laid;
    Fly away, fly away breath;
    I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
    My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
    O, prepare it!
    My part of death, no one so true
    Did share it.
    Not a flower, not a flower sweet
    On my black coffin let there be strown;
    Not a friend, not a friend greet
    My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:
    A thousand thousand sighs to save,
    Lay me, O, where
    Sad true lover never find my grave,
    To weep there!

DUKE ORSINO

    There's for thy pains.

Clown

    No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.

DUKE ORSINO

    I'll pay thy pleasure then.

Clown

    Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.

DUKE ORSINO

    Give me now leave to leave thee.

Clown

    Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
    tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for
    thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
    constancy put to sea, that their business might be
    every thing and their intent every where; for that's
    it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.

    Exit

DUKE ORSINO

    Let all the rest give place.

    CURIO and Attendants retire
    Once more, Cesario,
    Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
    Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
    Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
    The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
    Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
    But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
    That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.

VIOLA

    But if she cannot love you, sir?

DUKE ORSINO

    I cannot be so answer'd.

VIOLA

    Sooth, but you must.
    Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
    Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
    As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;
    You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?

DUKE ORSINO

    There is no woman's sides
    Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
    As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
    So big, to hold so much; they lack retention
    Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
    No motion of the liver, but the palate,
    That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;
    But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
    And can digest as much: make no compare
    Between that love a woman can bear me
    And that I owe Olivia.

VIOLA

    Ay, but I know--

DUKE ORSINO

    What dost thou know?

VIOLA

    Too well what love women to men may owe:
    In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
    My father had a daughter loved a man,
    As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
    I should your lordship.

DUKE ORSINO

    And what's her history?

VIOLA

    A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
    But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
    Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
    And with a green and yellow melancholy
    She sat like patience on a monument,
    Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
    We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
    Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
    Much in our vows, but little in our love.

DUKE ORSINO

    But died thy sister of her love, my boy?

VIOLA

    I am all the daughters of my father's house,
    And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
    Sir, shall I to this lady?

DUKE ORSINO

    Ay, that's the theme.
    To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,
    My love can give no place, bide no denay.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. OLIVIA's garden.

    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.

FABIAN

    Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,
    let me be boiled to death with melancholy.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
    rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?

FABIAN

    I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'
    favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will
    fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?

SIR ANDREW

    An we do not, it is pity of our lives.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Here comes the little villain.

    Enter MARIA
    How now, my metal of India!

MARIA

    Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
    coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
    sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
    hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I
    know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
    him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,

    Throws down a letter
    for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.

    Exit

    Enter MALVOLIO

MALVOLIO

    'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told
    me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
    thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one
    of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more
    exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
    What should I think on't?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Here's an overweening rogue!

FABIAN

    O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock
    of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!

SIR ANDREW

    'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Peace, I say.

MALVOLIO

    To be Count Malvolio!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Ah, rogue!

SIR ANDREW

    Pistol him, pistol him.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Peace, peace!

MALVOLIO

    There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy
    married the yeoman of the wardrobe.

SIR ANDREW

    Fie on him, Jezebel!

FABIAN

    O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how
    imagination blows him.

MALVOLIO

    Having been three months married to her, sitting in
    my state,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

    O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!

MALVOLIO

    Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet
    gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left
    Olivia sleeping,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Fire and brimstone!

FABIAN

    O, peace, peace!

MALVOLIO

    And then to have the humour of state; and after a
    demure travel of regard, telling them I know my
    place as I would they should do theirs, to for my
    kinsman Toby,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Bolts and shackles!

FABIAN

    O peace, peace, peace! now, now.

MALVOLIO

    Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make
    out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind
    up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby
    approaches; courtesies there to me,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Shall this fellow live?

FABIAN

    Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.

MALVOLIO

    I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar
    smile with an austere regard of control,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

    And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?

MALVOLIO

    Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on
    your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--

SIR TOBY BELCH

    What, what?

MALVOLIO

    'You must amend your drunkenness.'

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Out, scab!

FABIAN

    Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.

MALVOLIO

    'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with
    a foolish knight,'--

SIR ANDREW

    That's me, I warrant you.

MALVOLIO

    'One Sir Andrew,'--

SIR ANDREW

    I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.

MALVOLIO

    What employment have we here?

    Taking up the letter

FABIAN

    Now is the woodcock near the gin.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading
    aloud to him!

MALVOLIO

    By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her
    very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her
    great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.

SIR ANDREW

    Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?

MALVOLIO

    [Reads] 'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good
    wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.
    Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she
    uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?

FABIAN

    This wins him, liver and all.

MALVOLIO

    [Reads]
    Jove knows I love: But who?
    Lips, do not move;
    No man must know.
    'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers
    altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be
    thee, Malvolio?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Marry, hang thee, brock!

MALVOLIO

    [Reads]
    I may command where I adore;
    But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
    With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:
    M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.

FABIAN

    A fustian riddle!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Excellent wench, say I.

MALVOLIO

    'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let
    me see, let me see, let me see.

FABIAN

    What dish o' poison has she dressed him!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!

MALVOLIO

    'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command
    me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is
    evident to any formal capacity; there is no
    obstruction in this: and the end,--what should
    that alphabetical position portend? If I could make
    that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,
    I,--

SIR TOBY BELCH

    O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.

FABIAN

    Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as
    rank as a fox.

MALVOLIO

    M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.

FABIAN

    Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is
    excellent at faults.

MALVOLIO

    M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;
    that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.

FABIAN

    And O shall end, I hope.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!

MALVOLIO

    And then I comes behind.

FABIAN

    Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see
    more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
    you.

MALVOLIO

    M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and
    yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
    every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
    here follows prose.

    Reads
    'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
    am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
    are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
    have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
    their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
    and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
    cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
    opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
    thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
    the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
    that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
    yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
    cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
    made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
    thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
    not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
    She that would alter services with thee,
    THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'
    Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
    open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
    I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
    acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
    I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
    me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
    loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
    late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
    and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
    with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
    of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
    be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
    cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
    on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
    postscript.

    Reads
    'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
    entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;
    thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
    presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
    Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
    everything that thou wilt have me.

    Exit

FABIAN

    I will not give my part of this sport for a pension
    of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    I could marry this wench for this device.

SIR ANDREW

    So could I too.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.

SIR ANDREW

    Nor I neither.

FABIAN

    Here comes my noble gull-catcher.

    Re-enter MARIA

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?

SIR ANDREW

    Or o' mine either?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy
    bond-slave?

SIR ANDREW

    I' faith, or I either?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when
    the image of it leaves him he must run mad.

MARIA

    Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.

MARIA

    If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark
    his first approach before my lady: he will come to
    her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she
    abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;
    and he will smile upon her, which will now be so
    unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
    melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him
    into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow
    me.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!

SIR ANDREW

    I'll make one too.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. OLIVIA's garden.

    Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour

VIOLA

    Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
    thy tabour?

Clown

    No, sir, I live by the church.

VIOLA

    Art thou a churchman?

Clown

    No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for
    I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
    the church.

VIOLA

    So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a
    beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy
    tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.

Clown

    You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
    but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
    wrong side may be turned outward!

VIOLA

    Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with
    words may quickly make them wanton.

Clown

    I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.

VIOLA

    Why, man?

Clown

    Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that
    word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
    are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.

VIOLA

    Thy reason, man?

Clown

    Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and
    words are grown so false, I am loath to prove
    reason with them.

VIOLA

    I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.

Clown

    Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my
    conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be
    to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.

VIOLA

    Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?

Clown

    No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she
    will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and
    fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
    herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not
    her fool, but her corrupter of words.

VIOLA

    I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.

Clown

    Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,
    it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but
    the fool should be as oft with your master as with
    my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.

VIOLA

    Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
    Hold, there's expenses for thee.

Clown

    Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!

VIOLA

    By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for
    one;

    Aside
    though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy
    lady within?

Clown

    Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?

VIOLA

    Yes, being kept together and put to use.

Clown

    I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring
    a Cressida to this Troilus.

VIOLA

    I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.

Clown

    The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but
    a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
    within, sir. I will construe to them whence you
    come; who you are and what you would are out of my
    welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.

    Exit

VIOLA

    This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
    And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
    He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
    The quality of persons, and the time,
    And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather
    That comes before his eye. This is a practise
    As full of labour as a wise man's art
    For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
    But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.

    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Save you, gentleman.

VIOLA

    And you, sir.

SIR ANDREW

    Dieu vous garde, monsieur.

VIOLA

    Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.

SIR ANDREW

    I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous
    you should enter, if your trade be to her.

VIOLA

    I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the
    list of my voyage.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.

VIOLA

    My legs do better understand me, sir, than I
    understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    I mean, to go, sir, to enter.

VIOLA

    I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we
    are prevented.

    Enter OLIVIA and MARIA
    Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain
    odours on you!

SIR ANDREW

    That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.

VIOLA

    My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant
    and vouchsafed ear.

SIR ANDREW

    'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em
    all three all ready.

OLIVIA

    Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.

    Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA
    Give me your hand, sir.

VIOLA

    My duty, madam, and most humble service.

OLIVIA

    What is your name?

VIOLA

    Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.

OLIVIA

    My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
    Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
    You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.

VIOLA

    And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
    Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.

OLIVIA

    For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
    Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!

VIOLA

    Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
    On his behalf.

OLIVIA

    O, by your leave, I pray you,
    I bade you never speak again of him:
    But, would you undertake another suit,
    I had rather hear you to solicit that
    Than music from the spheres.

VIOLA

    Dear lady,--

OLIVIA

    Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
    After the last enchantment you did here,
    A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
    Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:
    Under your hard construction must I sit,
    To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
    Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
    Have you not set mine honour at the stake
    And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
    That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
    Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
    Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.

VIOLA

    I pity you.

OLIVIA

    That's a degree to love.

VIOLA

    No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,
    That very oft we pity enemies.

OLIVIA

    Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.
    O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
    If one should be a prey, how much the better
    To fall before the lion than the wolf!

    Clock strikes
    The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
    Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
    And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
    Your were is alike to reap a proper man:
    There lies your way, due west.

VIOLA

    Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
    Attend your ladyship!
    You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?

OLIVIA

    Stay:
    I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.

VIOLA

    That you do think you are not what you are.

OLIVIA

    If I think so, I think the same of you.

VIOLA

    Then think you right: I am not what I am.

OLIVIA

    I would you were as I would have you be!

VIOLA

    Would it be better, madam, than I am?
    I wish it might, for now I am your fool.

OLIVIA

    O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
    In the contempt and anger of his lip!
    A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
    Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
    Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
    By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,
    I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
    Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
    Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
    For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
    But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
    Love sought is good, but given unsought better.

VIOLA

    By innocence I swear, and by my youth
    I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,
    And that no woman has; nor never none
    Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
    And so adieu, good madam: never more
    Will I my master's tears to you deplore.

OLIVIA

    Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
    That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.

    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN

SIR ANDREW

    No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.

FABIAN

    You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.

SIR ANDREW

    Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the
    count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;
    I saw't i' the orchard.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.

SIR ANDREW

    As plain as I see you now.

FABIAN

    This was a great argument of love in her toward you.

SIR ANDREW

    'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?

FABIAN

    I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of
    judgment and reason.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah
    was a sailor.

FABIAN

    She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
    to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to
    put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
    You should then have accosted her; and with some
    excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should
    have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
    looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the
    double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
    off, and you are now sailed into the north of my
    lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle
    on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by
    some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.

SIR ANDREW

    An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy
    I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a
    politician.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
    valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
    with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall
    take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no
    love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's
    commendation with woman than report of valour.

FABIAN

    There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.

SIR ANDREW

    Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;
    it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun
    of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:
    if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be
    amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
    paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
    bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.
    Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou
    write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.

SIR ANDREW

    Where shall I find you?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.

    Exit SIR ANDREW

FABIAN

    This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand
    strong, or so.

FABIAN

    We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll
    not deliver't?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the
    youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
    cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were
    opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as
    will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of
    the anatomy.

FABIAN

    And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no
    great presage of cruelty.

    Enter MARIA

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.

MARIA

    If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself
    into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is
    turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no
    Christian, that means to be saved by believing
    rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages
    of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    And cross-gartered?

MARIA

    Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school
    i' the church. I have dogged him, like his
    murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
    that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
    face into more lines than is in the new map with the
    augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such
    a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things
    at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,
    he'll smile and take't for a great favour.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Come, bring us, bring us where he is.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A street.

    Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO

SEBASTIAN

    I would not by my will have troubled you;
    But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
    I will no further chide you.

ANTONIO

    I could not stay behind you: my desire,
    More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
    And not all love to see you, though so much
    As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,
    But jealousy what might befall your travel,
    Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
    Unguided and unfriended, often prove
    Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
    The rather by these arguments of fear,
    Set forth in your pursuit.

SEBASTIAN

    My kind Antonio,
    I can no other answer make but thanks,
    And thanks; and ever [ ] oft good turns
    Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:
    But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
    You should find better dealing. What's to do?
    Shall we go see the reliques of this town?

ANTONIO

    To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.

SEBASTIAN

    I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:
    I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
    With the memorials and the things of fame
    That do renown this city.

ANTONIO

    Would you'ld pardon me;
    I do not without danger walk these streets:
    Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys
    I did some service; of such note indeed,
    That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.

SEBASTIAN

    Belike you slew great number of his people.

ANTONIO

    The offence is not of such a bloody nature;
    Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
    Might well have given us bloody argument.
    It might have since been answer'd in repaying
    What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
    Most of our city did: only myself stood out;
    For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
    I shall pay dear.

SEBASTIAN

    Do not then walk too open.

ANTONIO

    It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.
    In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
    Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,
    Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
    With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.

SEBASTIAN

    Why I your purse?

ANTONIO

    Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
    You have desire to purchase; and your store,
    I think, is not for idle markets, sir.

SEBASTIAN

    I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you
    For an hour.

ANTONIO

    To the Elephant.

SEBASTIAN

    I do remember.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. OLIVIA's garden.

    Enter OLIVIA and MARIA

OLIVIA

    I have sent after him: he says he'll come;
    How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
    For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
    I speak too loud.
    Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,
    And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
    Where is Malvolio?

MARIA

    He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He
    is, sure, possessed, madam.

OLIVIA

    Why, what's the matter? does he rave?

MARIA

    No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
    ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if
    he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.

OLIVIA

    Go call him hither.

    Exit MARIA
    I am as mad as he,
    If sad and merry madness equal be.

    Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO
    How now, Malvolio!

MALVOLIO

    Sweet lady, ho, ho.

OLIVIA

    Smilest thou?
    I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.

MALVOLIO

    Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some
    obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but
    what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is
    with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and
    please all.'

OLIVIA

    Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?

MALVOLIO

    Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It
    did come to his hands, and commands shall be
    executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.

OLIVIA

    Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?

MALVOLIO

    To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.

OLIVIA

    God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss
    thy hand so oft?

MARIA

    How do you, Malvolio?

MALVOLIO

    At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.

MARIA

    Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?

MALVOLIO

    'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.

OLIVIA

    What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?

MALVOLIO

    'Some are born great,'--

OLIVIA

    Ha!

MALVOLIO

    'Some achieve greatness,'--

OLIVIA

    What sayest thou?

MALVOLIO

    'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'

OLIVIA

    Heaven restore thee!

MALVOLIO

    'Remember who commended thy yellow stocking s,'--

OLIVIA

    Thy yellow stockings!

MALVOLIO

    'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'

OLIVIA

    Cross-gartered!

MALVOLIO

    'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--

OLIVIA

    Am I made?

MALVOLIO

    'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'

OLIVIA

    Why, this is very midsummer madness.

    Enter Servant

Servant

    Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is
    returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he
    attends your ladyship's pleasure.

OLIVIA

    I'll come to him.

    Exit Servant
    Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's
    my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special
    care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the
    half of my dowry.

    Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA

MALVOLIO

    O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than
    Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
    the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may
    appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that
    in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;
    'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
    let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
    thyself into the trick of singularity;' and
    consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
    face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
    habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
    limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
    thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
    fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
    after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
    adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
    scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
    or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
    that can be can come between me and the full
    prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the
    doer of this, and he is to be thanked.

    Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all
    the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion
    himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.

FABIAN

    Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?
    how is't with you, man?

MALVOLIO

    Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go
    off.

MARIA

    Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not
    I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a
    care of him.

MALVOLIO

    Ah, ha! does she so?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently
    with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how
    is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:
    consider, he's an enemy to mankind.

MALVOLIO

    Do you know what you say?

MARIA

    La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes
    it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!

FABIAN

    Carry his water to the wise woman.

MARIA

    Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I
    live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.

MALVOLIO

    How now, mistress!

MARIA

    O Lord!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do
    you not see you move him? let me alone with him.

FABIAN

    No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is
    rough, and will not be roughly used.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?

MALVOLIO

    Sir!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for
    gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang
    him, foul collier!

MARIA

    Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.

MALVOLIO

    My prayers, minx!

MARIA

    No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.

MALVOLIO

    Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow
    things: I am not of your element: you shall know
    more hereafter.

    Exit

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Is't possible?

FABIAN

    If this were played upon a stage now, I could
    condemn it as an improbable fiction.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.

MARIA

    Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.

FABIAN

    Why, we shall make him mad indeed.

MARIA

    The house will be the quieter.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My
    niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we
    may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,
    till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt
    us to have mercy on him: at which time we will
    bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
    finder of madmen. But see, but see.

    Enter SIR ANDREW

FABIAN

    More matter for a May morning.

SIR ANDREW

    Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's
    vinegar and pepper in't.

FABIAN

    Is't so saucy?

SIR ANDREW

    Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Give me.

    Reads
    'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'

FABIAN

    Good, and valiant.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    [Reads] 'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,
    why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'

FABIAN

    A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    [Reads] 'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my
    sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy
    throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'

FABIAN

    Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    [Reads] 'I will waylay thee going home; where if it
    be thy chance to kill me,'--

FABIAN

    Good.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    [Reads] 'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'

FABIAN

    Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    [Reads] 'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon
    one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but
    my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy
    friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,
    ANDREW AGUECHEEK.
    If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:
    I'll give't him.

MARIA

    You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in
    some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the
    orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest
    him, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; for
    it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a
    swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood
    more approbation than ever proof itself would have
    earned him. Away!

SIR ANDREW

    Nay, let me alone for swearing.

    Exit

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior
    of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
    capacity and breeding; his employment between his
    lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this
    letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no
    terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
    clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by
    word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report
    of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his
    youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous
    opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.
    This will so fright them both that they will kill
    one another by the look, like cockatrices.

    Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLA

FABIAN

    Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
    he take leave, and presently after him.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
    for a challenge.

    Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIA

OLIVIA

    I have said too much unto a heart of stone
    And laid mine honour too unchary out:
    There's something in me that reproves my fault;
    But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
    That it but mocks reproof.

VIOLA

    With the same 'havior that your passion bears
    Goes on my master's grief.

OLIVIA

    Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;
    Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
    And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
    What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
    That honour saved may upon asking give?

VIOLA

    Nothing but this; your true love for my master.

OLIVIA

    How with mine honour may I give him that
    Which I have given to you?

VIOLA

    I will acquit you.

OLIVIA

    Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:
    A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.

    Exit

    Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Gentleman, God save thee.

VIOLA

    And you, sir.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what
    nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
    not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
    the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:
    dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for
    thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.

VIOLA

    You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel
    to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
    any image of offence done to any man.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,
    if you hold your life at any price, betake you to
    your guard; for your opposite hath in him what
    youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.

VIOLA

    I pray you, sir, what is he?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
    carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private
    brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and
    his incensement at this moment is so implacable,
    that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
    and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.

VIOLA

    I will return again into the house and desire some
    conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
    of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
    others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man
    of that quirk.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a
    very competent injury: therefore, get you on and
    give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
    house, unless you undertake that with me which with
    as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
    or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you
    must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.

VIOLA

    This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me
    this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
    my offence to him is: it is something of my
    negligence, nothing of my purpose.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this
    gentleman till my return.

    Exit

VIOLA

    Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?

FABIAN

    I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a
    mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.

VIOLA

    I beseech you, what manner of man is he?

FABIAN

    Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by
    his form, as you are like to find him in the proof
    of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,
    bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
    have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
    towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
    can.

VIOLA

    I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
    had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
    care not who knows so much of my mettle.

    Exeunt

    Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a
    firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
    all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
    motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he
    pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
    step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.

SIR ANDREW

    Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can
    scarce hold him yonder.

SIR ANDREW

    Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so
    cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld
    have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
    and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show
    on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.

    Aside
    Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.

    Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA

    To FABIAN
    I have his horse to take up the quarrel:
    I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.

FABIAN

    He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and
    looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    [To VIOLA] There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
    with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better
    bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
    scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for
    the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.

VIOLA

    [Aside] Pray God defend me! A little thing would
    make me tell them how much I lack of a man.

FABIAN

    Give ground, if you see him furious.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman
    will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;
    he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
    promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
    will not hurt you. Come on; to't.

SIR ANDREW

    Pray God, he keep his oath!

VIOLA

    I do assure you, 'tis against my will.

    They draw

    Enter ANTONIO

ANTONIO

    Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
    Have done offence, I take the fault on me:
    If you offend him, I for him defy you.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    You, sir! why, what are you?

ANTONIO

    One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
    Than you have heard him brag to you he will.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.

    They draw

    Enter Officers

FABIAN

    O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    I'll be with you anon.

VIOLA

    Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.

SIR ANDREW

    Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,
    I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily
    and reins well.

First Officer

    This is the man; do thy office.

Second Officer

    Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.

ANTONIO

    You do mistake me, sir.

First Officer

    No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
    Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
    Take him away: he knows I know him well.

ANTONIO

    I must obey.

    To VIOLA
    This comes with seeking you:
    But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.
    What will you do, now my necessity
    Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
    Much more for what I cannot do for you
    Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
    But be of comfort.

Second Officer

    Come, sir, away.

ANTONIO

    I must entreat of you some of that money.

VIOLA

    What money, sir?
    For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
    And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,
    Out of my lean and low ability
    I'll lend you something: my having is not much;
    I'll make division of my present with you:
    Hold, there's half my coffer.

ANTONIO

    Will you deny me now?
    Is't possible that my deserts to you
    Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
    Lest that it make me so unsound a man
    As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
    That I have done for you.

VIOLA

    I know of none;
    Nor know I you by voice or any feature:
    I hate ingratitude more in a man
    Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
    Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
    Inhabits our frail blood.

ANTONIO

    O heavens themselves!

Second Officer

    Come, sir, I pray you, go.

ANTONIO

    Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
    I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
    Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
    And to his image, which methought did promise
    Most venerable worth, did I devotion.

First Officer

    What's that to us? The time goes by: away!

ANTONIO

    But O how vile an idol proves this god
    Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
    In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
    None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
    Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
    Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.

First Officer

    The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.

ANTONIO

    Lead me on.

    Exit with Officers

VIOLA

    Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
    That he believes himself: so do not I.
    Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
    That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll
    whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.

VIOLA

    He named Sebastian: I my brother know
    Yet living in my glass; even such and so
    In favour was my brother, and he went
    Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
    For him I imitate: O, if it prove,
    Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.

    Exit

SIR TOBY BELCH

    A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than
    a hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his
    friend here in necessity and denying him; and for
    his cowardship, ask Fabian.

FABIAN

    A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.

SIR ANDREW

    'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.

SIR ANDREW

    An I do not,--

FABIAN

    Come, let's see the event.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.

    Enter SEBASTIAN and Clown

Clown

    Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?

SEBASTIAN

    Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:
    Let me be clear of thee.

Clown

    Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor
    I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come
    speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario;
    nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.

SEBASTIAN

    I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou
    know'st not me.

Clown

    Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some
    great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my
    folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,
    will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy
    strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my
    lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?

SEBASTIAN

    I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's
    money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give
    worse payment.

Clown

    By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men
    that give fools money get themselves a good
    report--after fourteen years' purchase.

    Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY BELCH, and FABIAN

SIR ANDREW

    Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.

SEBASTIAN

    Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all
    the people mad?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.

Clown

    This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be
    in some of your coats for two pence.

    Exit

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Come on, sir; hold.

SIR ANDREW

    Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work
    with him; I'll have an action of battery against
    him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I
    struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.

SEBASTIAN

    Let go thy hand.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young
    soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.

SEBASTIAN

    I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If
    thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two
    of this malapert blood from you.

    Enter OLIVIA

OLIVIA

    Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Madam!

OLIVIA

    Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,
    Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
    Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!
    Be not offended, dear Cesario.
    Rudesby, be gone!

    Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN
    I prithee, gentle friend,
    Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
    In this uncivil and thou unjust extent
    Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
    And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
    This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby
    Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:
    Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
    He started one poor heart of mine in thee.

SEBASTIAN

    What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
    Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
    Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
    If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!

OLIVIA

    Nay, come, I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!

SEBASTIAN

    Madam, I will.

OLIVIA

    O, say so, and so be!

    Exeunt

SCENE II. OLIVIA's house.

    Enter MARIA and Clown

MARIA

    Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;
    make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do
    it quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.

    Exit

Clown

    Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself
    in't; and I would I were the first that ever
    dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to
    become the function well, nor lean enough to be
    thought a good student; but to be said an honest man
    and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a
    careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.

    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Jove bless thee, master Parson.

Clown

    Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of
    Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily
    said to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That that is is;'
    so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for,
    what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    To him, Sir Topas.

Clown

    What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.

MALVOLIO

    [Within] Who calls there?

Clown

    Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio
    the lunatic.

MALVOLIO

    Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.

Clown

    Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!
    talkest thou nothing but of ladies?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Well said, Master Parson.

MALVOLIO

    Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir
    Topas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me
    here in hideous darkness.

Clown

    Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most
    modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones
    that will use the devil himself with courtesy:
    sayest thou that house is dark?

MALVOLIO

    As hell, Sir Topas.

Clown

    Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,
    and the clearstores toward the south north are as
    lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of
    obstruction?

MALVOLIO

    I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.

Clown

    Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness
    but ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled than
    the Egyptians in their fog.

MALVOLIO

    I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though
    ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, there
    was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you
    are: make the trial of it in any constant question.

Clown

    What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?

MALVOLIO

    That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.

Clown

    What thinkest thou of his opinion?

MALVOLIO

    I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.

Clown

    Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness:
    thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will
    allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest
    thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.

MALVOLIO

    Sir Topas, Sir Topas!

SIR TOBY BELCH

    My most exquisite Sir Topas!

Clown

    Nay, I am for all waters.

MARIA

    Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and
    gown: he sees thee not.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how
    thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this
    knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I
    would he were, for I am now so far in offence with
    my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this
    sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.

    Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA

Clown

    [Singing]
    'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,
    Tell me how thy lady does.'

MALVOLIO

    Fool!

Clown

    'My lady is unkind, perdy.'

MALVOLIO

    Fool!

Clown

    'Alas, why is she so?'

MALVOLIO

    Fool, I say!

Clown

    'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?

MALVOLIO

    Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my
    hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:
    as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to
    thee for't.

Clown

    Master Malvolio?

MALVOLIO

    Ay, good fool.

Clown

    Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?

MALVOLIO

    Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I
    am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.

Clown

    But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no
    better in your wits than a fool.

MALVOLIO

    They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,
    send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to
    face me out of my wits.

Clown

    Advise you what you say; the minister is here.
    Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!
    endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain
    bibble babble.

MALVOLIO

    Sir Topas!

Clown

    Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I,
    sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas.
    Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.

MALVOLIO

    Fool, fool, fool, I say!

Clown

    Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am
    shent for speaking to you.

MALVOLIO

    Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I
    tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.

Clown

    Well-a-day that you were, sir

MALVOLIO

    By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and
    light; and convey what I will set down to my lady:
    it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing
    of letter did.

Clown

    I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you
    not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?

MALVOLIO

    Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.

Clown

    Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his
    brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.

MALVOLIO

    Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I
    prithee, be gone.

Clown

    [Singing]
    I am gone, sir,
    And anon, sir,
    I'll be with you again,
    In a trice,
    Like to the old Vice,
    Your need to sustain;
    Who, with dagger of lath,
    In his rage and his wrath,
    Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:
    Like a mad lad,
    Pare thy nails, dad;
    Adieu, good man devil.

    Exit

SCENE III. OLIVIA's garden.

    Enter SEBASTIAN

SEBASTIAN

    This is the air; that is the glorious sun;
    This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;
    And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
    Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?
    I could not find him at the Elephant:
    Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,
    That he did range the town to seek me out.
    His counsel now might do me golden service;
    For though my soul disputes well with my sense,
    That this may be some error, but no madness,
    Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
    So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
    That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
    And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
    To any other trust but that I am mad
    Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,
    She could not sway her house, command her followers,
    Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
    With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing
    As I perceive she does: there's something in't
    That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.

    Enter OLIVIA and Priest

OLIVIA

    Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,
    Now go with me and with this holy man
    Into the chantry by: there, before him,
    And underneath that consecrated roof,
    Plight me the full assurance of your faith;
    That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
    May live at peace. He shall conceal it
    Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
    What time we will our celebration keep
    According to my birth. What do you say?

SEBASTIAN

    I'll follow this good man, and go with you;
    And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.

OLIVIA

    Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,
    That they may fairly note this act of mine!

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Before OLIVIA's house.

    Enter Clown and FABIAN

FABIAN

    Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.

Clown

    Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.

FABIAN

    Any thing.

Clown

    Do not desire to see this letter.

FABIAN

    This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my
    dog again.

    Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords

DUKE ORSINO

    Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?

Clown

    Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.

DUKE ORSINO

    I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?

Clown

    Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse
    for my friends.

DUKE ORSINO

    Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.

Clown

    No, sir, the worse.

DUKE ORSINO

    How can that be?

Clown

    Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;
    now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
    my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,
    and by my friends, I am abused: so that,
    conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives
    make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for
    my friends and the better for my foes.

DUKE ORSINO

    Why, this is excellent.

Clown

    By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be
    one of my friends.

DUKE ORSINO

    Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.

Clown

    But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would
    you could make it another.

DUKE ORSINO

    O, you give me ill counsel.

Clown

    Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,
    and let your flesh and blood obey it.

DUKE ORSINO

    Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a
    double-dealer: there's another.

Clown

    Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old
    saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,
    sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of
    Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.

DUKE ORSINO

    You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
    if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
    with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake
    my bounty further.

Clown

    Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come
    again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think
    that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
    but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I
    will awake it anon.

    Exit

VIOLA

    Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.

    Enter ANTONIO and Officers

DUKE ORSINO

    That face of his I do remember well;
    Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd
    As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
    A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
    For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
    With which such scathful grapple did he make
    With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
    That very envy and the tongue of loss
    Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?

First Officer

    Orsino, this is that Antonio
    That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;
    And this is he that did the Tiger board,
    When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
    Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
    In private brabble did we apprehend him.

VIOLA

    He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;
    But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
    I know not what 'twas but distraction.

DUKE ORSINO

    Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
    What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
    Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
    Hast made thine enemies?

ANTONIO

    Orsino, noble sir,
    Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
    Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
    Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
    Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
    That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
    From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
    Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
    His life I gave him and did thereto add
    My love, without retention or restraint,
    All his in dedication; for his sake
    Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
    Into the danger of this adverse town;
    Drew to defend him when he was beset:
    Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
    Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
    Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
    And grew a twenty years removed thing
    While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
    Which I had recommended to his use
    Not half an hour before.

VIOLA

    How can this be?

DUKE ORSINO

    When came he to this town?

ANTONIO

    To-day, my lord; and for three months before,
    No interim, not a minute's vacancy,
    Both day and night did we keep company.

    Enter OLIVIA and Attendants

DUKE ORSINO

    Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
    But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:
    Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
    But more of that anon. Take him aside.

OLIVIA

    What would my lord, but that he may not have,
    Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
    Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.

VIOLA

    Madam!

DUKE ORSINO

    Gracious Olivia,--

OLIVIA

    What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--

VIOLA

    My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.

OLIVIA

    If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
    It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
    As howling after music.

DUKE ORSINO

    Still so cruel?

OLIVIA

    Still so constant, lord.

DUKE ORSINO

    What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
    To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
    My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
    That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?

OLIVIA

    Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.

DUKE ORSINO

    Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
    Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
    Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
    That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
    Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
    And that I partly know the instrument
    That screws me from my true place in your favour,
    Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
    But this your minion, whom I know you love,
    And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
    Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
    Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
    Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:
    I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
    To spite a raven's heart within a dove.

VIOLA

    And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
    To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.

OLIVIA

    Where goes Cesario?

VIOLA

    After him I love
    More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
    More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
    If I do feign, you witnesses above
    Punish my life for tainting of my love!

OLIVIA

    Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!

VIOLA

    Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?

OLIVIA

    Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
    Call forth the holy father.

DUKE ORSINO

    Come, away!

OLIVIA

    Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.

DUKE ORSINO

    Husband!

OLIVIA

    Ay, husband: can he that deny?

DUKE ORSINO

    Her husband, sirrah!

VIOLA

    No, my lord, not I.

OLIVIA

    Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
    That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
    Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
    Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
    As great as that thou fear'st.

    Enter Priest
    O, welcome, father!
    Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
    Here to unfold, though lately we intended
    To keep in darkness what occasion now
    Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
    Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.

Priest

    A contract of eternal bond of love,
    Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,
    Attested by the holy close of lips,
    Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;
    And all the ceremony of this compact
    Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:
    Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
    I have travell'd but two hours.

DUKE ORSINO

    O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
    When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
    Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
    That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
    Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
    Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.

VIOLA

    My lord, I do protest--

OLIVIA

    O, do not swear!
    Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.

    Enter SIR ANDREW

SIR ANDREW

    For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently
    to Sir Toby.

OLIVIA

    What's the matter?

SIR ANDREW

    He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
    a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
    help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.

OLIVIA

    Who has done this, Sir Andrew?

SIR ANDREW

    The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for
    a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.

DUKE ORSINO

    My gentleman, Cesario?

SIR ANDREW

    'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
    nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't
    by Sir Toby.

VIOLA

    Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
    You drew your sword upon me without cause;
    But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.

SIR ANDREW

    If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I
    think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.

    Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown
    Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:
    but if he had not been in drink, he would have
    tickled you othergates than he did.

DUKE ORSINO

    How now, gentleman! how is't with you?

SIR TOBY BELCH

    That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end
    on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?

Clown

    O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes
    were set at eight i' the morning.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I
    hate a drunken rogue.

OLIVIA

    Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?

SIR ANDREW

    I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.

SIR TOBY BELCH

    Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
    knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!

OLIVIA

    Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.

    Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW

    Enter SEBASTIAN

SEBASTIAN

    I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:
    But, had it been the brother of my blood,
    I must have done no less with wit and safety.
    You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
    I do perceive it hath offended you:
    Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
    We made each other but so late ago.

DUKE ORSINO

    One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
    A natural perspective, that is and is not!

SEBASTIAN

    Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
    How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,
    Since I have lost thee!

ANTONIO

    Sebastian are you?

SEBASTIAN

    Fear'st thou that, Antonio?

ANTONIO

    How have you made division of yourself?
    An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
    Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?

OLIVIA

    Most wonderful!

SEBASTIAN

    Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
    Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
    Of here and every where. I had a sister,
    Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
    Of charity, what kin are you to me?
    What countryman? what name? what parentage?

VIOLA

    Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
    Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
    So went he suited to his watery tomb:
    If spirits can assume both form and suit
    You come to fright us.

SEBASTIAN

    A spirit I am indeed;
    But am in that dimension grossly clad
    Which from the womb I did participate.
    Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
    I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
    And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'

VIOLA

    My father had a mole upon his brow.

SEBASTIAN

    And so had mine.

VIOLA

    And died that day when Viola from her birth
    Had number'd thirteen years.

SEBASTIAN

    O, that record is lively in my soul!
    He finished indeed his mortal act
    That day that made my sister thirteen years.

VIOLA

    If nothing lets to make us happy both
    But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
    Do not embrace me till each circumstance
    Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
    That I am Viola: which to confirm,
    I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
    Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
    I was preserved to serve this noble count.
    All the occurrence of my fortune since
    Hath been between this lady and this lord.

SEBASTIAN

    [To OLIVIA] So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
    But nature to her bias drew in that.
    You would have been contracted to a maid;
    Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
    You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.

DUKE ORSINO

    Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
    If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
    I shall have share in this most happy wreck.

    To VIOLA
    Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
    Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.

VIOLA

    And all those sayings will I overswear;
    And those swearings keep as true in soul
    As doth that orbed continent the fire
    That severs day from night.

DUKE ORSINO

    Give me thy hand;
    And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.

VIOLA

    The captain that did bring me first on shore
    Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
    Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
    A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.

OLIVIA

    He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
    And yet, alas, now I remember me,
    They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.

    Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN
    A most extracting frenzy of mine own
    From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
    How does he, sirrah?

Clown

    Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
    well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
    letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
    morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
    so it skills not much when they are delivered.

OLIVIA

    Open't, and read it.

Clown

    Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
    the madman.

    Reads
    'By the Lord, madam,'--

OLIVIA

    How now! art thou mad?

Clown

    No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
    will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.

OLIVIA

    Prithee, read i' thy right wits.

Clown

    So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to
    read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.

OLIVIA

    Read it you, sirrah.

    To FABIAN

FABIAN

    [Reads] 'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
    world shall know it: though you have put me into
    darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
    me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
    your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
    me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
    not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
    Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
    unthought of and speak out of my injury.
    THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'

OLIVIA

    Did he write this?

Clown

    Ay, madam.

DUKE ORSINO

    This savours not much of distraction.

OLIVIA

    See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.

    Exit FABIAN
    My lord so please you, these things further
    thought on,
    To think me as well a sister as a wife,
    One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
    Here at my house and at my proper cost.

DUKE ORSINO

    Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.

    To VIOLA
    Your master quits you; and for your service done him,
    So much against the mettle of your sex,
    So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
    And since you call'd me master for so long,
    Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
    Your master's mistress.

OLIVIA

    A sister! you are she.

    Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO

DUKE ORSINO

    Is this the madman?

OLIVIA

    Ay, my lord, this same.
    How now, Malvolio!

MALVOLIO

    Madam, you have done me wrong,
    Notorious wrong.

OLIVIA

    Have I, Malvolio? no.

MALVOLIO

    Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.
    You must not now deny it is your hand:
    Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
    Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:
    You can say none of this: well, grant it then
    And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
    Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
    Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
    To put on yellow stockings and to frown
    Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
    And, acting this in an obedient hope,
    Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
    Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
    And made the most notorious geck and gull
    That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.

OLIVIA

    Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
    Though, I confess, much like the character
    But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
    And now I do bethink me, it was she
    First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,
    And in such forms which here were presupposed
    Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
    This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
    But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
    Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
    Of thine own cause.

FABIAN

    Good madam, hear me speak,
    And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
    Taint the condition of this present hour,
    Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
    Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
    Set this device against Malvolio here,
    Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
    We had conceived against him: Maria writ
    The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
    In recompense whereof he hath married her.
    How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
    May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
    If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
    That have on both sides pass'd.

OLIVIA

    Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!

Clown

    Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,
    and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
    one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but
    that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'
    But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
    a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'
    and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.

MALVOLIO

    I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.

    Exit

OLIVIA

    He hath been most notoriously abused.

DUKE ORSINO

    Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
    He hath not told us of the captain yet:
    When that is known and golden time convents,
    A solemn combination shall be made
    Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,
    We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;
    For so you shall be, while you are a man;
    But when in other habits you are seen,
    Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.

    Exeunt all, except Clown

Clown

    [Sings]
    When that I was and a little tiny boy,
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
    A foolish thing was but a toy,
    For the rain it raineth every day.
    But when I came to man's estate,
    With hey, ho, & c.
    'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
    For the rain, & c.
    But when I came, alas! to wive,
    With hey, ho, & c.
    By swaggering could I never thrive,
    For the rain, & c.
    But when I came unto my beds,
    With hey, ho, & c.
    With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
    For the rain, & c.
    A great while ago the world begun,
    With hey, ho, & c.
    But that's all one, our play is done,
    And we'll strive to please you every day.

    Exit


Two Gentlemen of Verona

ACT I
SCENE I. Verona. An open place.

    Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS

VALENTINE

    Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
    Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
    Were't not affection chains thy tender days
    To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
    I rather would entreat thy company
    To see the wonders of the world abroad,
    Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
    Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
    But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
    Even as I would when I to love begin.

PROTEUS

    Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
    Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
    Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
    Wish me partaker in thy happiness
    When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
    If ever danger do environ thee,
    Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
    For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.

VALENTINE

    And on a love-book pray for my success?

PROTEUS

    Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.

VALENTINE

    That's on some shallow story of deep love:
    How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.

PROTEUS

    That's a deep story of a deeper love:
    For he was more than over shoes in love.

VALENTINE

    'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
    And yet you never swum the Hellespont.

PROTEUS

    Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.

VALENTINE

    No, I will not, for it boots thee not.

PROTEUS

    What?

VALENTINE

    To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
    Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
    With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
    If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
    If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
    However, but a folly bought with wit,
    Or else a wit by folly vanquished.

PROTEUS

    So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.

VALENTINE

    So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.

PROTEUS

    'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.

VALENTINE

    Love is your master, for he masters you:
    And he that is so yoked by a fool,
    Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.

PROTEUS

    Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
    The eating canker dwells, so eating love
    Inhabits in the finest wits of all.

VALENTINE

    And writers say, as the most forward bud
    Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
    Even so by love the young and tender wit
    Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
    Losing his verdure even in the prime
    And all the fair effects of future hopes.
    But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
    That art a votary to fond desire?
    Once more adieu! my father at the road
    Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.

PROTEUS

    And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.

VALENTINE

    Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
    To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
    Of thy success in love, and what news else
    Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
    And likewise will visit thee with mine.

PROTEUS

    All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!

VALENTINE

    As much to you at home! and so, farewell.

    Exit

PROTEUS

    He after honour hunts, I after love:
    He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
    I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
    Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
    Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
    War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
    Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.

    Enter SPEED

SPEED

    Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?

PROTEUS

    But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.

SPEED

    Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
    And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.

PROTEUS

    Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
    An if the shepherd be a while away.

SPEED

    You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,
    and I a sheep?

PROTEUS

    I do.

SPEED

    Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.

PROTEUS

    A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.

SPEED

    This proves me still a sheep.

PROTEUS

    True; and thy master a shepherd.

SPEED

    Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.

PROTEUS

    It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.

SPEED

    The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
    shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks
    not me: therefore I am no sheep.

PROTEUS

    The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
    shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
    wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
    follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.

SPEED

    Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'

PROTEUS

    But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?

SPEED

    Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,
    a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
    lost mutton, nothing for my labour.

PROTEUS

    Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.

SPEED

    If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.

PROTEUS

    Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.

SPEED

    Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
    carrying your letter.

PROTEUS

    You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.

SPEED

    From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
    'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
    your lover.

PROTEUS

    But what said she?

SPEED

    [First nodding] Ay.

PROTEUS

    Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.

SPEED

    You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask
    me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'

PROTEUS

    And that set together is noddy.

SPEED

    Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
    take it for your pains.

PROTEUS

    No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.

SPEED

    Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.

PROTEUS

    Why sir, how do you bear with me?

SPEED

    Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing
    but the word 'noddy' for my pains.

PROTEUS

    Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.

SPEED

    And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.

PROTEUS

    Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?

SPEED

    Open your purse, that the money and the matter may
    be both at once delivered.

PROTEUS

    Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?

SPEED

    Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.

PROTEUS

    Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?

SPEED

    Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,
    not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
    and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
    fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
    mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as
    hard as steel.

PROTEUS

    What said she? nothing?

SPEED

    No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To
    testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
    me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
    letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.

PROTEUS

    Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
    Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
    Being destined to a drier death on shore.

    Exit SPEED
    I must go send some better messenger:
    I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
    Receiving them from such a worthless post.

    Exit

SCENE II. The same. Garden of JULIA's house.

    Enter JULlA and LUCETTA

JULIA

    But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
    Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?

LUCETTA

    Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.

JULIA

    Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
    That every day with parle encounter me,
    In thy opinion which is worthiest love?

LUCETTA

    Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
    According to my shallow simple skill.

JULIA

    What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?

LUCETTA

    As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
    But, were I you, he never should be mine.

JULIA

    What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?

LUCETTA

    Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.

JULIA

    What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?

LUCETTA

    Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!

JULIA

    How now! what means this passion at his name?

LUCETTA

    Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
    That I, unworthy body as I am,
    Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.

JULIA

    Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?

LUCETTA

    Then thus: of many good I think him best.

JULIA

    Your reason?

LUCETTA

    I have no other, but a woman's reason;
    I think him so because I think him so.

JULIA

    And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?

LUCETTA

    Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.

JULIA

    Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.

LUCETTA

    Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.

JULIA

    His little speaking shows his love but small.

LUCETTA

    Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.

JULIA

    They do not love that do not show their love.

LUCETTA

    O, they love least that let men know their love.

JULIA

    I would I knew his mind.

LUCETTA

    Peruse this paper, madam.

JULIA

    'To Julia.' Say, from whom?

LUCETTA

    That the contents will show.

JULIA

    Say, say, who gave it thee?

LUCETTA

    Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
    He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,
    Did in your name receive it: pardon the
    fault I pray.

JULIA

    Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
    Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
    To whisper and conspire against my youth?
    Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
    And you an officer fit for the place.
    Or else return no more into my sight.

LUCETTA

    To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.

JULIA

    Will ye be gone?

LUCETTA

    That you may ruminate.

    Exit

JULIA

    And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:
    It were a shame to call her back again
    And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
    What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
    And would not force the letter to my view!
    Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
    Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
    Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
    That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
    And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
    How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
    When willingly I would have had her here!
    How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
    When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
    My penance is to call Lucetta back
    And ask remission for my folly past.
    What ho! Lucetta!

    Re-enter LUCETTA

LUCETTA

    What would your ladyship?

JULIA

    Is't near dinner-time?

LUCETTA

    I would it were,
    That you might kill your stomach on your meat
    And not upon your maid.

JULIA

    What is't that you took up so gingerly?

LUCETTA

    Nothing.

JULIA

    Why didst thou stoop, then?

LUCETTA

    To take a paper up that I let fall.

JULIA

    And is that paper nothing?

LUCETTA

    Nothing concerning me.

JULIA

    Then let it lie for those that it concerns.

LUCETTA

    Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
    Unless it have a false interpeter.

JULIA

    Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.

LUCETTA

    That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
    Give me a note: your ladyship can set.

JULIA

    As little by such toys as may be possible.
    Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'

LUCETTA

    It is too heavy for so light a tune.

JULIA

    Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?

LUCETTA

    Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.

JULIA

    And why not you?

LUCETTA

    I cannot reach so high.

JULIA

    Let's see your song. How now, minion!

LUCETTA

    Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
    And yet methinks I do not like this tune.

JULIA

    You do not?

LUCETTA

    No, madam; it is too sharp.

JULIA

    You, minion, are too saucy.

LUCETTA

    Nay, now you are too flat
    And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
    There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.

JULIA

    The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.

LUCETTA

    Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.

JULIA

    This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
    Here is a coil with protestation!

    Tears the letter
    Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
    You would be fingering them, to anger me.

LUCETTA

    She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
    To be so anger'd with another letter.

    Exit

JULIA

    Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
    O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
    Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
    And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
    I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
    Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
    As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
    I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
    Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
    And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
    Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
    Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;
    And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
    But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
    Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
    Till I have found each letter in the letter,
    Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
    Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
    And throw it thence into the raging sea!
    Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
    'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
    To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
    And yet I will not, sith so prettily
    He couples it to his complaining names.
    Thus will I fold them one on another:
    Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.

    Re-enter LUCETTA

LUCETTA

    Madam,
    Dinner is ready, and your father stays.

JULIA

    Well, let us go.

LUCETTA

    What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?

JULIA

    If you respect them, best to take them up.

LUCETTA

    Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:
    Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.

JULIA

    I see you have a month's mind to them.

LUCETTA

    Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
    I see things too, although you judge I wink.

JULIA

    Come, come; will't please you go?

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. ANTONIO's house.

    Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO

ANTONIO

    Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
    Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?

PANTHINO

    'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.

ANTONIO

    Why, what of him?

PANTHINO

    He wonder'd that your lordship
    Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
    While other men, of slender reputation,
    Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
    Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
    Some to discover islands far away;
    Some to the studious universities.
    For any or for all these exercises,
    He said that Proteus your son was meet,
    And did request me to importune you
    To let him spend his time no more at home,
    Which would be great impeachment to his age,
    In having known no travel in his youth.

ANTONIO

    Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
    Whereon this month I have been hammering.
    I have consider'd well his loss of time
    And how he cannot be a perfect man,
    Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
    Experience is by industry achieved
    And perfected by the swift course of time.
    Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?

PANTHINO

    I think your lordship is not ignorant
    How his companion, youthful Valentine,
    Attends the emperor in his royal court.

ANTONIO

    I know it well.

PANTHINO

    'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
    There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
    Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.
    And be in eye of every exercise
    Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.

ANTONIO

    I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:
    And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
    The execution of it shall make known.
    Even with the speediest expedition
    I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.

PANTHINO

    To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,
    With other gentlemen of good esteem,
    Are journeying to salute the emperor
    And to commend their service to his will.

ANTONIO

    Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
    And, in good time! now will we break with him.

    Enter PROTEUS

PROTEUS

    Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
    Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
    Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
    O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,
    To seal our happiness with their consents!
    O heavenly Julia!

ANTONIO

    How now! what letter are you reading there?

PROTEUS

    May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
    Of commendations sent from Valentine,
    Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.

ANTONIO

    Lend me the letter; let me see what news.

PROTEUS

    There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
    How happily he lives, how well beloved
    And daily graced by the emperor;
    Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.

ANTONIO

    And how stand you affected to his wish?

PROTEUS

    As one relying on your lordship's will
    And not depending on his friendly wish.

ANTONIO

    My will is something sorted with his wish.
    Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
    For what I will, I will, and there an end.
    I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
    With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
    What maintenance he from his friends receives,
    Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
    To-morrow be in readiness to go:
    Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.

PROTEUS

    My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:
    Please you, deliberate a day or two.

ANTONIO

    Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:
    No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
    Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
    To hasten on his expedition.

    Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO

PROTEUS

    Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
    And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
    I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
    Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
    And with the vantage of mine own excuse
    Hath he excepted most against my love.
    O, how this spring of love resembleth
    The uncertain glory of an April day,
    Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
    And by and by a cloud takes all away!

    Re-enter PANTHINO

PANTHINO

    Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:
    He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.

PROTEUS

    Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,
    And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.

    Enter VALENTINE and SPEED

SPEED

    Sir, your glove.

VALENTINE

    Not mine; my gloves are on.

SPEED

    Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.

VALENTINE

    Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:
    Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
    Ah, Silvia, Silvia!

SPEED

    Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!

VALENTINE

    How now, sirrah?

SPEED

    She is not within hearing, sir.

VALENTINE

    Why, sir, who bade you call her?

SPEED

    Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.

VALENTINE

    Well, you'll still be too forward.

SPEED

    And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.

VALENTINE

    Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?

SPEED

    She that your worship loves?

VALENTINE

    Why, how know you that I am in love?

SPEED

    Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
    learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
    like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a
    robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had
    the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
    lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had
    buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes
    diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to
    speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
    wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
    walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you
    fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
    looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
    are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
    on you, I can hardly think you my master.

VALENTINE

    Are all these things perceived in me?

SPEED

    They are all perceived without ye.

VALENTINE

    Without me? they cannot.

SPEED

    Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you
    were so simple, none else would: but you are so
    without these follies, that these follies are within
    you and shine through you like the water in an
    urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
    physician to comment on your malady.

VALENTINE

    But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?

SPEED

    She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?

VALENTINE

    Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.

SPEED

    Why, sir, I know her not.

VALENTINE

    Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet
    knowest her not?

SPEED

    Is she not hard-favoured, sir?

VALENTINE

    Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.

SPEED

    Sir, I know that well enough.

VALENTINE

    What dost thou know?

SPEED

    That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.

VALENTINE

    I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.

SPEED

    That's because the one is painted and the other out
    of all count.

VALENTINE

    How painted? and how out of count?

SPEED

    Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
    man counts of her beauty.

VALENTINE

    How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.

SPEED

    You never saw her since she was deformed.

VALENTINE

    How long hath she been deformed?

SPEED

    Ever since you loved her.

VALENTINE

    I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
    see her beautiful.

SPEED

    If you love her, you cannot see her.

VALENTINE

    Why?

SPEED

    Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;
    or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
    have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
    ungartered!

VALENTINE

    What should I see then?

SPEED

    Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
    for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
    hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.

VALENTINE

    Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last
    morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.

SPEED

    True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,
    you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
    bolder to chide you for yours.

VALENTINE

    In conclusion, I stand affected to her.

SPEED

    I would you were set, so your affection would cease.

VALENTINE

    Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
    one she loves.

SPEED

    And have you?

VALENTINE

    I have.

SPEED

    Are they not lamely writ?

VALENTINE

    No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!
    here she comes.

SPEED

    [Aside] O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
    Now will he interpret to her.

    Enter SILVIA

VALENTINE

    Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.

SPEED

    [Aside] O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.

SILVIA

    Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.

SPEED

    [Aside] He should give her interest and she gives it him.

VALENTINE

    As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
    Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
    Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
    But for my duty to your ladyship.

SILVIA

    I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.

VALENTINE

    Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
    For being ignorant to whom it goes
    I writ at random, very doubtfully.

SILVIA

    Perchance you think too much of so much pains?

VALENTINE

    No, madam; so it stead you, I will write
    Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--

SILVIA

    A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
    And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
    And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,
    Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.

SPEED

    [Aside] And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'

VALENTINE

    What means your ladyship? do you not like it?

SILVIA

    Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
    But since unwillingly, take them again.
    Nay, take them.

VALENTINE

    Madam, they are for you.

SILVIA

    Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;
    But I will none of them; they are for you;
    I would have had them writ more movingly.

VALENTINE

    Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.

SILVIA

    And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
    And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.

VALENTINE

    If it please me, madam, what then?

SILVIA

    Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:
    And so, good morrow, servant.

    Exit

SPEED

    O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
    As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!
    My master sues to her, and she hath
    taught her suitor,
    He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
    O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,
    That my master, being scribe, to himself should write
    the letter?

VALENTINE

    How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?

SPEED

    Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.

VALENTINE

    To do what?

SPEED

    To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.

VALENTINE

    To whom?

SPEED

    To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.

VALENTINE

    What figure?

SPEED

    By a letter, I should say.

VALENTINE

    Why, she hath not writ to me?

SPEED

    What need she, when she hath made you write to
    yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?

VALENTINE

    No, believe me.

SPEED

    No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive
    her earnest?

VALENTINE

    She gave me none, except an angry word.

SPEED

    Why, she hath given you a letter.

VALENTINE

    That's the letter I writ to her friend.

SPEED

    And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.

VALENTINE

    I would it were no worse.

SPEED

    I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:
    For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,
    Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
    Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
    Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
    All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.
    Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.

VALENTINE

    I have dined.

SPEED

    Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can
    feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my
    victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like
    your mistress; be moved, be moved.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Verona. JULIA'S house.

    Enter PROTEUS and JULIA

PROTEUS

    Have patience, gentle Julia.

JULIA

    I must, where is no remedy.

PROTEUS

    When possibly I can, I will return.

JULIA

    If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
    Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.

    Giving a ring

PROTEUS

    Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.

JULIA

    And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.

PROTEUS

    Here is my hand for my true constancy;
    And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
    Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
    The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
    Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
    My father stays my coming; answer not;
    The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;
    That tide will stay me longer than I should.
    Julia, farewell!

    Exit JULIA
    What, gone without a word?
    Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
    For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.

    Enter PANTHINO

PANTHINO

    Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.

PROTEUS

    Go; I come, I come.
    Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. A street.

    Enter LAUNCE, leading a dog

LAUNCE

    Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;
    all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I
    have received my proportion, like the prodigious
    son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's
    court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured
    dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
    wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat
    wringing her hands, and all our house in a great
    perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed
    one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and
    has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have
    wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,
    having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my
    parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This
    shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:
    no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that
    cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it
    hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in
    it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance
    on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my
    sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and
    as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I
    am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the
    dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,
    so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:
    now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
    now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now
    come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now
    like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there
    'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now
    come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
    the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
    word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.

    Enter PANTHINO

PANTHINO

    Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped
    and thou art to post after with oars. What's the
    matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You'll
    lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.

LAUNCE

    It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the
    unkindest tied that ever any man tied.

PANTHINO

    What's the unkindest tide?

LAUNCE

    Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.

PANTHINO

    Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in
    losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing
    thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy
    master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy
    service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?

LAUNCE

    For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.

PANTHINO

    Where should I lose my tongue?

LAUNCE

    In thy tale.

PANTHINO

    In thy tail!

LAUNCE

    Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and
    the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river
    were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the
    wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.

PANTHINO

    Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.

LAUNCE

    Sir, call me what thou darest.

PANTHINO

    Wilt thou go?

LAUNCE

    Well, I will go.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Milan. The DUKE's palace.

    Enter SILVIA, VALENTINE, THURIO, and SPEED

SILVIA

    Servant!

VALENTINE

    Mistress?

SPEED

    Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.

VALENTINE

    Ay, boy, it's for love.

SPEED

    Not of you.

VALENTINE

    Of my mistress, then.

SPEED

    'Twere good you knocked him.

    Exit

SILVIA

    Servant, you are sad.

VALENTINE

    Indeed, madam, I seem so.

THURIO

    Seem you that you are not?

VALENTINE

    Haply I do.

THURIO

    So do counterfeits.

VALENTINE

    So do you.

THURIO

    What seem I that I am not?

VALENTINE

    Wise.

THURIO

    What instance of the contrary?

VALENTINE

    Your folly.

THURIO

    And how quote you my folly?

VALENTINE

    I quote it in your jerkin.

THURIO

    My jerkin is a doublet.

VALENTINE

    Well, then, I'll double your folly.

THURIO

    How?

SILVIA

    What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?

VALENTINE

    Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.

THURIO

    That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
    in your air.

VALENTINE

    You have said, sir.

THURIO

    Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.

VALENTINE

    I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.

SILVIA

    A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.

VALENTINE

    'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.

SILVIA

    Who is that, servant?

VALENTINE

    Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir
    Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,
    and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.

THURIO

    Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall
    make your wit bankrupt.

VALENTINE

    I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,
    and, I think, no other treasure to give your
    followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,
    that they live by your bare words.

SILVIA

    No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father.

    Enter DUKE

DUKE

    Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
    Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
    What say you to a letter from your friends
    Of much good news?

VALENTINE

    My lord, I will be thankful.
    To any happy messenger from thence.

DUKE

    Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?

VALENTINE

    Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
    To be of worth and worthy estimation
    And not without desert so well reputed.

DUKE

    Hath he not a son?

VALENTINE

    Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
    The honour and regard of such a father.

DUKE

    You know him well?

VALENTINE

    I know him as myself; for from our infancy
    We have conversed and spent our hours together:
    And though myself have been an idle truant,
    Omitting the sweet benefit of time
    To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
    Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,
    Made use and fair advantage of his days;
    His years but young, but his experience old;
    His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
    And, in a word, for far behind his worth
    Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
    He is complete in feature and in mind
    With all good grace to grace a gentleman.

DUKE

    Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
    He is as worthy for an empress' love
    As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
    Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,
    With commendation from great potentates;
    And here he means to spend his time awhile:
    I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.

VALENTINE

    Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.

DUKE

    Welcome him then according to his worth.
    Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
    For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:
    I will send him hither to you presently.

    Exit

VALENTINE

    This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
    Had come along with me, but that his mistress
    Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.

SILVIA

    Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
    Upon some other pawn for fealty.

VALENTINE

    Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.

SILVIA

    Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind
    How could he see his way to seek out you?

VALENTINE

    Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.

THURIO

    They say that Love hath not an eye at all.

VALENTINE

    To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:
    Upon a homely object Love can wink.

SILVIA

    Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.

    Exit THURIO

    Enter PROTEUS

VALENTINE

    Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,
    Confirm his welcome with some special favour.

SILVIA

    His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
    If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.

VALENTINE

    Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him
    To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.

SILVIA

    Too low a mistress for so high a servant.

PROTEUS

    Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant
    To have a look of such a worthy mistress.

VALENTINE

    Leave off discourse of disability:
    Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.

PROTEUS

    My duty will I boast of; nothing else.

SILVIA

    And duty never yet did want his meed:
    Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.

PROTEUS

    I'll die on him that says so but yourself.

SILVIA

    That you are welcome?

PROTEUS

    That you are worthless.

    Re-enter THURIO

THURIO

    Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.

SILVIA

    I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
    Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:
    I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;
    When you have done, we look to hear from you.

PROTEUS

    We'll both attend upon your ladyship.

    Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO

VALENTINE

    Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?

PROTEUS

    Your friends are well and have them much commended.

VALENTINE

    And how do yours?

PROTEUS

    I left them all in health.

VALENTINE

    How does your lady? and how thrives your love?

PROTEUS

    My tales of love were wont to weary you;
    I know you joy not in a love discourse.

VALENTINE

    Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:
    I have done penance for contemning Love,
    Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
    With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
    With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
    For in revenge of my contempt of love,
    Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
    And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
    O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
    And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
    There is no woe to his correction,
    Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
    Now no discourse, except it be of love;
    Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
    Upon the very naked name of love.

PROTEUS

    Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
    Was this the idol that you worship so?

VALENTINE

    Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?

PROTEUS

    No; but she is an earthly paragon.

VALENTINE

    Call her divine.

PROTEUS

    I will not flatter her.

VALENTINE

    O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.

PROTEUS

    When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
    And I must minister the like to you.

VALENTINE

    Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
    Yet let her be a principality,
    Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.

PROTEUS

    Except my mistress.

VALENTINE

    Sweet, except not any;
    Except thou wilt except against my love.

PROTEUS

    Have I not reason to prefer mine own?

VALENTINE

    And I will help thee to prefer her too:
    She shall be dignified with this high honour--
    To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
    Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
    And, of so great a favour growing proud,
    Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
    And make rough winter everlastingly.

PROTEUS

    Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?

VALENTINE

    Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing
    To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;
    She is alone.

PROTEUS

    Then let her alone.

VALENTINE

    Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
    And I as rich in having such a jewel
    As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
    The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
    Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
    Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
    My foolish rival, that her father likes
    Only for his possessions are so huge,
    Is gone with her along, and I must after,
    For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.

PROTEUS

    But she loves you?

VALENTINE

    Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
    marriage-hour,
    With all the cunning manner of our flight,
    Determined of; how I must climb her window,
    The ladder made of cords, and all the means
    Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
    Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
    In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.

PROTEUS

    Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
    I must unto the road, to disembark
    Some necessaries that I needs must use,
    And then I'll presently attend you.

VALENTINE

    Will you make haste?

PROTEUS

    I will.

    Exit VALENTINE
    Even as one heat another heat expels,
    Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
    So the remembrance of my former love
    Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
    Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,
    Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
    That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
    She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
    That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
    Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,
    Bears no impression of the thing it was.
    Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
    And that I love him not as I was wont.
    O, but I love his lady too too much,
    And that's the reason I love him so little.
    How shall I dote on her with more advice,
    That thus without advice begin to love her!
    'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
    And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
    But when I look on her perfections,
    There is no reason but I shall be blind.
    If I can cheque my erring love, I will;
    If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.

    Exit

SCENE V. The same. A street.

    Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally

SPEED

    Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!

LAUNCE

    Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not
    welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never
    undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a
    place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
    say 'Welcome!'

SPEED

    Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you
    presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou
    shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how
    did thy master part with Madam Julia?

LAUNCE

    Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very
    fairly in jest.

SPEED

    But shall she marry him?

LAUNCE

    No.

SPEED

    How then? shall he marry her?

LAUNCE

    No, neither.

SPEED

    What, are they broken?

LAUNCE

    No, they are both as whole as a fish.

SPEED

    Why, then, how stands the matter with them?

LAUNCE

    Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it
    stands well with her.

SPEED

    What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.

LAUNCE

    What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My
    staff understands me.

SPEED

    What thou sayest?

LAUNCE

    Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,
    and my staff understands me.

SPEED

    It stands under thee, indeed.

LAUNCE

    Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.

SPEED

    But tell me true, will't be a match?

LAUNCE

    Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,
    it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.

SPEED

    The conclusion is then that it will.

LAUNCE

    Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.

SPEED

    'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest
    thou, that my master is become a notable lover?

LAUNCE

    I never knew him otherwise.

SPEED

    Than how?

LAUNCE

    A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.

SPEED

    Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.

LAUNCE

    Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.

SPEED

    I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.

LAUNCE

    Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself
    in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;
    if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the
    name of a Christian.

SPEED

    Why?

LAUNCE

    Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
    go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?

SPEED

    At thy service.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. The same. The DUKE'S palace.

    Enter PROTEUS

PROTEUS

    To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
    To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
    To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
    And even that power which gave me first my oath
    Provokes me to this threefold perjury;
    Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
    O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
    Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
    At first I did adore a twinkling star,
    But now I worship a celestial sun.
    Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
    And he wants wit that wants resolved will
    To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
    Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
    Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
    With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
    I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
    But there I leave to love where I should love.
    Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
    If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
    If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
    For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.
    I to myself am dearer than a friend,
    For love is still most precious in itself;
    And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--
    Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
    I will forget that Julia is alive,
    Remembering that my love to her is dead;
    And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
    Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
    I cannot now prove constant to myself,
    Without some treachery used to Valentine.
    This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
    To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
    Myself in counsel, his competitor.
    Now presently I'll give her father notice
    Of their disguising and pretended flight;
    Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;
    For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
    But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross
    By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
    Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
    As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!

    Exit

SCENE VII. Verona. JULIA'S house.

    Enter JULIA and LUCETTA

JULIA

    Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
    And even in kind love I do conjure thee,
    Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
    Are visibly character'd and engraved,
    To lesson me and tell me some good mean
    How, with my honour, I may undertake
    A journey to my loving Proteus.

LUCETTA

    Alas, the way is wearisome and long!

JULIA

    A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
    To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
    Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
    And when the flight is made to one so dear,
    Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.

LUCETTA

    Better forbear till Proteus make return.

JULIA

    O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
    Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
    By longing for that food so long a time.
    Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
    Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
    As seek to quench the fire of love with words.

LUCETTA

    I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
    But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
    Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.

JULIA

    The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
    The current that with gentle murmur glides,
    Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
    But when his fair course is not hindered,
    He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,
    Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
    He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,
    And so by many winding nooks he strays
    With willing sport to the wild ocean.
    Then let me go and hinder not my course
    I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
    And make a pastime of each weary step,
    Till the last step have brought me to my love;
    And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
    A blessed soul doth in Elysium.

LUCETTA

    But in what habit will you go along?

JULIA

    Not like a woman; for I would prevent
    The loose encounters of lascivious men:
    Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
    As may beseem some well-reputed page.

LUCETTA

    Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.

JULIA

    No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
    With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
    To be fantastic may become a youth
    Of greater time than I shall show to be.

LUCETTA

    What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?

JULIA

    That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
    What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
    Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.

LUCETTA

    You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.

JULIA

    Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.

LUCETTA

    A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
    Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.

JULIA

    Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
    What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
    But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
    For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
    I fear me, it will make me scandalized.

LUCETTA

    If you think so, then stay at home and go not.

JULIA

    Nay, that I will not.

LUCETTA

    Then never dream on infamy, but go.
    If Proteus like your journey when you come,
    No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
    I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.

JULIA

    That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
    A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears
    And instances of infinite of love
    Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.

LUCETTA

    All these are servants to deceitful men.

JULIA

    Base men, that use them to so base effect!
    But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
    His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
    His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
    His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
    His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.

LUCETTA

    Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!

JULIA

    Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong
    To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
    Only deserve my love by loving him;
    And presently go with me to my chamber,
    To take a note of what I stand in need of,
    To furnish me upon my longing journey.
    All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
    My goods, my lands, my reputation;
    Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
    Come, answer not, but to it presently!
    I am impatient of my tarriance.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Milan. The DUKE's palace.

    Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS

DUKE

    Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
    We have some secrets to confer about.

    Exit THURIO
    Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?

PROTEUS

    My gracious lord, that which I would discover
    The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
    But when I call to mind your gracious favours
    Done to me, undeserving as I am,
    My duty pricks me on to utter that
    Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
    Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
    This night intends to steal away your daughter:
    Myself am one made privy to the plot.
    I know you have determined to bestow her
    On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
    And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
    It would be much vexation to your age.
    Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
    To cross my friend in his intended drift
    Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
    A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
    Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.

DUKE

    Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
    Which to requite, command me while I live.
    This love of theirs myself have often seen,
    Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
    And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
    Sir Valentine her company and my court:
    But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
    And so unworthily disgrace the man,
    A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
    I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
    That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
    And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
    Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
    I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
    The key whereof myself have ever kept;
    And thence she cannot be convey'd away.

PROTEUS

    Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
    How he her chamber-window will ascend
    And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
    For which the youthful lover now is gone
    And this way comes he with it presently;
    Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
    But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly
    That my discovery be not aimed at;
    For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
    Hath made me publisher of this pretence.

DUKE

    Upon mine honour, he shall never know
    That I had any light from thee of this.

PROTEUS

    Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.

    Exit

    Enter VALENTINE

DUKE

    Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?

VALENTINE

    Please it your grace, there is a messenger
    That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
    And I am going to deliver them.

DUKE

    Be they of much import?

VALENTINE

    The tenor of them doth but signify
    My health and happy being at your court.

DUKE

    Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
    I am to break with thee of some affairs
    That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
    'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
    To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.

VALENTINE

    I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match
    Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman
    Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities
    Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
    Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?

DUKE

    No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
    Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
    Neither regarding that she is my child
    Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
    And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
    Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
    And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
    Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
    I now am full resolved to take a wife
    And turn her out to who will take her in:
    Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
    For me and my possessions she esteems not.

VALENTINE

    What would your Grace have me to do in this?

DUKE

    There is a lady in Verona here
    Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
    And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
    Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
    For long agone I have forgot to court;
    Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
    How and which way I may bestow myself
    To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.

VALENTINE

    Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
    Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
    More than quick words do move a woman's mind.

DUKE

    But she did scorn a present that I sent her.

VALENTINE

    A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
    Send her another; never give her o'er;
    For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
    If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
    But rather to beget more love in you:
    If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
    For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
    Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
    For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
    Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
    Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
    That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
    If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.

DUKE

    But she I mean is promised by her friends
    Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
    And kept severely from resort of men,
    That no man hath access by day to her.

VALENTINE

    Why, then, I would resort to her by night.

DUKE

    Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
    That no man hath recourse to her by night.

VALENTINE

    What lets but one may enter at her window?

DUKE

    Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
    And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
    Without apparent hazard of his life.

VALENTINE

    Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
    To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
    Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
    So bold Leander would adventure it.

DUKE

    Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
    Advise me where I may have such a ladder.

VALENTINE

    When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.

DUKE

    This very night; for Love is like a child,
    That longs for every thing that he can come by.

VALENTINE

    By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.

DUKE

    But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:
    How shall I best convey the ladder thither?

VALENTINE

    It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
    Under a cloak that is of any length.

DUKE

    A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?

VALENTINE

    Ay, my good lord.

DUKE

    Then let me see thy cloak:
    I'll get me one of such another length.

VALENTINE

    Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.

DUKE

    How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
    I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
    What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
    And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
    I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.

    Reads
    'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,
    And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
    O, could their master come and go as lightly,
    Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
    My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
    While I, their king, that hither them importune,
    Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
    Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
    I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
    That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
    What's here?
    'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
    'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
    Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--
    Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
    And with thy daring folly burn the world?
    Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
    Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
    Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
    And think my patience, more than thy desert,
    Is privilege for thy departure hence:
    Thank me for this more than for all the favours
    Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
    But if thou linger in my territories
    Longer than swiftest expedition
    Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
    By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
    I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
    Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
    But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.

    Exit

VALENTINE

    And why not death rather than living torment?
    To die is to be banish'd from myself;
    And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
    Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
    What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
    What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
    Unless it be to think that she is by
    And feed upon the shadow of perfection
    Except I be by Silvia in the night,
    There is no music in the nightingale;
    Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
    There is no day for me to look upon;
    She is my essence, and I leave to be,
    If I be not by her fair influence
    Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
    I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
    Tarry I here, I but attend on death:
    But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.

    Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE

PROTEUS

    Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.

LAUNCE

    Soho, soho!

PROTEUS

    What seest thou?

LAUNCE

    Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head
    but 'tis a Valentine.

PROTEUS

    Valentine?

VALENTINE

    No.

PROTEUS

    Who then? his spirit?

VALENTINE

    Neither.

PROTEUS

    What then?

VALENTINE

    Nothing.

LAUNCE

    Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?

PROTEUS

    Who wouldst thou strike?

LAUNCE

    Nothing.

PROTEUS

    Villain, forbear.

LAUNCE

    Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--

PROTEUS

    Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.

VALENTINE

    My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,
    So much of bad already hath possess'd them.

PROTEUS

    Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
    For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.

VALENTINE

    Is Silvia dead?

PROTEUS

    No, Valentine.

VALENTINE

    No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
    Hath she forsworn me?

PROTEUS

    No, Valentine.

VALENTINE

    No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
    What is your news?

LAUNCE

    Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.

PROTEUS

    That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--
    From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.

VALENTINE

    O, I have fed upon this woe already,
    And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
    Doth Silvia know that I am banished?

PROTEUS

    Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--
    Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--
    A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:
    Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;
    With them, upon her knees, her humble self;
    Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
    As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
    But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
    Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
    Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
    But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.
    Besides, her intercession chafed him so,
    When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
    That to close prison he commanded her,
    With many bitter threats of biding there.

VALENTINE

    No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
    Have some malignant power upon my life:
    If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,
    As ending anthem of my endless dolour.

PROTEUS

    Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
    And study help for that which thou lament'st.
    Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
    Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
    Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
    Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that
    And manage it against despairing thoughts.
    Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;
    Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd
    Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
    The time now serves not to expostulate:
    Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;
    And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
    Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
    As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,
    Regard thy danger, and along with me!

VALENTINE

    I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,
    Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.

PROTEUS

    Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.

VALENTINE

    O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!

    Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS

LAUNCE

    I am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit to
    think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's
    all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now
    that knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but a
    team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who
    'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, I
    will not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet
    'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet 'tis
    a maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves for
    wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;
    which is much in a bare Christian.

    Pulling out a paper
    Here is the cate-log of her condition.
    'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse
    can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only
    carry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:
    She can milk;' look you, a sweet virtue in a maid
    with clean hands.

    Enter SPEED

SPEED

    How now, Signior Launce! what news with your
    mastership?

LAUNCE

    With my master's ship? why, it is at sea.

SPEED

    Well, your old vice still; mistake the word. What
    news, then, in your paper?

LAUNCE

    The blackest news that ever thou heardest.

SPEED

    Why, man, how black?

LAUNCE

    Why, as black as ink.

SPEED

    Let me read them.

LAUNCE

    Fie on thee, jolt-head! thou canst not read.

SPEED

    Thou liest; I can.

LAUNCE

    I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?

SPEED

    Marry, the son of my grandfather.

LAUNCE

    O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy
    grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.

SPEED

    Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.

LAUNCE

    There; and St. Nicholas be thy speed!

SPEED

    [Reads] 'Imprimis: She can milk.'

LAUNCE

    Ay, that she can.

SPEED

    'Item: She brews good ale.'

LAUNCE

    And thereof comes the proverb: 'Blessing of your
    heart, you brew good ale.'

SPEED

    'Item: She can sew.'

LAUNCE

    That's as much as to say, Can she so?

SPEED

    'Item: She can knit.'

LAUNCE

    What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when
    she can knit him a stock?

SPEED

    'Item: She can wash and scour.'

LAUNCE

    A special virtue: for then she need not be washed
    and scoured.

SPEED

    'Item: She can spin.'

LAUNCE

    Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can
    spin for her living.

SPEED

    'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'

LAUNCE

    That's as much as to say, bastard virtues; that,
    indeed, know not their fathers and therefore have no names.

SPEED

    'Here follow her vices.'

LAUNCE

    Close at the heels of her virtues.

SPEED

    'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect
    of her breath.'

LAUNCE

    Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.

SPEED

    'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'

LAUNCE

    That makes amends for her sour breath.

SPEED

    'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'

LAUNCE

    It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.

SPEED

    'Item: She is slow in words.'

LAUNCE

    O villain, that set this down among her vices! To
    be slow in words is a woman's only virtue: I pray
    thee, out with't, and place it for her chief virtue.

SPEED

    'Item: She is proud.'

LAUNCE

    Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy, and cannot
    be ta'en from her.

SPEED

    'Item: She hath no teeth.'

LAUNCE

    I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.

SPEED

    'Item: She is curst.'

LAUNCE

    Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.

SPEED

    'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'

LAUNCE

    If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I
    will; for good things should be praised.

SPEED

    'Item: She is too liberal.'

LAUNCE

    Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down she
    is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that
    I'll keep shut: now, of another thing she may, and
    that cannot I help. Well, proceed.

SPEED

    'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults
    than hairs, and more wealth than faults.'

LAUNCE

    Stop there; I'll have her: she was mine, and not
    mine, twice or thrice in that last article.
    Rehearse that once more.

SPEED

    'Item: She hath more hair than wit,'--

LAUNCE

    More hair than wit? It may be; I'll prove it. The
    cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it
    is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit
    is more than the wit, for the greater hides the
    less. What's next?

SPEED

    'And more faults than hairs,'--

LAUNCE

    That's monstrous: O, that that were out!

SPEED

    'And more wealth than faults.'

LAUNCE

    Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well,
    I'll have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is
    impossible,--

SPEED

    What then?

LAUNCE

    Why, then will I tell thee--that thy master stays
    for thee at the North-gate.

SPEED

    For me?

LAUNCE

    For thee! ay, who art thou? he hath stayed for a
    better man than thee.

SPEED

    And must I go to him?

LAUNCE

    Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long
    that going will scarce serve the turn.

SPEED

    Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!

    Exit

LAUNCE

    Now will he be swinged for reading my letter; an
    unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into
    secrets! I'll after, to rejoice in the boy's correction.

    Exit

SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.

    Enter DUKE and THURIO

DUKE

    Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
    Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.

THURIO

    Since his exile she hath despised me most,
    Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,
    That I am desperate of obtaining her.

DUKE

    This weak impress of love is as a figure
    Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
    Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
    A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
    And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.

    Enter PROTEUS
    How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
    According to our proclamation gone?

PROTEUS

    Gone, my good lord.

DUKE

    My daughter takes his going grievously.

PROTEUS

    A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.

DUKE

    So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
    Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
    For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
    Makes me the better to confer with thee.

PROTEUS

    Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
    Let me not live to look upon your grace.

DUKE

    Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
    The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.

PROTEUS

    I do, my lord.

DUKE

    And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
    How she opposes her against my will

PROTEUS

    She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.

DUKE

    Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
    What might we do to make the girl forget
    The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?

PROTEUS

    The best way is to slander Valentine
    With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,
    Three things that women highly hold in hate.

DUKE

    Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.

PROTEUS

    Ay, if his enemy deliver it:
    Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
    By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.

DUKE

    Then you must undertake to slander him.

PROTEUS

    And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
    'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
    Especially against his very friend.

DUKE

    Where your good word cannot advantage him,
    Your slander never can endamage him;
    Therefore the office is indifferent,
    Being entreated to it by your friend.

PROTEUS

    You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it
    By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,
    She shall not long continue love to him.
    But say this weed her love from Valentine,
    It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.

THURIO

    Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
    Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
    You must provide to bottom it on me;
    Which must be done by praising me as much
    As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.

DUKE

    And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
    Because we know, on Valentine's report,
    You are already Love's firm votary
    And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
    Upon this warrant shall you have access
    Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
    For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
    And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
    Where you may temper her by your persuasion
    To hate young Valentine and love my friend.

PROTEUS

    As much as I can do, I will effect:
    But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
    You must lay lime to tangle her desires
    By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
    Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.

DUKE

    Ay,
    Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.

PROTEUS

    Say that upon the altar of her beauty
    You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:
    Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
    Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
    That may discover such integrity:
    For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
    Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
    Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
    Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
    After your dire-lamenting elegies,
    Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
    With some sweet concert; to their instruments
    Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
    Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
    This, or else nothing, will inherit her.

DUKE

    This discipline shows thou hast been in love.

THURIO

    And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
    Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
    Let us into the city presently
    To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
    I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
    To give the onset to thy good advice.

DUKE

    About it, gentlemen!

PROTEUS

    We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,
    And afterward determine our proceedings.

DUKE

    Even now about it! I will pardon you.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. The frontiers of Mantua. A forest.

    Enter certain Outlaws

First Outlaw

    Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.

Second Outlaw

    If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.

    Enter VALENTINE and SPEED

Third Outlaw

    Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:
    If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.

SPEED

    Sir, we are undone; these are the villains
    That all the travellers do fear so much.

VALENTINE

    My friends,--

First Outlaw

    That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.

Second Outlaw

    Peace! we'll hear him.

Third Outlaw

    Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.

VALENTINE

    Then know that I have little wealth to lose:
    A man I am cross'd with adversity;
    My riches are these poor habiliments,
    Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
    You take the sum and substance that I have.

Second Outlaw

    Whither travel you?

VALENTINE

    To Verona.

First Outlaw

    Whence came you?

VALENTINE

    From Milan.

Third Outlaw

    Have you long sojourned there?

VALENTINE

    Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,
    If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.

First Outlaw

    What, were you banish'd thence?

VALENTINE

    I was.

Second Outlaw

    For what offence?

VALENTINE

    For that which now torments me to rehearse:
    I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;
    Bu t yet I slew him manfully in fight,
    Without false vantage or base treachery.

First Outlaw

    Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
    But were you banish'd for so small a fault?

VALENTINE

    I was, and held me glad of such a doom.

Second Outlaw

    Have you the tongues?

VALENTINE

    My youthful travel therein made me happy,
    Or else I often had been miserable.

Third Outlaw

    By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
    This fellow were a king for our wild faction!

First Outlaw

    We'll have him. Sirs, a word.

SPEED

    Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.

VALENTINE

    Peace, villain!

Second Outlaw

    Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?

VALENTINE

    Nothing but my fortune.

Third Outlaw

    Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
    Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
    Thrust from the company of awful men:
    Myself was from Verona banished
    For practising to steal away a lady,
    An heir, and near allied unto the duke.

Second Outlaw

    And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
    Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.

First Outlaw

    And I for such like petty crimes as these,
    But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,
    That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
    And partly, seeing you are beautified
    With goodly shape and by your own report
    A linguist and a man of such perfection
    As we do in our quality much want--

Second Outlaw

    Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
    Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
    Are you content to be our general?
    To make a virtue of necessity
    And live, as we do, in this wilderness?

Third Outlaw

    What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
    Say ay, and be the captain of us all:
    We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
    Love thee as our commander and our king.

First Outlaw

    But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.

Second Outlaw

    Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.

VALENTINE

    I take your offer and will live with you,
    Provided that you do no outrages
    On silly women or poor passengers.

Third Outlaw

    No, we detest such vile base practises.
    Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,
    And show thee all the treasure we have got,
    Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace, under SILVIA's chamber.

    Enter PROTEUS

PROTEUS

    Already have I been false to Valentine
    And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
    Under the colour of commending him,
    I have access my own love to prefer:
    But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
    To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
    When I protest true loyalty to her,
    She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
    When to her beauty I commend my vows,
    She bids me think how I have been forsworn
    In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
    And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
    The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
    Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
    The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
    But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,
    And give some evening music to her ear.

    Enter THURIO and Musicians

THURIO

    How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?

PROTEUS

    Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love
    Will creep in service where it cannot go.

THURIO

    Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.

PROTEUS

    Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.

THURIO

    Who? Silvia?

PROTEUS

    Ay, Silvia; for your sake.

THURIO

    I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
    Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.

    Enter, at a distance, Host, and JULIA in boy's clothes

Host

    Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I
    pray you, why is it?

JULIA

    Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.

Host

    Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where
    you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.

JULIA

    But shall I hear him speak?

Host

    Ay, that you shall.

JULIA

    That will be music.

    Music plays

Host

    Hark, hark!

JULIA

    Is he among these?

Host

    Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.
    SONG.
    Who is Silvia? what is she,
    That all our swains commend her?
    Holy, fair and wise is she;
    The heaven such grace did lend her,
    That she might admired be.
    Is she kind as she is fair?
    For beauty lives with kindness.
    Love doth to her eyes repair,
    To help him of his blindness,
    And, being help'd, inhabits there.
    Then to Silvia let us sing,
    That Silvia is excelling;
    She excels each mortal thing
    Upon the dull earth dwelling:
    To her let us garlands bring.

Host

    How now! are you sadder than you were before? How
    do you, man? the music likes you not.

JULIA

    You mistake; the musician likes me not.

Host

    Why, my pretty youth?

JULIA

    He plays false, father.

Host

    How? out of tune on the strings?

JULIA

    Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very
    heart-strings.

Host

    You have a quick ear.

JULIA

    Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.

Host

    I perceive you delight not in music.

JULIA

    Not a whit, when it jars so.

Host

    Hark, what fine change is in the music!

JULIA

    Ay, that change is the spite.

Host

    You would have them always play but one thing?

JULIA

    I would always have one play but one thing.
    But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
    Often resort unto this gentlewoman?

Host

    I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved
    her out of all nick.

JULIA

    Where is Launce?

Host

    Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his
    master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.

JULIA

    Peace! stand aside: the company parts.

PROTEUS

    Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead
    That you shall say my cunning drift excels.

THURIO

    Where meet we?

PROTEUS

    At Saint Gregory's well.

THURIO

    Farewell.

    Exeunt THURIO and Musicians

    Enter SILVIA above

PROTEUS

    Madam, good even to your ladyship.

SILVIA

    I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
    Who is that that spake?

PROTEUS

    One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
    You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.

SILVIA

    Sir Proteus, as I take it.

PROTEUS

    Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.

SILVIA

    What's your will?

PROTEUS

    That I may compass yours.

SILVIA

    You have your wish; my will is even this:
    That presently you hie you home to bed.
    Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!
    Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
    To be seduced by thy flattery,
    That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
    Return, return, and make thy love amends.
    For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
    I am so far from granting thy request
    That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
    And by and by intend to chide myself
    Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.

PROTEUS

    I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
    But she is dead.

JULIA

    [Aside] 'Twere false, if I should speak it;
    For I am sure she is not buried.

SILVIA

    Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
    Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,
    I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed
    To wrong him with thy importunacy?

PROTEUS

    I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.

SILVIA

    And so suppose am I; for in his grave
    Assure thyself my love is buried.

PROTEUS

    Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.

SILVIA

    Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
    Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.

JULIA

    [Aside] He heard not that.

PROTEUS

    Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
    Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
    The picture that is hanging in your chamber;
    To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:
    For since the substance of your perfect self
    Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;
    And to your shadow will I make true love.

JULIA

    [Aside] If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,
    deceive it,
    And make it but a shadow, as I am.

SILVIA

    I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
    But since your falsehood shall become you well
    To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
    Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:
    And so, good rest.

PROTEUS

    As wretches have o'ernight
    That wait for execution in the morn.

    Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA severally

JULIA

    Host, will you go?

Host

    By my halidom, I was fast asleep.

JULIA

    Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?

Host

    Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost
    day.

JULIA

    Not so; but it hath been the longest night
    That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same.

    Enter EGLAMOUR

EGLAMOUR

    This is the hour that Madam Silvia
    Entreated me to call and know her mind:
    There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.
    Madam, madam!

    Enter SILVIA above

SILVIA

    Who calls?

EGLAMOUR

    Your servant and your friend;
    One that attends your ladyship's command.

SILVIA

    Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.

EGLAMOUR

    As many, worthy lady, to yourself:
    According to your ladyship's impose,
    I am thus early come to know what service
    It is your pleasure to command me in.

SILVIA

    O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--
    Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--
    Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:
    Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
    I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,
    Nor how my father would enforce me marry
    Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
    Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say
    No grief did ever come so near thy heart
    As when thy lady and thy true love died,
    Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
    Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
    To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;
    And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
    I do desire thy worthy company,
    Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
    Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
    But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
    And on the justice of my flying hence,
    To keep me from a most unholy match,
    Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
    I do desire thee, even from a heart
    As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
    To bear me company and go with me:
    If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
    That I may venture to depart alone.

EGLAMOUR

    Madam, I pity much your grievances;
    Which since I know they virtuously are placed,
    I give consent to go along with you,
    Recking as little what betideth me
    As much I wish all good befortune you.
    When will you go?

SILVIA

    This evening coming.

EGLAMOUR

    Where shall I meet you?

SILVIA

    At Friar Patrick's cell,
    Where I intend holy confession.

EGLAMOUR

    I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.

SILVIA

    Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.

    Exeunt severally

SCENE IV. The same.

    Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog

LAUNCE

    When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,
    look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a
    puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
    four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
    I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
    'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
    him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
    and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
    steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
    O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
    in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
    one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
    as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
    more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
    I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I
    live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
    thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
    gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
    not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
    all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
    one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
    out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
    I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
    knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
    whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
    the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
    the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you
    wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
    of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
    his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
    stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
    been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
    he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
    Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
    trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
    Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
    do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
    water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
    thou ever see me do such a trick?

    Enter PROTEUS and JULIA

PROTEUS

    Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
    And will employ thee in some service presently.

JULIA

    In what you please: I'll do what I can.

PROTEUS

    I hope thou wilt.

    To LAUNCE
    How now, you whoreson peasant!
    Where have you been these two days loitering?

LAUNCE

    Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.

PROTEUS

    And what says she to my little jewel?

LAUNCE

    Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you
    currish thanks is good enough for such a present.

PROTEUS

    But she received my dog?

LAUNCE

    No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him
    back again.

PROTEUS

    What, didst thou offer her this from me?

LAUNCE

    Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by
    the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
    offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
    yours, and therefore the gift the greater.

PROTEUS

    Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,
    Or ne'er return again into my sight.
    Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?

    Exit LAUNCE
    A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
    Sebastian, I have entertained thee,
    Partly that I have need of such a youth
    That can with some discretion do my business,
    For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
    But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,
    Which, if my augury deceive me not,
    Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:
    Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.
    Go presently and take this ring with thee,
    Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
    She loved me well deliver'd it to me.

JULIA

    It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
    She is dead, belike?

PROTEUS

    Not so; I think she lives.

JULIA

    Alas!

PROTEUS

    Why dost thou cry 'alas'?

JULIA

    I cannot choose
    But pity her.

PROTEUS

    Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?

JULIA

    Because methinks that she loved you as well
    As you do love your lady Silvia:
    She dreams of him that has forgot her love;
    You dote on her that cares not for your love.
    'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
    And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'

PROTEUS

    Well, give her that ring and therewithal
    This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
    I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
    Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
    Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.

    Exit

JULIA

    How many women would do such a message?
    Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
    A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
    Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
    That with his very heart despiseth me?
    Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
    Because I love him I must pity him.
    This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
    To bind him to remember my good will;
    And now am I, unhappy messenger,
    To plead for that which I would not obtain,
    To carry that which I would have refused,
    To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
    I am my master's true-confirmed love;
    But cannot be true servant to my master,
    Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
    Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
    As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.

    Enter SILVIA, attended
    Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
    To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.

SILVIA

    What would you with her, if that I be she?

JULIA

    If you be she, I do entreat your patience
    To hear me speak the message I am sent on.

SILVIA

    From whom?

JULIA

    From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.

SILVIA

    O, he sends you for a picture.

JULIA

    Ay, madam.

SILVIA

    Ursula, bring my picture here.
    Go give your master this: tell him from me,
    One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
    Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.

JULIA

    Madam, please you peruse this letter.--
    Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised
    Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
    This is the letter to your ladyship.

SILVIA

    I pray thee, let me look on that again.

JULIA

    It may not be; good madam, pardon me.

SILVIA

    There, hold!
    I will not look upon your master's lines:
    I know they are stuff'd with protestations
    And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
    As easily as I do tear his paper.

JULIA

    Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.

SILVIA

    The more shame for him that he sends it me;
    For I have heard him say a thousand times
    His Julia gave it him at his departure.
    Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
    Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.

JULIA

    She thanks you.

SILVIA

    What say'st thou?

JULIA

    I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
    Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.

SILVIA

    Dost thou know her?

JULIA

    Almost as well as I do know myself:
    To think upon her woes I do protest
    That I have wept a hundred several times.

SILVIA

    Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.

JULIA

    I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.

SILVIA

    Is she not passing fair?

JULIA

    She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
    When she did think my master loved her well,
    She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:
    But since she did neglect her looking-glass
    And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
    The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
    And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
    That now she is become as black as I.

SILVIA

    How tall was she?

JULIA

    About my stature; for at Pentecost,
    When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
    Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
    And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
    Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
    As if the garment had been made for me:
    Therefore I know she is about my height.
    And at that time I made her weep agood,
    For I did play a lamentable part:
    Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
    For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
    Which I so lively acted with my tears
    That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
    Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
    If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!

SILVIA

    She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
    Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
    I weep myself to think upon thy words.
    Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
    For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
    Farewell.

    Exit SILVIA, with attendants

JULIA

    And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
    A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful
    I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
    Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
    Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
    Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
    If I had such a tire, this face of mine
    Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
    And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
    Unless I flatter with myself too much.
    Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
    If that be all the difference in his love,
    I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
    Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
    Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
    What should it be that he respects in her
    But I can make respective in myself,
    If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
    Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,
    For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
    Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
    And, were there sense in his idolatry,
    My substance should be statue in thy stead.
    I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
    That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
    I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
    To make my master out of love with thee!

    Exit

ACT V
SCENE I. Milan. An abbey.

    Enter EGLAMOUR

EGLAMOUR

    The sun begins to gild the western sky;
    And now it is about the very hour
    That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.
    She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
    Unless it be to come before their time;
    So much they spur their expedition.
    See where she comes.

    Enter SILVIA
    Lady, a happy evening!

SILVIA

    Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
    Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
    I fear I am attended by some spies.

EGLAMOUR

    Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;
    If we recover that, we are sure enough.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. The DUKE's palace.

    Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA

THURIO

    Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?

PROTEUS

    O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
    And yet she takes exceptions at your person.

THURIO

    What, that my leg is too long?

PROTEUS

    No; that it is too little.

THURIO

    I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.

JULIA

    [Aside] But love will not be spurr'd to what
    it loathes.

THURIO

    What says she to my face?

PROTEUS

    She says it is a fair one.

THURIO

    Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.

PROTEUS

    But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
    Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.

JULIA

    [Aside] 'Tis true; such pearls as put out
    ladies' eyes;
    For I had rather wink than look on them.

THURIO

    How likes she my discourse?

PROTEUS

    Ill, when you talk of war.

THURIO

    But well, when I discourse of love and peace?

JULIA

    [Aside] But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.

THURIO

    What says she to my valour?

PROTEUS

    O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.

JULIA

    [Aside] She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.

THURIO

    What says she to my birth?

PROTEUS

    That you are well derived.

JULIA

    [Aside] True; from a gentleman to a fool.

THURIO

    Considers she my possessions?

PROTEUS

    O, ay; and pities them.

THURIO

    Wherefore?

JULIA

    [Aside] That such an ass should owe them.

PROTEUS

    That they are out by lease.

JULIA

    Here comes the duke.

    Enter DUKE

DUKE

    How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!
    Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?

THURIO

    Not I.

PROTEUS

    Nor I.

DUKE

    Saw you my daughter?

PROTEUS

    Neither.

DUKE

    Why then,
    She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
    And Eglamour is in her company.
    'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
    As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
    Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
    But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
    Besides, she did intend confession
    At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
    These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
    Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
    But mount you presently and meet with me
    Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
    That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:
    Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.

    Exit

THURIO

    Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
    That flies her fortune when it follows her.
    I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
    Than for the love of reckless Silvia.

    Exit

PROTEUS

    And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
    Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.

    Exit

JULIA

    And I will follow, more to cross that love
    Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.

    Exit

SCENE III. The frontiers of Mantua. The forest.

    Enter Outlaws with SILVIA

First Outlaw

    Come, come,
    Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.

SILVIA

    A thousand more mischances than this one
    Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.

Second Outlaw

    Come, bring her away.

First Outlaw

    Where is the gentleman that was with her?

Third Outlaw

    Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
    But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
    Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
    There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;
    The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.

First Outlaw

    Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:
    Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
    And will not use a woman lawlessly.

SILVIA

    O Valentine, this I endure for thee!

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.

    Enter VALENTINE

VALENTINE

    How use doth breed a habit in a man!
    This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
    I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
    Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
    And to the nightingale's complaining notes
    Tune my distresses and record my woes.
    O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
    Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
    Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
    And leave no memory of what it was!
    Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;
    Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
    What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
    These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
    Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
    They love me well; yet I have much to do
    To keep them from uncivil outrages.
    Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?

    Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA

PROTEUS

    Madam, this service I have done for you,
    Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
    To hazard life and rescue you from him
    That would have forced your honour and your love;
    Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
    A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
    And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.

VALENTINE

    [Aside] How like a dream is this I see and hear!
    Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.

SILVIA

    O miserable, unhappy that I am!

PROTEUS

    Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
    But by my coming I have made you happy.

SILVIA

    By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.

JULIA

    [Aside] And me, when he approacheth to your presence.

SILVIA

    Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
    I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
    Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
    O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
    Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
    And full as much, for more there cannot be,
    I do detest false perjured Proteus.
    Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.

PROTEUS

    What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
    Would I not undergo for one calm look!
    O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
    When women cannot love where they're beloved!

SILVIA

    When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
    Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
    For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
    Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
    Descended into perjury, to love me.
    Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;
    And that's far worse than none; better have none
    Than plural faith which is too much by one:
    Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!

PROTEUS

    In love
    Who respects friend?

SILVIA

    All men but Proteus.

PROTEUS

    Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
    Can no way change you to a milder form,
    I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
    And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.

SILVIA

    O heaven!

PROTEUS

    I'll force thee yield to my desire.

VALENTINE

    Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
    Thou friend of an ill fashion!

PROTEUS

    Valentine!

VALENTINE

    Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
    For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
    Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
    Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
    I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
    Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
    Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
    I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
    But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
    The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
    'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!

PROTEUS

    My shame and guilt confounds me.
    Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
    Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
    I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer
    As e'er I did commit.

VALENTINE

    Then I am paid;
    And once again I do receive thee honest.
    Who by repentance is not satisfied
    Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
    By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
    And, that my love may appear plain and free,
    All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.

JULIA

    O me unhappy!

    Swoons

PROTEUS

    Look to the boy.

VALENTINE

    Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?
    Look up; speak.

JULIA

    O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring
    to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.

PROTEUS

    Where is that ring, boy?

JULIA

    Here 'tis; this is it.

PROTEUS

    How! let me see:
    Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.

JULIA

    O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
    This is the ring you sent to Silvia.

PROTEUS

    But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
    I gave this unto Julia.

JULIA

    And Julia herself did give it me;
    And Julia herself hath brought it hither.

PROTEUS

    How! Julia!

JULIA

    Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
    And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
    How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
    O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
    Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
    Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
    In a disguise of love:
    It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
    Women to change their shapes than men their minds.

PROTEUS

    Than men their minds! 'tis true.
    O heaven! were man
    But constant, he were perfect. That one error
    Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
    Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
    What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
    More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?

VALENTINE

    Come, come, a hand from either:
    Let me be blest to make this happy close;
    'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.

PROTEUS

    Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.

JULIA

    And I mine.

    Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO

Outlaws

    A prize, a prize, a prize!

VALENTINE

    Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.
    Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
    Banished Valentine.

DUKE

    Sir Valentine!

THURIO

    Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.

VALENTINE

    Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
    Come not within the measure of my wrath;
    Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
    Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
    Take but possession of her with a touch:
    I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.

THURIO

    Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
    I hold him but a fool that will endanger
    His body for a girl that loves him not:
    I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.

DUKE

    The more degenerate and base art thou,
    To make such means for her as thou hast done
    And leave her on such slight conditions.
    Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
    I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
    And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
    Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
    Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
    Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
    To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
    Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
    Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.

VALENTINE

    I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.
    I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
    To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.

DUKE

    I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.

VALENTINE

    These banish'd men that I have kept withal
    Are men endued with worthy qualities:
    Forgive them what they have committed here
    And let them be recall'd from their exile:
    They are reformed, civil, full of good
    And fit for great employment, worthy lord.

DUKE

    Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:
    Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
    Come, let us go: we will include all jars
    With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.

VALENTINE

    And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
    With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
    What think you of this page, my lord?

DUKE

    I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.

VALENTINE

    I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.

DUKE

    What mean you by that saying?

VALENTINE

    Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
    That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
    Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
    The story of your loves discovered:
    That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
    One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.

    Exeunt


Winter's Tale

ACT I
SCENE I. Antechamber in LEONTES' palace.

    Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS

ARCHIDAMUS

    If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
    the like occasion whereon my services are now on
    foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
    difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.

CAMILLO

    I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
    means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.

ARCHIDAMUS

    Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
    justified in our loves; for indeed--

CAMILLO

    Beseech you,--

ARCHIDAMUS

    Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
    we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
    not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
    that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
    may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
    us.

CAMILLO

    You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.

ARCHIDAMUS

    Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
    and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.

CAMILLO

    Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
    They were trained together in their childhoods; and
    there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
    which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
    more mature dignities and royal necessities made
    separation of their society, their encounters,
    though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
    with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
    embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
    though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
    embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
    winds. The heavens continue their loves!

ARCHIDAMUS

    I think there is not in the world either malice or
    matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
    comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
    gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
    into my note.

CAMILLO

    I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
    is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
    subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
    crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
    see him a man.

ARCHIDAMUS

    Would they else be content to die?

CAMILLO

    Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
    desire to live.

ARCHIDAMUS

    If the king had no son, they would desire to live
    on crutches till he had one.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room of state in the same.

    Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants

POLIXENES

    Nine changes of the watery star hath been
    The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
    Without a burthen: time as long again
    Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
    And yet we should, for perpetuity,
    Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
    Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
    With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
    That go before it.

LEONTES

    Stay your thanks a while;
    And pay them when you part.

POLIXENES

    Sir, that's to-morrow.
    I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
    Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
    No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
    'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
    To tire your royalty.

LEONTES

    We are tougher, brother,
    Than you can put us to't.

POLIXENES

    No longer stay.

LEONTES

    One seven-night longer.

POLIXENES

    Very sooth, to-morrow.

LEONTES

    We'll part the time between's then; and in that
    I'll no gainsaying.

POLIXENES

    Press me not, beseech you, so.
    There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
    So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
    Were there necessity in your request, although
    'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
    Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
    Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
    To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
    Farewell, our brother.

LEONTES

    Tongue-tied, our queen?
    speak you.

HERMIONE

    I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
    You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
    Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
    All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
    The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
    He's beat from his best ward.

LEONTES

    Well said, Hermione.

HERMIONE

    To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
    But let him say so then, and let him go;
    But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
    We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
    Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
    The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
    You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
    To let him there a month behind the gest
    Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
    I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
    What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?

POLIXENES

    No, madam.

HERMIONE

    Nay, but you will?

POLIXENES

    I may not, verily.

HERMIONE

    Verily!
    You put me off with limber vows; but I,
    Though you would seek to unsphere the
    stars with oaths,
    Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
    You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
    As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
    Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
    Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
    When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
    My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
    One of them you shall be.

POLIXENES

    Your guest, then, madam:
    To be your prisoner should import offending;
    Which is for me less easy to commit
    Than you to punish.

HERMIONE

    Not your gaoler, then,
    But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
    Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
    You were pretty lordings then?

POLIXENES

    We were, fair queen,
    Two lads that thought there was no more behind
    But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
    And to be boy eternal.

HERMIONE

    Was not my lord
    The verier wag o' the two?

POLIXENES

    We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
    And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
    Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
    The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
    That any did. Had we pursued that life,
    And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
    With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
    Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
    Hereditary ours.

HERMIONE

    By this we gather
    You have tripp'd since.

POLIXENES

    O my most sacred lady!
    Temptations have since then been born to's; for
    In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
    Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
    Of my young play-fellow.

HERMIONE

    Grace to boot!
    Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
    Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
    The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
    If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
    You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
    With any but with us.

LEONTES

    Is he won yet?

HERMIONE

    He'll stay my lord.

LEONTES

    At my request he would not.
    Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
    To better purpose.

HERMIONE

    Never?

LEONTES

    Never, but once.

HERMIONE

    What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
    I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
    As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
    Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
    Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
    With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
    With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
    My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
    What was my first? it has an elder sister,
    Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
    But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
    Nay, let me have't; I long.

LEONTES

    Why, that was when
    Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
    Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
    And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
    'I am yours for ever.'

HERMIONE

    'Tis grace indeed.
    Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
    The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
    The other for some while a friend.

LEONTES

    [Aside] Too hot, too hot!
    To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
    I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;
    But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
    May a free face put on, derive a liberty
    From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
    And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;
    But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
    As now they are, and making practised smiles,
    As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere
    The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment
    My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,
    Art thou my boy?

MAMILLIUS

    Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES

    I' fecks!
    Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
    smutch'd thy nose?
    They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
    We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
    And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
    Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
    Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
    Art thou my calf?

MAMILLIUS

    Yes, if you will, my lord.

LEONTES

    Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
    To be full like me: yet they say we are
    Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
    That will say anything but were they false
    As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
    As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
    No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
    To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
    Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
    Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
    Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
    Thou dost make possible things not so held,
    Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
    With what's unreal thou coactive art,
    And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
    Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
    And that beyond commission, and I find it,
    And that to the infection of my brains
    And hardening of my brows.

POLIXENES

    What means Sicilia?

HERMIONE

    He something seems unsettled.

POLIXENES

    How, my lord!
    What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?

HERMIONE

    You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
    Are you moved, my lord?

LEONTES

    No, in good earnest.
    How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
    Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
    To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
    Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
    Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
    In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
    Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
    As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
    How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
    This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
    Will you take eggs for money?

MAMILLIUS

    No, my lord, I'll fight.

LEONTES

    You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
    Are you so fond of your young prince as we
    Do seem to be of ours?

POLIXENES

    If at home, sir,
    He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
    Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
    My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
    He makes a July's day short as December,
    And with his varying childness cures in me
    Thoughts that would thick my blood.

LEONTES

    So stands this squire
    Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
    And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
    How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
    Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
    Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
    Apparent to my heart.

HERMIONE

    If you would seek us,
    We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?

LEONTES

    To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
    Be you beneath the sky.

    Aside
    I am angling now,
    Though you perceive me not how I give line.
    Go to, go to!
    How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
    And arms her with the boldness of a wife
    To her allowing husband!

    Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants
    Gone already!
    Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
    ears a fork'd one!
    Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
    Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
    Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
    Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
    There have been,
    Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
    And many a man there is, even at this present,
    Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
    That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
    And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
    Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
    Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
    As mine, against their will. Should all despair
    That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
    Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
    It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
    Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
    From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
    No barricado for a belly; know't;
    It will let in and out the enemy
    With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
    Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!

MAMILLIUS

    I am like you, they say.

LEONTES

    Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?

CAMILLO

    Ay, my good lord.

LEONTES

    Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.

    Exit MAMILLIUS
    Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.

CAMILLO

    You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
    When you cast out, it still came home.

LEONTES

    Didst note it?

CAMILLO

    He would not stay at your petitions: made
    His business more material.

LEONTES

    Didst perceive it?

    Aside
    They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
    'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
    When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
    That he did stay?

CAMILLO

    At the good queen's entreaty.

LEONTES

    At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
    But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
    By any understanding pate but thine?
    For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
    More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
    But of the finer natures? by some severals
    Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
    Perchance are to this business purblind? say.

CAMILLO

    Business, my lord! I think most understand
    Bohemia stays here longer.

LEONTES

    Ha!

CAMILLO

    Stays here longer.

LEONTES

    Ay, but why?

CAMILLO

    To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
    Of our most gracious mistress.

LEONTES

    Satisfy!
    The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
    Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
    With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
    My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
    Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
    Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
    Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
    In that which seems so.

CAMILLO

    Be it forbid, my lord!

LEONTES

    To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
    If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
    Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
    From course required; or else thou must be counted
    A servant grafted in my serious trust
    And therein negligent; or else a fool
    That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
    And takest it all for jest.

CAMILLO

    My gracious lord,
    I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
    In every one of these no man is free,
    But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
    Among the infinite doings of the world,
    Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
    If ever I were wilful-negligent,
    It was my folly; if industriously
    I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
    Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
    To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
    Where of the execution did cry out
    Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
    Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
    Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
    Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
    Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
    By its own visage: if I then deny it,
    'Tis none of mine.

LEONTES

    Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
    But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
    Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
    For to a vision so apparent rumour
    Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
    Resides not in that man that does not think,--
    My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
    Or else be impudently negative,
    To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
    My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
    As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
    Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.

CAMILLO

    I would not be a stander-by to hear
    My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
    My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
    You never spoke what did become you less
    Than this; which to reiterate were sin
    As deep as that, though true.

LEONTES

    Is whispering nothing?
    Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
    Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
    Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
    Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
    Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
    Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
    Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
    That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
    Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
    The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
    My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
    If this be nothing.

CAMILLO

    Good my lord, be cured
    Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
    For 'tis most dangerous.

LEONTES

    Say it be, 'tis true.

CAMILLO

    No, no, my lord.

LEONTES

    It is; you lie, you lie:
    I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
    Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
    Or else a hovering temporizer, that
    Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
    Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
    Infected as her life, she would not live
    The running of one glass.

CAMILLO

    Who does infect her?

LEONTES

    Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
    About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
    Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
    To see alike mine honour as their profits,
    Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
    Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
    His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
    Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
    Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
    How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
    To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
    Which draught to me were cordial.

CAMILLO

    Sir, my lord,
    I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
    But with a lingering dram that should not work
    Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
    Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
    So sovereignly being honourable.
    I have loved thee,--

LEONTES

    Make that thy question, and go rot!
    Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
    To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
    The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
    Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
    Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
    Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
    Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
    Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
    Could man so blench?

CAMILLO

    I must believe you, sir:
    I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
    Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
    Will take again your queen as yours at first,
    Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
    The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
    Known and allied to yours.

LEONTES

    Thou dost advise me
    Even so as I mine own course have set down:
    I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.

CAMILLO

    My lord,
    Go then; and with a countenance as clear
    As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
    And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
    If from me he have wholesome beverage,
    Account me not your servant.

LEONTES

    This is all:
    Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
    Do't not, thou split'st thine own.

CAMILLO

    I'll do't, my lord.

LEONTES

    I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.

    Exit

CAMILLO

    O miserable lady! But, for me,
    What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
    Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
    Is the obedience to a master, one
    Who in rebellion with himself will have
    All that are his so too. To do this deed,
    Promotion follows. If I could find example
    Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
    And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
    Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
    Let villany itself forswear't. I must
    Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
    To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
    Here comes Bohemia.

    Re-enter POLIXENES

POLIXENES

    This is strange: methinks
    My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
    Good day, Camillo.

CAMILLO

    Hail, most royal sir!

POLIXENES

    What is the news i' the court?

CAMILLO

    None rare, my lord.

POLIXENES

    The king hath on him such a countenance
    As he had lost some province and a region
    Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
    With customary compliment; when he,
    Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
    A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
    So leaves me to consider what is breeding
    That changeth thus his manners.

CAMILLO

    I dare not know, my lord.

POLIXENES

    How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
    Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
    For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
    And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
    Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
    Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
    A party in this alteration, finding
    Myself thus alter'd with 't.

CAMILLO

    There is a sickness
    Which puts some of us in distemper, but
    I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
    Of you that yet are well.

POLIXENES

    How! caught of me!
    Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
    I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
    By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
    As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
    Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
    Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
    In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
    If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
    Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
    In ignorant concealment.

CAMILLO

    I may not answer.

POLIXENES

    A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
    I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
    I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
    Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
    Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
    What incidency thou dost guess of harm
    Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
    Which way to be prevented, if to be;
    If not, how best to bear it.

CAMILLO

    Sir, I will tell you;
    Since I am charged in honour and by him
    That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
    Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
    I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
    Cry lost, and so good night!

POLIXENES

    On, good Camillo.

CAMILLO

    I am appointed him to murder you.

POLIXENES

    By whom, Camillo?

CAMILLO

    By the king.

POLIXENES

    For what?

CAMILLO

    He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
    As he had seen't or been an instrument
    To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
    Forbiddenly.

POLIXENES

    O, then my best blood turn
    To an infected jelly and my name
    Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
    Turn then my freshest reputation to
    A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
    Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
    Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
    That e'er was heard or read!

CAMILLO

    Swear his thought over
    By each particular star in heaven and
    By all their influences, you may as well
    Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
    As or by oath remove or counsel shake
    The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
    Is piled upon his faith and will continue
    The standing of his body.

POLIXENES

    How should this grow?

CAMILLO

    I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
    Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
    If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
    That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
    Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
    Your followers I will whisper to the business,
    And will by twos and threes at several posterns
    Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
    My fortunes to your service, which are here
    By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
    For, by the honour of my parents, I
    Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
    I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
    Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
    His execution sworn.

POLIXENES

    I do believe thee:
    I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
    Be pilot to me and thy places shall
    Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
    My people did expect my hence departure
    Two days ago. This jealousy
    Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
    Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
    Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
    He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
    Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
    In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
    Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
    The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
    Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
    I will respect thee as a father if
    Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.

CAMILLO

    It is in mine authority to command
    The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
    To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.

    Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies

HERMIONE

    Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
    'Tis past enduring.

First Lady

    Come, my gracious lord,
    Shall I be your playfellow?

MAMILLIUS

    No, I'll none of you.

First Lady

    Why, my sweet lord?

MAMILLIUS

    You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
    I were a baby still. I love you better.

Second Lady

    And why so, my lord?

MAMILLIUS

    Not for because
    Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
    Become some women best, so that there be not
    Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
    Or a half-moon made with a pen.

Second Lady

    Who taught you this?

MAMILLIUS

    I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
    What colour are your eyebrows?

First Lady

    Blue, my lord.

MAMILLIUS

    Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
    That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.

First Lady

    Hark ye;
    The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
    Present our services to a fine new prince
    One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
    If we would have you.

Second Lady

    She is spread of late
    Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!

HERMIONE

    What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
    I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
    And tell 's a tale.

MAMILLIUS

    Merry or sad shall't be?

HERMIONE

    As merry as you will.

MAMILLIUS

    A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
    Of sprites and goblins.

HERMIONE

    Let's have that, good sir.
    Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
    To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.

MAMILLIUS

    There was a man--

HERMIONE

    Nay, come, sit down; then on.

MAMILLIUS

    Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
    Yond crickets shall not hear it.

HERMIONE

    Come on, then,
    And give't me in mine ear.

    Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others

LEONTES

    Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?

First Lord

    Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
    Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
    Even to their ships.

LEONTES

    How blest am I
    In my just censure, in my true opinion!
    Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
    In being so blest! There may be in the cup
    A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
    And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
    Is not infected: but if one present
    The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
    How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
    With violent hefts. I have drunk,
    and seen the spider.
    Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
    There is a plot against my life, my crown;
    All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
    Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
    He has discover'd my design, and I
    Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
    For them to play at will. How came the posterns
    So easily open?

First Lord

    By his great authority;
    Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
    On your command.

LEONTES

    I know't too well.
    Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
    Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
    Have too much blood in him.

HERMIONE

    What is this? sport?

LEONTES

    Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
    Away with him! and let her sport herself
    With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
    Has made thee swell thus.

HERMIONE

    But I'ld say he had not,
    And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
    Howe'er you lean to the nayward.

LEONTES

    You, my lords,
    Look on her, mark her well; be but about
    To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
    The justice of your bearts will thereto add
    'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
    Praise her but for this her without-door form,
    Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
    The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
    That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
    That mercy does, for calumny will sear
    Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
    When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
    Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
    From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
    She's an adulteress.

HERMIONE

    Should a villain say so,
    The most replenish'd villain in the world,
    He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
    Do but mistake.

LEONTES

    You have mistook, my lady,
    Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
    Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
    Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
    Should a like language use to all degrees
    And mannerly distinguishment leave out
    Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
    She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
    More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
    A federary with her, and one that knows
    What she should shame to know herself
    But with her most vile principal, that she's
    A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
    That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
    To this their late escape.

HERMIONE

    No, by my life.
    Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
    When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
    You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
    You scarce can right me throughly then to say
    You did mistake.

LEONTES

    No; if I mistake
    In those foundations which I build upon,
    The centre is not big enough to bear
    A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
    He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
    But that he speaks.

HERMIONE

    There's some ill planet reigns:
    I must be patient till the heavens look
    With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
    I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
    Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
    Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
    That honourable grief lodged here which burns
    Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
    With thoughts so qualified as your charities
    Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
    The king's will be perform'd!

LEONTES

    Shall I be heard?

HERMIONE

    Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
    My women may be with me; for you see
    My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
    There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
    Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
    As I come out: this action I now go on
    Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
    I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
    I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.

LEONTES

    Go, do our bidding; hence!

    Exit HERMIONE, guarded; with Ladies

First Lord

    Beseech your highness, call the queen again.

ANTIGONUS

    Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
    Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
    Yourself, your queen, your son.

First Lord

    For her, my lord,
    I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
    Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
    I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
    In this which you accuse her.

ANTIGONUS

    If it prove
    She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
    I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
    Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
    For every inch of woman in the world,
    Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.

LEONTES

    Hold your peaces.

First Lord

    Good my lord,--

ANTIGONUS

    It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
    You are abused and by some putter-on
    That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
    I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
    I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
    The second and the third, nine, and some five;
    If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
    by mine honour,
    I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
    To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
    And I had rather glib myself than they
    Should not produce fair issue.

LEONTES

    Cease; no more.
    You smell this business with a sense as cold
    As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
    As you feel doing thus; and see withal
    The instruments that feel.

ANTIGONUS

    If it be so,
    We need no grave to bury honesty:
    There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
    Of the whole dungy earth.

LEONTES

    What! lack I credit?

First Lord

    I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
    Upon this ground; and more it would content me
    To have her honour true than your suspicion,
    Be blamed for't how you might.

LEONTES

    Why, what need we
    Commune with you of this, but rather follow
    Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
    Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
    Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
    Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
    Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
    We need no more of your advice: the matter,
    The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
    Properly ours.

ANTIGONUS

    And I wish, my liege,
    You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
    Without more overture.

LEONTES

    How could that be?
    Either thou art most ignorant by age,
    Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
    Added to their familiarity,
    Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
    That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
    But only seeing, all other circumstances
    Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
    Yet, for a greater confirmation,
    For in an act of this importance 'twere
    Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
    To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
    Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
    Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
    They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
    Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?

First Lord

    Well done, my lord.

LEONTES

    Though I am satisfied and need no more
    Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
    Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
    Whose ignorant credulity will not
    Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
    From our free person she should be confined,
    Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
    Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
    We are to speak in public; for this business
    Will raise us all.

ANTIGONUS

    [Aside]
    To laughter, as I take it,
    If the good truth were known.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A prison.

    Enter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants

PAULINA

    The keeper of the prison, call to him;
    let him have knowledge who I am.

    Exit Gentleman
    Good lady,
    No court in Europe is too good for thee;
    What dost thou then in prison?

    Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler
    Now, good sir,
    You know me, do you not?

Gaoler

    For a worthy lady
    And one whom much I honour.

PAULINA

    Pray you then,
    Conduct me to the queen.

Gaoler

    I may not, madam:
    To the contrary I have express commandment.

PAULINA

    Here's ado,
    To lock up honesty and honour from
    The access of gentle visitors!
    Is't lawful, pray you,
    To see her women? any of them? Emilia?

Gaoler

    So please you, madam,
    To put apart these your attendants, I
    Shall bring Emilia forth.

PAULINA

    I pray now, call her.
    Withdraw yourselves.

    Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants

Gaoler

    And, madam,
    I must be present at your conference.

PAULINA

    Well, be't so, prithee.

    Exit Gaoler
    Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
    As passes colouring.

    Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA
    Dear gentlewoman,
    How fares our gracious lady?

EMILIA

    As well as one so great and so forlorn
    May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
    Which never tender lady hath born greater,
    She is something before her time deliver'd.

PAULINA

    A boy?

EMILIA

    A daughter, and a goodly babe,
    Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
    Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
    I am innocent as you.'

PAULINA

    I dare be sworn
    These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
    beshrew them!
    He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
    Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
    If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
    And never to my red-look'd anger be
    The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
    Commend my best obedience to the queen:
    If she dares trust me with her little babe,
    I'll show't the king and undertake to be
    Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
    How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
    The silence often of pure innocence
    Persuades when speaking fails.

EMILIA

    Most worthy madam,
    Your honour and your goodness is so evident
    That your free undertaking cannot miss
    A thriving issue: there is no lady living
    So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
    To visit the next room, I'll presently
    Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
    Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
    But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
    Lest she should be denied.

PAULINA

    Tell her, Emilia.
    I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
    As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
    I shall do good.

EMILIA

    Now be you blest for it!
    I'll to the queen: please you,
    come something nearer.

Gaoler

    Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,
    I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
    Having no warrant.

PAULINA

    You need not fear it, sir:
    This child was prisoner to the womb and is
    By law and process of great nature thence
    Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
    The anger of the king nor guilty of,
    If any be, the trespass of the queen.

Gaoler

    I do believe it.

PAULINA

    Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
    I will stand betwixt you and danger.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in LEONTES' palace.

    Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants

LEONTES

    Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
    To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
    The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
    She the adulteress; for the harlot king
    Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
    And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
    I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
    Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
    Might come to me again. Who's there?

First Servant

    My lord?

LEONTES

    How does the boy?

First Servant

    He took good rest to-night;
    'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.

LEONTES

    To see his nobleness!
    Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
    He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
    Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
    Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
    And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
    See how he fares.

    Exit Servant
    Fie, fie! no thought of him:
    The thought of my revenges that way
    Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
    And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
    Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
    Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
    Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
    They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
    Shall she within my power.

    Enter PAULINA, with a child

First Lord

    You must not enter.

PAULINA

    Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
    Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
    Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
    More free than he is jealous.

ANTIGONUS

    That's enough.

Second Servant

    Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
    None should come at him.

PAULINA

    Not so hot, good sir:
    I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
    That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
    At each his needless heavings, such as you
    Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
    Do come with words as medicinal as true,
    Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
    That presses him from sleep.

LEONTES

    What noise there, ho?

PAULINA

    No noise, my lord; but needful conference
    About some gossips for your highness.

LEONTES

    How!
    Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
    I charged thee that she should not come about me:
    I knew she would.

ANTIGONUS

    I told her so, my lord,
    On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
    She should not visit you.

LEONTES

    What, canst not rule her?

PAULINA

    From all dishonesty he can: in this,
    Unless he take the course that you have done,
    Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
    He shall not rule me.

ANTIGONUS

    La you now, you hear:
    When she will take the rein I let her run;
    But she'll not stumble.

PAULINA

    Good my liege, I come;
    And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
    Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
    Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
    Less appear so in comforting your evils,
    Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
    From your good queen.

LEONTES

    Good queen!

PAULINA

    Good queen, my lord,
    Good queen; I say good queen;
    And would by combat make her good, so were I
    A man, the worst about you.

LEONTES

    Force her hence.

PAULINA

    Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
    First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
    But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
    For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
    Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.

    Laying down the child

LEONTES

    Out!
    A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
    A most intelligencing bawd!

PAULINA

    Not so:
    I am as ignorant in that as you
    In so entitling me, and no less honest
    Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
    As this world goes, to pass for honest.

LEONTES

    Traitors!
    Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
    Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
    By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
    Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.

PAULINA

    For ever
    Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
    Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
    Which he has put upon't!

LEONTES

    He dreads his wife.

PAULINA

    So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
    You'ld call your children yours.

LEONTES

    A nest of traitors!

ANTIGONUS

    I am none, by this good light.

PAULINA

    Nor I, nor any
    But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
    The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
    His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
    Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;
    and will not--
    For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
    He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
    The root of his opinion, which is rotten
    As ever oak or stone was sound.

LEONTES

    A callat
    Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
    And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
    It is the issue of Polixenes:
    Hence with it, and together with the dam
    Commit them to the fire!

PAULINA

    It is yours;
    And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
    So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
    Although the print be little, the whole matter
    And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
    The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
    The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
    His smiles,
    The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
    And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
    So like to him that got it, if thou hast
    The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
    No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
    Her children not her husband's!

LEONTES

    A gross hag
    And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
    That wilt not stay her tongue.

ANTIGONUS

    Hang all the husbands
    That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
    Hardly one subject.

LEONTES

    Once more, take her hence.

PAULINA

    A most unworthy and unnatural lord
    Can do no more.

LEONTES

    I'll ha' thee burnt.

PAULINA

    I care not:
    It is an heretic that makes the fire,
    Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
    But this most cruel usage of your queen,
    Not able to produce more accusation
    Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
    Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
    Yea, scandalous to the world.

LEONTES

    On your allegiance,
    Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
    Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
    If she did know me one. Away with her!

PAULINA

    I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
    Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:
    Jove send her
    A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
    You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
    Will never do him good, not one of you.
    So, so: farewell; we are gone.

    Exit

LEONTES

    Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
    My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
    A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
    And see it instantly consumed with fire;
    Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
    Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
    And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
    With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
    And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
    The bastard brains with these my proper hands
    Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
    For thou set'st on thy wife.

ANTIGONUS

    I did not, sir:
    These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
    Can clear me in't.

Lords

    We can: my royal liege,
    He is not guilty of her coming hither.

LEONTES

    You're liars all.

First Lord

    Beseech your highness, give us better credit:
    We have always truly served you, and beseech you
    So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
    As recompense of our dear services
    Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
    Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
    Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.

LEONTES

    I am a feather for each wind that blows:
    Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
    And call me father? better burn it now
    Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
    It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
    You that have been so tenderly officious
    With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
    To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
    So sure as this beard's grey,
    --what will you adventure
    To save this brat's life?

ANTIGONUS

    Any thing, my lord,
    That my ability may undergo
    And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
    I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
    To save the innocent: any thing possible.

LEONTES

    It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
    Thou wilt perform my bidding.

ANTIGONUS

    I will, my lord.

LEONTES

    Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
    Of any point in't shall not only be
    Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
    Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
    As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
    This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
    To some remote and desert place quite out
    Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
    Without more mercy, to its own protection
    And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
    It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
    On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
    That thou commend it strangely to some place
    Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.

ANTIGONUS

    I swear to do this, though a present death
    Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
    Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
    To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
    Casting their savageness aside have done
    Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
    In more than this deed does require! And blessing
    Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
    Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!

    Exit with the child

LEONTES

    No, I'll not rear
    Another's issue.

    Enter a Servant

Servant

    Please your highness, posts
    From those you sent to the oracle are come
    An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,
    Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
    Hasting to the court.

First Lord

    So please you, sir, their speed
    Hath been beyond account.

LEONTES

    Twenty-three days
    They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
    The great Apollo suddenly will have
    The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
    Summon a session, that we may arraign
    Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
    Been publicly accused, so shall she have
    A just and open trial. While she lives
    My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
    And think upon my bidding.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A sea-port in Sicilia.

    Enter CLEOMENES and DION

CLEOMENES

    The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
    Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
    The common praise it bears.

DION

    I shall report,
    For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
    Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
    Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
    How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
    It was i' the offering!

CLEOMENES

    But of all, the burst
    And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
    Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
    That I was nothing.

DION

    If the event o' the journey
    Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--
    As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
    The time is worth the use on't.

CLEOMENES

    Great Apollo
    Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
    So forcing faults upon Hermione,
    I little like.

DION

    The violent carriage of it
    Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
    Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
    Shall the contents discover, something rare
    Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
    And gracious be the issue!

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A court of Justice.

    Enter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers

LEONTES

    This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
    Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
    The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
    Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
    Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
    Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
    Even to the guilt or the purgation.
    Produce the prisoner.

Officer

    It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
    Appear in person here in court. Silence!

    Enter HERMIONE guarded; PAULINA and Ladies attending

LEONTES

    Read the indictment.

Officer

    [Reads] Hermione, queen to the worthy
    Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and
    arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery
    with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring
    with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
    lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence
    whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,
    thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance
    of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for
    their better safety, to fly away by night.

HERMIONE

    Since what I am to say must be but that
    Which contradicts my accusation and
    The testimony on my part no other
    But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
    To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
    Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
    Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
    Behold our human actions, as they do,
    I doubt not then but innocence shall make
    False accusation blush and tyranny
    Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
    Who least will seem to do so, my past life
    Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
    As I am now unhappy; which is more
    Than history can pattern, though devised
    And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
    A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
    A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,
    The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
    To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
    Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
    As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
    'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
    And only that I stand for. I appeal
    To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
    Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
    How merited to be so; since he came,
    With what encounter so uncurrent I
    Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
    The bound of honour, or in act or will
    That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
    Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
    Cry fie upon my grave!

LEONTES

    I ne'er heard yet
    That any of these bolder vices wanted
    Less impudence to gainsay what they did
    Than to perform it first.

HERMIONE

    That's true enough;
    Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.

LEONTES

    You will not own it.

HERMIONE

    More than mistress of
    Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
    At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
    With whom I am accused, I do confess
    I loved him as in honour he required,
    With such a kind of love as might become
    A lady like me, with a love even such,
    So and no other, as yourself commanded:
    Which not to have done I think had been in me
    Both disobedience and ingratitude
    To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
    Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
    That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
    I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
    For me to try how: all I know of it
    Is that Camillo was an honest man;
    And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
    Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.

LEONTES

    You knew of his departure, as you know
    What you have underta'en to do in's absence.

HERMIONE

    Sir,
    You speak a language that I understand not:
    My life stands in the level of your dreams,
    Which I'll lay down.

LEONTES

    Your actions are my dreams;
    You had a bastard by Polixenes,
    And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
    Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
    Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
    Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
    No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
    More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
    Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
    Look for no less than death.

HERMIONE

    Sir, spare your threats:
    The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
    To me can life be no commodity:
    The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
    I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
    But know not how it went. My second joy
    And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
    I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort
    Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
    The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
    Haled out to murder: myself on every post
    Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
    The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
    To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
    Here to this place, i' the open air, before
    I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
    Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
    That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
    But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
    I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
    Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
    Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
    But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
    'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
    I do refer me to the oracle:
    Apollo be my judge!

First Lord

    This your request
    Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
    And in Apollos name, his oracle.

    Exeunt certain Officers

HERMIONE

    The Emperor of Russia was my father:
    O that he were alive, and here beholding
    His daughter's trial! that he did but see
    The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
    Of pity, not revenge!

    Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION

Officer

    You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
    That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
    Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
    The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
    Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
    You have not dared to break the holy seal
    Nor read the secrets in't.

CLEOMENES DION

    All this we swear.

LEONTES

    Break up the seals and read.

Officer

    [Reads] Hermione is chaste;
    Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes
    a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;
    and the king shall live without an heir, if that
    which is lost be not found.

Lords

    Now blessed be the great Apollo!

HERMIONE

    Praised!

LEONTES

    Hast thou read truth?

Officer

    Ay, my lord; even so
    As it is here set down.

LEONTES

    There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
    The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.

    Enter Servant

Servant

    My lord the king, the king!

LEONTES

    What is the business?

Servant

    O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
    The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
    Of the queen's speed, is gone.

LEONTES

    How! gone!

Servant

    Is dead.

LEONTES

    Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
    Do strike at my injustice.

    HERMIONE swoons
    How now there!

PAULINA

    This news is mortal to the queen: look down
    And see what death is doing.

LEONTES

    Take her hence:
    Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
    I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
    Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
    Some remedies for life.

    Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONE
    Apollo, pardon
    My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
    I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
    New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
    Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
    For, being transported by my jealousies
    To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
    Camillo for the minister to poison
    My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
    But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
    My swift command, though I with death and with
    Reward did threaten and encourage him,
    Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
    And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
    Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
    Which you knew great, and to the hazard
    Of all encertainties himself commended,
    No richer than his honour: how he glisters
    Thorough my rust! and how his pity
    Does my deeds make the blacker!

    Re-enter PAULINA

PAULINA

    Woe the while!
    O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
    Break too.

First Lord

    What fit is this, good lady?

PAULINA

    What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
    What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
    In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
    Must I receive, whose every word deserves
    To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
    Together working with thy jealousies,
    Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
    For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
    And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
    Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
    That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
    That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
    And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
    Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
    To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
    More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
    The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
    To be or none or little; though a devil
    Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
    Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
    Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
    Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
    That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
    Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
    Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
    When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
    The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
    and vengeance for't
    Not dropp'd down yet.

First Lord

    The higher powers forbid!

PAULINA

    I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
    Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
    Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
    Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
    As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
    Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
    Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
    To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
    Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
    Upon a barren mountain and still winter
    In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
    To look that way thou wert.

LEONTES

    Go on, go on
    Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
    All tongues to talk their bitterest.

First Lord

    Say no more:
    Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
    I' the boldness of your speech.

PAULINA

    I am sorry for't:
    All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
    I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
    The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
    To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
    Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
    At my petition; I beseech you, rather
    Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
    Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
    Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
    The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
    I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
    I'll not remember you of my own lord,
    Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
    And I'll say nothing.

LEONTES

    Thou didst speak but well
    When most the truth; which I receive much better
    Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
    To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
    One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
    The causes of their death appear, unto
    Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
    The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
    Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
    Will bear up with this exercise, so long
    I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
    Unto these sorrows.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.

    Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner

ANTIGONUS

    Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
    The deserts of Bohemia?

Mariner

    Ay, my lord: and fear
    We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
    And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
    The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
    And frown upon 's.

ANTIGONUS

    Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
    Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
    I call upon thee.

Mariner

    Make your best haste, and go not
    Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;
    Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
    Of prey that keep upon't.

ANTIGONUS

    Go thou away:
    I'll follow instantly.

Mariner

    I am glad at heart
    To be so rid o' the business.

    Exit

ANTIGONUS

    Come, poor babe:
    I have heard, but not believed,
    the spirits o' the dead
    May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
    Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
    So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
    Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
    I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
    So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
    Like very sanctity, she did approach
    My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
    And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
    Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
    Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
    Since fate, against thy better disposition,
    Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
    Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
    Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
    There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
    Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
    I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
    Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
    Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
    She melted into air. Affrighted much,
    I did in time collect myself and thought
    This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
    Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
    I will be squared by this. I do believe
    Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
    Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
    Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
    Either for life or death, upon the earth
    Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
    There lie, and there thy character: there these;
    Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
    And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
    That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
    To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
    But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
    To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
    The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
    A lullaby too rough: I never saw
    The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
    Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
    I am gone for ever.

    Exit, pursued by a bear

    Enter a Shepherd

Shepherd

    I would there were no age between sixteen and
    three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
    rest; for there is nothing in the between but
    getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,
    stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
    these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
    hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
    best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find
    than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by
    the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
    will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
    pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
    pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
    though I am not bookish, yet I can read
    waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
    some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
    behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
    than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
    pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
    but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!

    Enter Clown

Clown

    Hilloa, loa!

Shepherd

    What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk
    on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What
    ailest thou, man?

Clown

    I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
    but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
    sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
    a bodkin's point.

Shepherd

    Why, boy, how is it?

Clown

    I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
    how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
    point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
    sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
    ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
    swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
    cork into a hogshead. And then for the
    land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
    shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
    his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
    end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
    it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
    sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared
    and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
    the sea or weather.

Shepherd

    Name of mercy, when was this, boy?

Clown

    Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
    sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor
    the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
    now.

Shepherd

    Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!

Clown

    I would you had been by the ship side, to have
    helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.

Shepherd

    Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
    boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
    dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for
    thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
    child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;
    open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be
    rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
    open't. What's within, boy?

Clown

    You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
    are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!

Shepherd

    This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
    with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
    We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
    nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
    boy, the next way home.

Clown

    Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
    if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
    he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
    are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
    it.

Shepherd

    That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
    which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
    sight of him.

Clown

    Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.

Shepherd

    'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.

    Exeunt

ACT IV

    SCENE I:

    Enter Time, the Chorus

Time

    I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
    Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
    Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
    To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
    To me or my swift passage, that I slide
    O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
    Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
    To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
    To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
    The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
    Or what is now received: I witness to
    The times that brought them in; so shall I do
    To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
    The glistering of this present, as my tale
    Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
    I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
    As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
    The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
    That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
    Gentle spectators, that I now may be
    In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
    I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
    I now name to you; and with speed so pace
    To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
    Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
    I list not prophecy; but let Time's news
    Be known when 'tis brought forth.
    A shepherd's daughter,
    And what to her adheres, which follows after,
    Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
    If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
    If never, yet that Time himself doth say
    He wishes earnestly you never may.

    Exit

SCENE II. Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.

    Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO

POLIXENES

    I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
    'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
    grant this.

CAMILLO

    It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
    I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
    desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
    king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
    sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
    think so, which is another spur to my departure.

POLIXENES

    As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
    thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
    thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to
    have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
    made me businesses which none without thee can
    sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
    them thyself or take away with thee the very
    services thou hast done; which if I have not enough
    considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
    thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
    therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
    country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very
    naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
    penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
    my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen
    and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
    Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
    son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
    being gracious, than they are in losing them when
    they have approved their virtues.

CAMILLO

    Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
    his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
    have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
    from court and is less frequent to his princely
    exercises than formerly he hath appeared.

POLIXENES

    I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
    care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
    look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
    intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
    most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
    very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
    neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.

CAMILLO

    I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
    daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
    extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.

POLIXENES

    That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I
    fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
    shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not
    appearing what we are, have some question with the
    shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
    uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
    Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and
    lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.

CAMILLO

    I willingly obey your command.

POLIXENES

    My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A road near the Shepherd's cottage.

    Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing

AUTOLYCUS

    When daffodils begin to peer,
    With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
    Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
    For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
    The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
    With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
    Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
    For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
    The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
    With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
    Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
    While we lie tumbling in the hay.
    I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
    wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:
    But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
    The pale moon shines by night:
    And when I wander here and there,
    I then do most go right.
    If tinkers may have leave to live,
    And bear the sow-skin budget,
    Then my account I well may, give,
    And in the stocks avouch it.
    My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
    lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
    being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
    a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
    drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is
    the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
    on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
    me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought
    of it. A prize! a prize!

    Enter Clown

Clown

    Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
    yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
    shorn. what comes the wool to?

AUTOLYCUS

    [Aside]
    If the springe hold, the cock's mine.

Clown

    I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
    I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
    of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
    this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
    hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
    on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
    the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
    ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
    one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
    horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
    pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
    nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I
    may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
    raisins o' the sun.

AUTOLYCUS

    O that ever I was born!

    Grovelling on the ground

Clown

    I' the name of me--

AUTOLYCUS

    O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and
    then, death, death!

Clown

    Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
    on thee, rather than have these off.

AUTOLYCUS

    O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
    than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
    ones and millions.

Clown

    Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
    great matter.

AUTOLYCUS

    I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
    ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
    me.

Clown

    What, by a horseman, or a footman?

AUTOLYCUS

    A footman, sweet sir, a footman.

Clown

    Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
    has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
    it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
    I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.

AUTOLYCUS

    O, good sir, tenderly, O!

Clown

    Alas, poor soul!

AUTOLYCUS

    O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
    shoulder-blade is out.

Clown

    How now! canst stand?

AUTOLYCUS

    [Picking his pocket]
    Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me
    a charitable office.

Clown

    Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.

AUTOLYCUS

    No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
    a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,
    unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or
    any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;
    that kills my heart.

Clown

    What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?

AUTOLYCUS

    A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
    troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
    prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
    virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.

Clown

    His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
    out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
    there; and yet it will no more but abide.

AUTOLYCUS

    Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
    hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
    process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
    motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
    wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
    and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
    settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.

Clown

    Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
    wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.

AUTOLYCUS

    Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
    put me into this apparel.

Clown

    Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
    but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.

AUTOLYCUS

    I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
    false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
    him.

Clown

    How do you now?

AUTOLYCUS

    Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and
    walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace
    softly towards my kinsman's.

Clown

    Shall I bring thee on the way?

AUTOLYCUS

    No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.

Clown

    Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
    sheep-shearing.

AUTOLYCUS

    Prosper you, sweet sir!

    Exit Clown
    Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
    I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
    make not this cheat bring out another and the
    shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
    put in the book of virtue!

    Sings
    Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
    And merrily hent the stile-a:
    A merry heart goes all the day,
    Your sad tires in a mile-a.

    Exit

SCENE IV. The Shepherd's cottage.

    Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA

FLORIZEL

    These your unusual weeds to each part of you
    Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
    Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
    Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
    And you the queen on't.

PERDITA

    Sir, my gracious lord,
    To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
    O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
    The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
    With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
    Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
    In every mess have folly and the feeders
    Digest it with a custom, I should blush
    To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
    To show myself a glass.

FLORIZEL

    I bless the time
    When my good falcon made her flight across
    Thy father's ground.

PERDITA

    Now Jove afford you cause!
    To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
    Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
    To think your father, by some accident,
    Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
    How would he look, to see his work so noble
    Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
    Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
    The sternness of his presence?

FLORIZEL

    Apprehend
    Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
    Humbling their deities to love, have taken
    The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
    Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
    A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
    Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
    As I seem now. Their transformations
    Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
    Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
    Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
    Burn hotter than my faith.

PERDITA

    O, but, sir,
    Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
    Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
    One of these two must be necessities,
    Which then will speak, that you must
    change this purpose,
    Or I my life.

FLORIZEL

    Thou dearest Perdita,
    With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
    The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
    Or not my father's. For I cannot be
    Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
    I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
    Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
    Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
    That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
    Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
    Of celebration of that nuptial which
    We two have sworn shall come.

PERDITA

    O lady Fortune,
    Stand you auspicious!

FLORIZEL

    See, your guests approach:
    Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
    And let's be red with mirth.

    Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised

Shepherd

    Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
    This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
    Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
    Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
    At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
    On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
    With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
    She would to each one sip. You are retired,
    As if you were a feasted one and not
    The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
    These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
    A way to make us better friends, more known.
    Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
    That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
    And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
    As your good flock shall prosper.

PERDITA

    [To POLIXENES] Sir, welcome:
    It is my father's will I should take on me
    The hostess-ship o' the day.

    To CAMILLO
    You're welcome, sir.
    Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
    For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
    Seeming and savour all the winter long:
    Grace and remembrance be to you both,
    And welcome to our shearing!

POLIXENES

    Shepherdess,
    A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
    With flowers of winter.

PERDITA

    Sir, the year growing ancient,
    Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
    Of trembling winter, the fairest
    flowers o' the season
    Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
    Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
    Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
    To get slips of them.

POLIXENES

    Wherefore, gentle maiden,
    Do you neglect them?

PERDITA

    For I have heard it said
    There is an art which in their piedness shares
    With great creating nature.

POLIXENES

    Say there be;
    Yet nature is made better by no mean
    But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
    Which you say adds to nature, is an art
    That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
    A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
    And make conceive a bark of baser kind
    By bud of nobler race: this is an art
    Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
    The art itself is nature.

PERDITA

    So it is.

POLIXENES

    Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
    And do not call them bastards.

PERDITA

    I'll not put
    The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
    No more than were I painted I would wish
    This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
    Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
    Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
    The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
    And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
    Of middle summer, and I think they are given
    To men of middle age. You're very welcome.

CAMILLO

    I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
    And only live by gazing.

PERDITA

    Out, alas!
    You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
    Would blow you through and through.
    Now, my fair'st friend,
    I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
    Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
    That wear upon your virgin branches yet
    Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
    For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
    From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
    That come before the swallow dares, and take
    The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
    But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
    Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
    That die unmarried, ere they can behold
    Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
    Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
    The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
    The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
    To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
    To strew him o'er and o'er!

FLORIZEL

    What, like a corse?

PERDITA

    No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
    Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
    But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
    Methinks I play as I have seen them do
    In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
    Does change my disposition.

FLORIZEL

    What you do
    Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
    I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
    I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
    Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
    To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
    A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
    Nothing but that; move still, still so,
    And own no other function: each your doing,
    So singular in each particular,
    Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
    That all your acts are queens.

PERDITA

    O Doricles,
    Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
    And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
    Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
    With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
    You woo'd me the false way.

FLORIZEL

    I think you have
    As little skill to fear as I have purpose
    To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
    Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
    That never mean to part.

PERDITA

    I'll swear for 'em.

POLIXENES

    This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
    Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
    But smacks of something greater than herself,
    Too noble for this place.

CAMILLO

    He tells her something
    That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
    The queen of curds and cream.

Clown

    Come on, strike up!

DORCAS

    Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
    To mend her kissing with!

MOPSA

    Now, in good time!

Clown

    Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
    Come, strike up!

    Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and Shepherdesses

POLIXENES

    Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
    Which dances with your daughter?

Shepherd

    They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
    To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
    Upon his own report and I believe it;
    He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
    I think so too; for never gazed the moon
    Upon the water as he'll stand and read
    As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
    I think there is not half a kiss to choose
    Who loves another best.

POLIXENES

    She dances featly.

Shepherd

    So she does any thing; though I report it,
    That should be silent: if young Doricles
    Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
    Which he not dreams of.

    Enter Servant

Servant

    O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
    door, you would never dance again after a tabour and
    pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
    several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he
    utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
    ears grew to his tunes.

Clown

    He could never come better; he shall come in. I
    love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
    matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
    indeed and sung lamentably.

Servant

    He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
    milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
    has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
    bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate
    burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
    her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
    as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
    the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
    no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
    'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'

POLIXENES

    This is a brave fellow.

Clown

    Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
    fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?

Servant

    He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;
    points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
    learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
    gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
    sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
    would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
    to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.

Clown

    Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.

PERDITA

    Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.

    Exit Servant

Clown

    You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
    than you'ld think, sister.

PERDITA

    Ay, good brother, or go about to think.

    Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing

AUTOLYCUS

    Lawn as white as driven snow;
    Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
    Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
    Masks for faces and for noses;
    Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
    Perfume for a lady's chamber;
    Golden quoifs and stomachers,
    For my lads to give their dears:
    Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
    What maids lack from head to heel:
    Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
    Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.

Clown

    If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
    no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
    will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.

MOPSA

    I was promised them against the feast; but they come
    not too late now.

DORCAS

    He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.

MOPSA

    He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
    paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.

Clown

    Is there no manners left among maids? will they
    wear their plackets where they should bear their
    faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
    going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
    secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
    our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
    your tongues, and not a word more.

MOPSA

    I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
    and a pair of sweet gloves.

Clown

    Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
    and lost all my money?

AUTOLYCUS

    And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
    therefore it behoves men to be wary.

Clown

    Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.

AUTOLYCUS

    I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.

Clown

    What hast here? ballads?

MOPSA

    Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
    life, for then we are sure they are true.

AUTOLYCUS

    Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
    wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
    burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
    toads carbonadoed.

MOPSA

    Is it true, think you?

AUTOLYCUS

    Very true, and but a month old.

DORCAS

    Bless me from marrying a usurer!

AUTOLYCUS

    Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
    Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
    present. Why should I carry lies abroad?

MOPSA

    Pray you now, buy it.

Clown

    Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
    ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.

AUTOLYCUS

    Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
    the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
    forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
    ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
    thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
    fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
    loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.

DORCAS

    Is it true too, think you?

AUTOLYCUS

    Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
    my pack will hold.

Clown

    Lay it by too: another.

AUTOLYCUS

    This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.

MOPSA

    Let's have some merry ones.

AUTOLYCUS

    Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
    the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
    scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
    request, I can tell you.

MOPSA

    We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
    shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.

DORCAS

    We had the tune on't a month ago.

AUTOLYCUS

    I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
    occupation; have at it with you.

    SONG

AUTOLYCUS

    Get you hence, for I must go
    Where it fits not you to know.

DORCAS

    Whither?

MOPSA

    O, whither?

DORCAS

    Whither?

MOPSA

    It becomes thy oath full well,
    Thou to me thy secrets tell.

DORCAS

    Me too, let me go thither.

MOPSA

    Or thou goest to the orange or mill.

DORCAS

    If to either, thou dost ill.

AUTOLYCUS

    Neither.

DORCAS

    What, neither?

AUTOLYCUS

    Neither.

DORCAS

    Thou hast sworn my love to be.

MOPSA

    Thou hast sworn it more to me:
    Then whither goest? say, whither?

Clown

    We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
    father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
    not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
    me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's
    have the first choice. Follow me, girls.

    Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA

AUTOLYCUS

    And you shall pay well for 'em.

    Follows singing
    Will you buy any tape,
    Or lace for your cape,
    My dainty duck, my dear-a?
    Any silk, any thread,
    Any toys for your head,
    Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
    Come to the pedlar;
    Money's a medler.
    That doth utter all men's ware-a.

    Exit

    Re-enter Servant

Servant

    Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
    three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made
    themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
    Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
    say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
    not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it
    be not too rough for some that know little but
    bowling, it will please plentifully.

Shepherd

    Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
    homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.

POLIXENES

    You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
    these four threes of herdsmen.

Servant

    One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath
    danced before the king; and not the worst of the
    three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.

Shepherd

    Leave your prating: since these good men are
    pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.

Servant

    Why, they stay at door, sir.

    Exit

    Here a dance of twelve Satyrs

POLIXENES

    O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.

    To CAMILLO
    Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
    He's simple and tells much.

    To FLORIZEL
    How now, fair shepherd!
    Your heart is full of something that does take
    Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
    And handed love as you do, I was wont
    To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
    The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
    To her acceptance; you have let him go
    And nothing marted with him. If your lass
    Interpretation should abuse and call this
    Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
    For a reply, at least if you make a care
    Of happy holding her.

FLORIZEL

    Old sir, I know
    She prizes not such trifles as these are:
    The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
    Up in my heart; which I have given already,
    But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
    Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
    Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
    As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
    Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
    snow that's bolted
    By the northern blasts twice o'er.

POLIXENES

    What follows this?
    How prettily the young swain seems to wash
    The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
    But to your protestation; let me hear
    What you profess.

FLORIZEL

    Do, and be witness to 't.

POLIXENES

    And this my neighbour too?

FLORIZEL

    And he, and more
    Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
    That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
    Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
    That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
    More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
    Without her love; for her employ them all;
    Commend them and condemn them to her service
    Or to their own perdition.

POLIXENES

    Fairly offer'd.

CAMILLO

    This shows a sound affection.

Shepherd

    But, my daughter,
    Say you the like to him?

PERDITA

    I cannot speak
    So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
    By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
    The purity of his.

Shepherd

    Take hands, a bargain!
    And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
    I give my daughter to him, and will make
    Her portion equal his.

FLORIZEL

    O, that must be
    I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
    I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
    Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
    Contract us 'fore these witnesses.

Shepherd

    Come, your hand;
    And, daughter, yours.

POLIXENES

    Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
    Have you a father?

FLORIZEL

    I have: but what of him?

POLIXENES

    Knows he of this?

FLORIZEL

    He neither does nor shall.

POLIXENES

    Methinks a father
    Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
    That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
    Is not your father grown incapable
    Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
    With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
    Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
    Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
    But what he did being childish?

FLORIZEL

    No, good sir;
    He has his health and ampler strength indeed
    Than most have of his age.

POLIXENES

    By my white beard,
    You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
    Something unfilial: reason my son
    Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
    The father, all whose joy is nothing else
    But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
    In such a business.

FLORIZEL

    I yield all this;
    But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
    Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
    My father of this business.

POLIXENES

    Let him know't.

FLORIZEL

    He shall not.

POLIXENES

    Prithee, let him.

FLORIZEL

    No, he must not.

Shepherd

    Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
    At knowing of thy choice.

FLORIZEL

    Come, come, he must not.
    Mark our contract.

POLIXENES

    Mark your divorce, young sir,

    Discovering himself
    Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
    To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
    That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
    I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
    But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
    Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
    The royal fool thou copest with,--

Shepherd

    O, my heart!

POLIXENES

    I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
    More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
    If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
    That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
    I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
    Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
    Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
    Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
    Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
    From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
    Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
    That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
    Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
    These rural latches to his entrance open,
    Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
    I will devise a death as cruel for thee
    As thou art tender to't.

    Exit

PERDITA

    Even here undone!
    I was not much afeard; for once or twice
    I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
    The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
    Hides not his visage from our cottage but
    Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?
    I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
    Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
    Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
    But milk my ewes and weep.

CAMILLO

    Why, how now, father!
    Speak ere thou diest.

Shepherd

    I cannot speak, nor think
    Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
    You have undone a man of fourscore three,
    That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
    To die upon the bed my father died,
    To lie close by his honest bones: but now
    Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
    Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
    That knew'st this was the prince,
    and wouldst adventure
    To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
    If I might die within this hour, I have lived
    To die when I desire.

    Exit

FLORIZEL

    Why look you so upon me?
    I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
    But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
    More straining on for plucking back, not following
    My leash unwillingly.

CAMILLO

    Gracious my lord,
    You know your father's temper: at this time
    He will allow no speech, which I do guess
    You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
    Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
    Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
    Come not before him.

FLORIZEL

    I not purpose it.
    I think, Camillo?

CAMILLO

    Even he, my lord.

PERDITA

    How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
    How often said, my dignity would last
    But till 'twere known!

FLORIZEL

    It cannot fail but by
    The violation of my faith; and then
    Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
    And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
    From my succession wipe me, father; I
    Am heir to my affection.

CAMILLO

    Be advised.

FLORIZEL

    I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
    Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
    If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
    Do bid it welcome.

CAMILLO

    This is desperate, sir.

FLORIZEL

    So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
    I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
    Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
    Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
    The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
    In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
    To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
    As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
    When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
    To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
    Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
    Tug for the time to come. This you may know
    And so deliver, I am put to sea
    With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
    And most opportune to our need I have
    A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
    For this design. What course I mean to hold
    Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
    Concern me the reporting.

CAMILLO

    O my lord!
    I would your spirit were easier for advice,
    Or stronger for your need.

FLORIZEL

    Hark, Perdita

    Drawing her aside
    I'll hear you by and by.

CAMILLO

    He's irremoveable,
    Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
    His going I could frame to serve my turn,
    Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
    Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
    And that unhappy king, my master, whom
    I so much thirst to see.

FLORIZEL

    Now, good Camillo;
    I am so fraught with curious business that
    I leave out ceremony.

CAMILLO

    Sir, I think
    You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
    That I have borne your father?

FLORIZEL

    Very nobly
    Have you deserved: it is my father's music
    To speak your deeds, not little of his care
    To have them recompensed as thought on.

CAMILLO

    Well, my lord,
    If you may please to think I love the king
    And through him what is nearest to him, which is
    Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
    If your more ponderous and settled project
    May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
    I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
    As shall become your highness; where you may
    Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
    There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
    As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
    And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
    Your discontenting father strive to qualify
    And bring him up to liking.

FLORIZEL

    How, Camillo,
    May this, almost a miracle, be done?
    That I may call thee something more than man
    And after that trust to thee.

CAMILLO

    Have you thought on
    A place whereto you'll go?

FLORIZEL

    Not any yet:
    But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
    To what we wildly do, so we profess
    Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
    Of every wind that blows.

CAMILLO

    Then list to me:
    This follows, if you will not change your purpose
    But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
    And there present yourself and your fair princess,
    For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
    She shall be habited as it becomes
    The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
    Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
    His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
    As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
    Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
    'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
    He chides to hell and bids the other grow
    Faster than thought or time.

FLORIZEL

    Worthy Camillo,
    What colour for my visitation shall I
    Hold up before him?

CAMILLO

    Sent by the king your father
    To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
    The manner of your bearing towards him, with
    What you as from your father shall deliver,
    Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
    The which shall point you forth at every sitting
    What you must say; that he shall not perceive
    But that you have your father's bosom there
    And speak his very heart.

FLORIZEL

    I am bound to you:
    There is some sap in this.

CAMILLO

    A cause more promising
    Than a wild dedication of yourselves
    To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
    To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
    But as you shake off one to take another;
    Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
    Do their best office, if they can but stay you
    Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
    Prosperity's the very bond of love,
    Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
    Affliction alters.

PERDITA

    One of these is true:
    I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
    But not take in the mind.

CAMILLO

    Yea, say you so?
    There shall not at your father's house these
    seven years
    Be born another such.

FLORIZEL

    My good Camillo,
    She is as forward of her breeding as
    She is i' the rear our birth.

CAMILLO

    I cannot say 'tis pity
    She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
    To most that teach.

PERDITA

    Your pardon, sir; for this
    I'll blush you thanks.

FLORIZEL

    My prettiest Perdita!
    But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
    Preserver of my father, now of me,
    The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
    We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
    Nor shall appear in Sicilia.

CAMILLO

    My lord,
    Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
    Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
    To have you royally appointed as if
    The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
    That you may know you shall not want, one word.

    They talk aside

    Re-enter AUTOLYCUS

AUTOLYCUS

    Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
    sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
    all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
    ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
    knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
    to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
    should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
    hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
    by which means I saw whose purse was best in
    picture; and what I saw, to my good use I
    remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
    be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
    wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
    till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
    rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
    stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
    was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
    purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
    chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
    and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
    time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
    festival purses; and had not the old man come in
    with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
    son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
    left a purse alive in the whole army.

    CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward

CAMILLO

    Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
    So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.

FLORIZEL

    And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--

CAMILLO

    Shall satisfy your father.

PERDITA

    Happy be you!
    All that you speak shows fair.

CAMILLO

    Who have we here?

    Seeing AUTOLYCUS
    We'll make an instrument of this, omit
    Nothing may give us aid.

AUTOLYCUS

    If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.

CAMILLO

    How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
    not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.

AUTOLYCUS

    I am a poor fellow, sir.

CAMILLO

    Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
    thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
    make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,
    --thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and
    change garments with this gentleman: though the
    pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,
    there's some boot.

AUTOLYCUS

    I am a poor fellow, sir.

    Aside
    I know ye well enough.

CAMILLO

    Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
    flayed already.

AUTOLYCUS

    Are you in earnest, sir?

    Aside
    I smell the trick on't.

FLORIZEL

    Dispatch, I prithee.

AUTOLYCUS

    Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
    conscience take it.

CAMILLO

    Unbuckle, unbuckle.

    FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments
    Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
    Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
    Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
    And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
    Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
    The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
    For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
    Get undescried.

PERDITA

    I see the play so lies
    That I must bear a part.

CAMILLO

    No remedy.
    Have you done there?

FLORIZEL

    Should I now meet my father,
    He would not call me son.

CAMILLO

    Nay, you shall have no hat.

    Giving it to PERDITA
    Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.

AUTOLYCUS

    Adieu, sir.

FLORIZEL

    O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
    Pray you, a word.

CAMILLO

    [Aside] What I do next, shall be to tell the king
    Of this escape and whither they are bound;
    Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
    To force him after: in whose company
    I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight
    I have a woman's longing.

FLORIZEL

    Fortune speed us!
    Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.

CAMILLO

    The swifter speed the better.

    Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO

AUTOLYCUS

    I understand the business, I hear it: to have an
    open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
    necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
    also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
    this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
    What an exchange had this been without boot! What
    a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
    this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
    extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
    iniquity, stealing away from his father with his
    clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
    honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
    do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
    and therein am I constant to my profession.

    Re-enter Clown and Shepherd
    Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:
    every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
    hanging, yields a careful man work.

Clown

    See, see; what a man you are now!
    There is no other way but to tell the king
    she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.

Shepherd

    Nay, but hear me.

Clown

    Nay, but hear me.

Shepherd

    Go to, then.

Clown

    She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
    and blood has not offended the king; and so your
    flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
    those things you found about her, those secret
    things, all but what she has with her: this being
    done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.

Shepherd

    I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his
    son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,
    neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make
    me the king's brother-in-law.

Clown

    Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
    could have been to him and then your blood had been
    the dearer by I know how much an ounce.

AUTOLYCUS

    [Aside] Very wisely, puppies!

Shepherd

    Well, let us to the king: there is that in this
    fardel will make him scratch his beard.

AUTOLYCUS

    [Aside] I know not what impediment this complaint
    may be to the flight of my master.

Clown

    Pray heartily he be at palace.

AUTOLYCUS

    [Aside] Though I am not naturally honest, I am so
    sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.

    Takes off his false beard
    How now, rustics! whither are you bound?

Shepherd

    To the palace, an it like your worship.

AUTOLYCUS

    Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
    of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
    names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
    thing that is fitting to be known, discover.

Clown

    We are but plain fellows, sir.

AUTOLYCUS

    A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
    lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
    often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
    it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
    they do not give us the lie.

Clown

    Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
    had not taken yourself with the manner.

Shepherd

    Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS

    Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
    thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
    hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
    receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
    not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
    for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
    business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
    cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
    back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
    open thy affair.

Shepherd

    My business, sir, is to the king.

AUTOLYCUS

    What advocate hast thou to him?

Shepherd

    I know not, an't like you.

Clown

    Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
    have none.

Shepherd

    None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.

AUTOLYCUS

    How blessed are we that are not simple men!
    Yet nature might have made me as these are,
    Therefore I will not disdain.

Clown

    This cannot be but a great courtier.

Shepherd

    His garments are rich, but he wears
    them not handsomely.

Clown

    He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
    a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking
    on's teeth.

AUTOLYCUS

    The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
    Wherefore that box?

Shepherd

    Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
    which none must know but the king; and which he
    shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
    speech of him.

AUTOLYCUS

    Age, thou hast lost thy labour.

Shepherd

    Why, sir?

AUTOLYCUS

    The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
    new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
    if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
    know the king is full of grief.

Shepard

    So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have
    married a shepherd's daughter.

AUTOLYCUS

    If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
    the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
    feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.

Clown

    Think you so, sir?

AUTOLYCUS

    Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
    and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
    him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
    under the hangman: which though it be great pity,
    yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
    ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
    grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
    is too soft for him, say I draw our throne into a
    sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.

Clown

    Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
    like you, sir?

AUTOLYCUS

    He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
    'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
    wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters
    and a dram dead; then recovered again with
    aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as
    he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
    proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
    sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
    is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
    talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
    are to be smiled at, their offences being so
    capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
    men, what you have to the king: being something
    gently considered, I'll bring you where he is
    aboard, tender your persons to his presence,
    whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
    besides the king to effect your suits, here is man
    shall do it.

Clown

    He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
    give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn
    bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
    the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
    and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'

Shepherd

    An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for
    us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much
    more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.

AUTOLYCUS

    After I have done what I promised?

Shepherd

    Ay, sir.

AUTOLYCUS

    Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?

Clown

    In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful
    one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.

AUTOLYCUS

    O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
    he'll be made an example.

Clown

    Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
    our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
    daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
    will give you as much as this old man does when the
    business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
    pawn till it be brought you.

AUTOLYCUS

    I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
    go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
    hedge and follow you.

Clown

    We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.

Shepherd

    Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.

    Exeunt Shepherd and Clown

AUTOLYCUS

    If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
    not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
    courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
    to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
    that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
    these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
    think it fit to shore them again and that the
    complaint they have to the king concerns him
    nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
    officious; for I am proof against that title and
    what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
    them: there may be matter in it.

    Exit

ACT V
SCENE I. A room in LEONTES' palace.

    Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants

CLEOMENES

    Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
    A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
    Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
    More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
    Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
    With them forgive yourself.

LEONTES

    Whilst I remember
    Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
    My blemishes in them, and so still think of
    The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
    That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
    Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
    Bred his hopes out of.

PAULINA

    True, too true, my lord:
    If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
    Or from the all that are took something good,
    To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
    Would be unparallel'd.

LEONTES

    I think so. Kill'd!
    She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
    Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
    Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
    Say so but seldom.

CLEOMENES

    Not at all, good lady:
    You might have spoken a thousand things that would
    Have done the time more benefit and graced
    Your kindness better.

PAULINA

    You are one of those
    Would have him wed again.

DION

    If you would not so,
    You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
    Of his most sovereign name; consider little
    What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
    May drop upon his kingdom and devour
    Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
    Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
    What holier than, for royalty's repair,
    For present comfort and for future good,
    To bless the bed of majesty again
    With a sweet fellow to't?

PAULINA

    There is none worthy,
    Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
    Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
    For has not the divine Apollo said,
    Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
    That King Leontes shall not have an heir
    Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
    Is all as monstrous to our human reason
    As my Antigonus to break his grave
    And come again to me; who, on my life,
    Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
    My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
    Oppose against their wills.

    To LEONTES
    Care not for issue;
    The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
    Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
    Was like to be the best.

LEONTES

    Good Paulina,
    Who hast the memory of Hermione,
    I know, in honour, O, that ever I
    Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
    I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
    Have taken treasure from her lips--

PAULINA

    And left them
    More rich for what they yielded.

LEONTES

    Thou speak'st truth.
    No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
    And better used, would make her sainted spirit
    Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
    Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
    And begin, 'Why to me?'

PAULINA

    Had she such power,
    She had just cause.

LEONTES

    She had; and would incense me
    To murder her I married.

PAULINA

    I should so.
    Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
    Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
    You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
    Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
    Should be 'Remember mine.'

LEONTES

    Stars, stars,
    And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
    I'll have no wife, Paulina.

PAULINA

    Will you swear
    Never to marry but by my free leave?

LEONTES

    Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!

PAULINA

    Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.

CLEOMENES

    You tempt him over-much.

PAULINA

    Unless another,
    As like Hermione as is her picture,
    Affront his eye.

CLEOMENES

    Good madam,--

PAULINA

    I have done.
    Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
    No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
    To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
    As was your former; but she shall be such
    As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
    it should take joy
    To see her in your arms.

LEONTES

    My true Paulina,
    We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.

PAULINA

    That
    Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
    Never till then.

    Enter a Gentleman

Gentleman

    One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
    Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
    The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
    To your high presence.

LEONTES

    What with him? he comes not
    Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
    So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
    'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
    By need and accident. What train?

Gentleman

    But few,
    And those but mean.

LEONTES

    His princess, say you, with him?

Gentleman

    Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
    That e'er the sun shone bright on.

PAULINA

    O Hermione,
    As every present time doth boast itself
    Above a better gone, so must thy grave
    Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
    Have said and writ so, but your writing now
    Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
    Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
    Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
    To say you have seen a better.

Gentleman

    Pardon, madam:
    The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
    The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
    Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
    Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
    Of all professors else, make proselytes
    Of who she but bid follow.

PAULINA

    How! not women?

Gentleman

    Women will love her, that she is a woman
    More worth than any man; men, that she is
    The rarest of all women.

LEONTES

    Go, Cleomenes;
    Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
    Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange

    Exeunt CLEOMENES and others
    He thus should steal upon us.

PAULINA

    Had our prince,
    Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
    Well with this lord: there was not full a month
    Between their births.

LEONTES

    Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
    He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
    When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
    Will bring me to consider that which may
    Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.

    Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA
    Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
    For she did print your royal father off,
    Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
    Your father's image is so hit in you,
    His very air, that I should call you brother,
    As I did him, and speak of something wildly
    By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
    And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
    I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
    Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
    You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
    All mine own folly--the society,
    Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
    Though bearing misery, I desire my life
    Once more to look on him.

FLORIZEL

    By his command
    Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
    Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
    Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
    Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
    His wish'd ability, he had himself
    The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
    Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
    He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
    And those that bear them living.

LEONTES

    O my brother,
    Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
    Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
    So rarely kind, are as interpreters
    Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
    As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
    Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
    At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
    To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
    The adventure of her person?

FLORIZEL

    Good my lord,
    She came from Libya.

LEONTES

    Where the warlike Smalus,
    That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?

FLORIZEL

    Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
    His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
    A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
    To execute the charge my father gave me
    For visiting your highness: my best train
    I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
    Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
    Not only my success in Libya, sir,
    But my arrival and my wife's in safety
    Here where we are.

LEONTES

    The blessed gods
    Purge all infection from our air whilst you
    Do climate here! You have a holy father,
    A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
    So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
    For which the heavens, taking angry note,
    Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
    As he from heaven merits it, with you
    Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
    Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
    Such goodly things as you!

    Enter a Lord

Lord

    Most noble sir,
    That which I shall report will bear no credit,
    Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
    Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
    Desires you to attach his son, who has--
    His dignity and duty both cast off--
    Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
    A shepherd's daughter.

LEONTES

    Where's Bohemia? speak.

Lord

    Here in your city; I now came from him:
    I speak amazedly; and it becomes
    My marvel and my message. To your court
    Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
    Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
    The father of this seeming lady and
    Her brother, having both their country quitted
    With this young prince.

FLORIZEL

    Camillo has betray'd me;
    Whose honour and whose honesty till now
    Endured all weathers.

Lord

    Lay't so to his charge:
    He's with the king your father.

LEONTES

    Who? Camillo?

Lord

    Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
    Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
    Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
    Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
    Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
    With divers deaths in death.

PERDITA

    O my poor father!
    The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
    Our contract celebrated.

LEONTES

    You are married?

FLORIZEL

    We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
    The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
    The odds for high and low's alike.

LEONTES

    My lord,
    Is this the daughter of a king?

FLORIZEL

    She is,
    When once she is my wife.

LEONTES

    That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
    Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
    Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
    Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
    Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
    That you might well enjoy her.

FLORIZEL

    Dear, look up:
    Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
    Should chase us with my father, power no jot
    Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
    Remember since you owed no more to time
    Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
    Step forth mine advocate; at your request
    My father will grant precious things as trifles.

LEONTES

    Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
    Which he counts but a trifle.

PAULINA

    Sir, my liege,
    Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
    'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
    Than what you look on now.

LEONTES

    I thought of her,
    Even in these looks I made.

    To FLORIZEL
    But your petition
    Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
    Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
    I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
    I now go toward him; therefore follow me
    And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.

    Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman

AUTOLYCUS

    Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?

First Gentleman

    I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
    shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
    whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
    commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
    heard the shepherd say, he found the child.

AUTOLYCUS

    I would most gladly know the issue of it.

First Gentleman

    I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
    changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
    very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
    staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
    eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
    in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
    of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
    passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
    beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
    say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
    extremity of the one, it must needs be.

    Enter another Gentleman
    Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
    The news, Rogero?

Second Gentleman

    Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
    king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
    broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
    cannot be able to express it.

    Enter a third Gentleman
    Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
    deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
    which is called true is so like an old tale, that
    the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
    found his heir?

Third Gentleman

    Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
    circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
    see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
    of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
    the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
    know to be his character, the majesty of the
    creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
    of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
    and many other evidences proclaim her with all
    certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
    the meeting of the two kings?

Second Gentleman

    No.

Third Gentleman

    Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
    cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
    joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
    seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
    joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
    holding up of hands, with countenances of such
    distraction that they were to be known by garment,
    not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
    himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
    joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,
    thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
    embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
    daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
    shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
    conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
    another encounter, which lames report to follow it
    and undoes description to do it.

Second Gentleman

    What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
    hence the child?

Third Gentleman

    Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
    rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
    open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
    avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
    innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
    handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.

First Gentleman

    What became of his bark and his followers?

Third Gentleman

    Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
    in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
    instruments which aided to expose the child were
    even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
    combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
    Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
    her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
    fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
    and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
    her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
    of losing.

First Gentleman

    The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
    kings and princes; for by such was it acted.

Third Gentleman

    One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
    angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
    the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's
    death, with the manner how she came to't bravely
    confessed and lamented by the king, how
    attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one
    sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
    I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
    heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
    colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
    could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.

First Gentleman

    Are they returned to the court?

Third Gentleman

    No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
    which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
    years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
    Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
    eternity and could put breath into his work, would
    beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
    ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
    they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
    answer: thither with all greediness of affection
    are they gone, and there they intend to sup.

Second Gentleman

    I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
    for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
    since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
    house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
    the rejoicing?

First Gentleman

    Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
    every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
    our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
    Let's along.

    Exeunt Gentlemen

AUTOLYCUS

    Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
    would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
    man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
    them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
    at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
    so he then took her to be, who began to be much
    sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
    weather continuing, this mystery remained
    undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
    been the finder out of this secret, it would not
    have relished among my other discredits.

    Enter Shepherd and Clown
    Here come those I have done good to against my will,
    and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.

Shepherd

    Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and
    daughters will be all gentlemen born.

Clown

    You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
    this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
    See you these clothes? say you see them not and
    think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
    these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
    lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.

AUTOLYCUS

    I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.

Clown

    Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.

Shepherd

    And so have I, boy.

Clown

    So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
    father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
    called me brother; and then the two kings called my
    father brother; and then the prince my brother and
    the princess my sister called my father father; and
    so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
    tears that ever we shed.

Shepherd

    We may live, son, to shed many more.

Clown

    Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
    preposterous estate as we are.

AUTOLYCUS

    I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
    faults I have committed to your worship and to give
    me your good report to the prince my master.

Shepherd

    Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are
    gentlemen.

Clown

    Thou wilt amend thy life?

AUTOLYCUS

    Ay, an it like your good worship.

Clown

    Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
    art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.

Shepherd

    You may say it, but not swear it.

Clown

    Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
    franklins say it, I'll swear it.

Shepherd

    How if it be false, son?

Clown

    If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
    it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
    the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
    that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
    tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
    drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
    be a tall fellow of thy hands.

AUTOLYCUS

    I will prove so, sir, to my power.

Clown

    Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
    wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
    being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
    and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
    queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
    good masters.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A chapel in PAULINA'S house.

    Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA, CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants

LEONTES

    O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
    That I have had of thee!

PAULINA

    What, sovereign sir,
    I did not well I meant well. All my services
    You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
    With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
    Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
    It is a surplus of your grace, which never
    My life may last to answer.

LEONTES

    O Paulina,
    We honour you with trouble: but we came
    To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
    Have we pass'd through, not without much content
    In many singularities; but we saw not
    That which my daughter came to look upon,
    The statue of her mother.

PAULINA

    As she lived peerless,
    So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
    Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
    Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
    Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
    To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
    Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.

    PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE standing like a statue
    I like your silence, it the more shows off
    Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
    Comes it not something near?

LEONTES

    Her natural posture!
    Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
    Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
    In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
    As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
    Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
    So aged as this seems.

POLIXENES

    O, not by much.

PAULINA

    So much the more our carver's excellence;
    Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
    As she lived now.

LEONTES

    As now she might have done,
    So much to my good comfort, as it is
    Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
    Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
    As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
    I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
    For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
    There's magic in thy majesty, which has
    My evils conjured to remembrance and
    From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
    Standing like stone with thee.

PERDITA

    And give me leave,
    And do not say 'tis superstition, that
    I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
    Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
    Give me that hand of yours to kiss.

PAULINA

    O, patience!
    The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.

CAMILLO

    My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
    Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
    So many summers dry; scarce any joy
    Did ever so long live; no sorrow
    But kill'd itself much sooner.

POLIXENES

    Dear my brother,
    Let him that was the cause of this have power
    To take off so much grief from you as he
    Will piece up in himself.

PAULINA

    Indeed, my lord,
    If I had thought the sight of my poor image
    Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
    I'ld not have show'd it.

LEONTES

    Do not draw the curtain.

PAULINA

    No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
    May think anon it moves.

LEONTES

    Let be, let be.
    Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
    What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
    Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
    Did verily bear blood?

POLIXENES

    Masterly done:
    The very life seems warm upon her lip.

LEONTES

    The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
    As we are mock'd with art.

PAULINA

    I'll draw the curtain:
    My lord's almost so far transported that
    He'll think anon it lives.

LEONTES

    O sweet Paulina,
    Make me to think so twenty years together!
    No settled senses of the world can match
    The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.

PAULINA

    I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
    I could afflict you farther.

LEONTES

    Do, Paulina;
    For this affliction has a taste as sweet
    As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
    There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
    Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
    For I will kiss her.

PAULINA

    Good my lord, forbear:
    The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
    You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
    With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?

LEONTES

    No, not these twenty years.

PERDITA

    So long could I
    Stand by, a looker on.

PAULINA

    Either forbear,
    Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
    For more amazement. If you can behold it,
    I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
    And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
    Which I protest against--I am assisted
    By wicked powers.

LEONTES

    What you can make her do,
    I am content to look on: what to speak,
    I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
    To make her speak as move.

PAULINA

    It is required
    You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
    On: those that think it is unlawful business
    I am about, let them depart.

LEONTES

    Proceed:
    No foot shall stir.

PAULINA

    Music, awake her; strike!

    Music
    'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
    Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
    I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
    Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
    Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:

    HERMIONE comes down
    Start not; her actions shall be holy as
    You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
    Until you see her die again; for then
    You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
    When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
    Is she become the suitor?

LEONTES

    O, she's warm!
    If this be magic, let it be an art
    Lawful as eating.

POLIXENES

    She embraces him.

CAMILLO

    She hangs about his neck:
    If she pertain to life let her speak too.

POLIXENES

    Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
    Or how stolen from the dead.

PAULINA

    That she is living,
    Were it but told you, should be hooted at
    Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
    Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
    Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
    And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
    Our Perdita is found.

HERMIONE

    You gods, look down
    And from your sacred vials pour your graces
    Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
    Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
    Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
    Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
    Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
    Myself to see the issue.

PAULINA

    There's time enough for that;
    Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
    Your joys with like relation. Go together,
    You precious winners all; your exultation
    Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
    Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
    My mate, that's never to be found again,
    Lament till I am lost.

LEONTES

    O, peace, Paulina!
    Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
    As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
    And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
    But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
    As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
    A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
    For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
    An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
    And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
    Is richly noted and here justified
    By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
    What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
    That e'er I put between your holy looks
    My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
    And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
    Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
    Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
    Each one demand an answer to his part
    Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
    We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.

    Exeunt

Antony and Cleopatra

ACT I
SCENE I. Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.

    Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO

PHILO

    Nay, but this dotage of our general's
    O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
    That o'er the files and musters of the war
    Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
    The office and devotion of their view
    Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
    Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
    The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
    And is become the bellows and the fan
    To cool a gipsy's lust.

    Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies, the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her
    Look, where they come:
    Take but good note, and you shall see in him.
    The triple pillar of the world transform'd
    Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.

CLEOPATRA

    If it be love indeed, tell me how much.

MARK ANTONY

    There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.

CLEOPATRA

    I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.

MARK ANTONY

    Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.

    Enter an Attendant

Attendant

    News, my good lord, from Rome.

MARK ANTONY

    Grates me: the sum.

CLEOPATRA

    Nay, hear them, Antony:
    Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
    If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
    His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
    Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
    Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'

MARK ANTONY

    How, my love!

CLEOPATRA

    Perchance! nay, and most like:
    You must not stay here longer, your dismission
    Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
    Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
    Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
    Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine
    Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
    When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!

MARK ANTONY

    Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
    Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
    Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
    Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
    Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair

    Embracing
    And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
    On pain of punishment, the world to weet
    We stand up peerless.

CLEOPATRA

    Excellent falsehood!
    Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
    I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
    Will be himself.

MARK ANTONY

    But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
    Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
    Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
    There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
    Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?

CLEOPATRA

    Hear the ambassadors.

MARK ANTONY

    Fie, wrangling queen!
    Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
    To weep; whose every passion fully strives
    To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
    No messenger, but thine; and all alone
    To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
    The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
    Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.

    Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with their train

DEMETRIUS

    Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?

PHILO

    Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
    He comes too short of that great property
    Which still should go with Antony.

DEMETRIUS

    I am full sorry
    That he approves the common liar, who
    Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
    Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. Another room.

    Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer

CHARMIAN

    Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,
    almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer
    that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
    this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
    with garlands!

ALEXAS

    Soothsayer!

Soothsayer

    Your will?

CHARMIAN

    Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?

Soothsayer

    In nature's infinite book of secrecy
    A little I can read.

ALEXAS

    Show him your hand.

    Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
    Cleopatra's health to drink.

CHARMIAN

    Good sir, give me good fortune.

Soothsayer

    I make not, but foresee.

CHARMIAN

    Pray, then, foresee me one.

Soothsayer

    You shall be yet far fairer than you are.

CHARMIAN

    He means in flesh.

IRAS

    No, you shall paint when you are old.

CHARMIAN

    Wrinkles forbid!

ALEXAS

    Vex not his prescience; be attentive.

CHARMIAN

    Hush!

Soothsayer

    You shall be more beloving than beloved.

CHARMIAN

    I had rather heat my liver with drinking.

ALEXAS

    Nay, hear him.

CHARMIAN

    Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married
    to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
    let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
    may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
    Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.

Soothsayer

    You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.

CHARMIAN

    O excellent! I love long life better than figs.

Soothsayer

    You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
    Than that which is to approach.

CHARMIAN

    Then belike my children shall have no names:
    prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?

Soothsayer

    If every of your wishes had a womb.
    And fertile every wish, a million.

CHARMIAN

    Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.

ALEXAS

    You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.

CHARMIAN

    Nay, come, tell Iras hers.

ALEXAS

    We'll know all our fortunes.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall
    be--drunk to bed.

IRAS

    There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.

CHARMIAN

    E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.

IRAS

    Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.

CHARMIAN

    Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
    prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
    tell her but a worky-day fortune.

Soothsayer

    Your fortunes are alike.

IRAS

    But how, but how? give me particulars.

Soothsayer

    I have said.

IRAS

    Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?

CHARMIAN

    Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than
    I, where would you choose it?

IRAS

    Not in my husband's nose.

CHARMIAN

    Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,
    his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
    that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
    her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
    follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
    laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
    Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
    matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!

IRAS

    Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!
    for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
    loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
    foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep
    decorum, and fortune him accordingly!

CHARMIAN

    Amen.

ALEXAS

    Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a
    cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
    they'ld do't!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Hush! here comes Antony.

CHARMIAN

    Not he; the queen.

    Enter CLEOPATRA

CLEOPATRA

    Saw you my lord?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    No, lady.

CLEOPATRA

    Was he not here?

CHARMIAN

    No, madam.

CLEOPATRA

    He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden
    A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Madam?

CLEOPATRA

    Seek him, and bring him hither.
    Where's Alexas?

ALEXAS

    Here, at your service. My lord approaches.

CLEOPATRA

    We will not look upon him: go with us.

    Exeunt

    Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants

Messenger

    Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.

MARK ANTONY

    Against my brother Lucius?

Messenger

    Ay:
    But soon that war had end, and the time's state
    Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;
    Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,
    Upon the first encounter, drave them.

MARK ANTONY

    Well, what worst?

Messenger

    The nature of bad news infects the teller.

MARK ANTONY

    When it concerns the fool or coward. On:
    Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
    Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
    I hear him as he flatter'd.

Messenger

    Labienus--
    This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,
    Extended Asia from Euphrates;
    His conquering banner shook from Syria
    To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--

MARK ANTONY

    Antony, thou wouldst say,--

Messenger

    O, my lord!

MARK ANTONY

    Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:
    Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
    Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
    With such full licence as both truth and malice
    Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,
    When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us
    Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.

Messenger

    At your noble pleasure.

    Exit

MARK ANTONY

    From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!

First Attendant

    The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?

Second Attendant

    He stays upon your will.

MARK ANTONY

    Let him appear.
    These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
    Or lose myself in dotage.

    Enter another Messenger
    What are you?

Second Messenger

    Fulvia thy wife is dead.

MARK ANTONY

    Where died she?

Second Messenger

    In Sicyon:
    Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
    Importeth thee to know, this bears.

    Gives a letter

MARK ANTONY

    Forbear me.

    Exit Second Messenger
    There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
    What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
    We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
    By revolution lowering, does become
    The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
    The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
    I must from this enchanting queen break off:
    Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
    My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!

    Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    What's your pleasure, sir?

MARK ANTONY

    I must with haste from hence.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Why, then, we kill all our women:
    we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
    if they suffer our departure, death's the word.

MARK ANTONY

    I must be gone.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
    pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
    them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
    nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
    this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
    times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
    mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
    her, she hath such a celerity in dying.

MARK ANTONY

    She is cunning past man's thought.

    Exit ALEXAS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
    the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
    winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
    storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
    cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
    shower of rain as well as Jove.

MARK ANTONY

    Would I had never seen her.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
    of work; which not to have been blest withal would
    have discredited your travel.

MARK ANTONY

    Fulvia is dead.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Sir?

MARK ANTONY

    Fulvia is dead.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Fulvia!

MARK ANTONY

    Dead.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When
    it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
    from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
    comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
    out, there are members to make new. If there were
    no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
    and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
    with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
    petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
    that should water this sorrow.

MARK ANTONY

    The business she hath broached in the state
    Cannot endure my absence.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    And the business you have broached here cannot be
    without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which
    wholly depends on your abode.

MARK ANTONY

    No more light answers. Let our officers
    Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
    The cause of our expedience to the queen,
    And get her leave to part. For not alone
    The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
    Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
    Of many our contriving friends in Rome
    Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
    Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
    The empire of the sea: our slippery people,
    Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
    Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
    Pompey the Great and all his dignities
    Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
    Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
    For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
    The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,
    Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
    And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
    To such whose place is under us, requires
    Our quick remove from hence.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    I shall do't.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. Another room.

    Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

CLEOPATRA

    Where is he?

CHARMIAN

    I did not see him since.

CLEOPATRA

    See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
    I did not send you: if you find him sad,
    Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
    That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.

    Exit ALEXAS

CHARMIAN

    Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
    You do not hold the method to enforce
    The like from him.

CLEOPATRA

    What should I do, I do not?

CHARMIAN

    In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.

CLEOPATRA

    Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.

CHARMIAN

    Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:
    In time we hate that which we often fear.
    But here comes Antony.

    Enter MARK ANTONY

CLEOPATRA

    I am sick and sullen.

MARK ANTONY

    I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--

CLEOPATRA

    Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:
    It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature
    Will not sustain it.

MARK ANTONY

    Now, my dearest queen,--

CLEOPATRA

    Pray you, stand further from me.

MARK ANTONY

    What's the matter?

CLEOPATRA

    I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.
    What says the married woman? You may go:
    Would she had never given you leave to come!
    Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:
    I have no power upon you; hers you are.

MARK ANTONY

    The gods best know,--

CLEOPATRA

    O, never was there queen
    So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
    I saw the treasons planted.

MARK ANTONY

    Cleopatra,--

CLEOPATRA

    Why should I think you can be mine and true,
    Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
    Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
    To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
    Which break themselves in swearing!

MARK ANTONY

    Most sweet queen,--

CLEOPATRA

    Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
    But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,
    Then was the time for words: no going then;
    Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
    Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,
    But was a race of heaven: they are so still,
    Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
    Art turn'd the greatest liar.

MARK ANTONY

    How now, lady!

CLEOPATRA

    I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know
    There were a heart in Egypt.

MARK ANTONY

    Hear me, queen:
    The strong necessity of time commands
    Our services awhile; but my full heart
    Remains in use with you. Our Italy
    Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
    Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:
    Equality of two domestic powers
    Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,
    Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,
    Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
    Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
    Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
    And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
    By any desperate change: my more particular,
    And that which most with you should safe my going,
    Is Fulvia's death.

CLEOPATRA

    Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
    It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?

MARK ANTONY

    She's dead, my queen:
    Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
    The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:
    See when and where she died.

CLEOPATRA

    O most false love!
    Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
    With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
    In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.

MARK ANTONY

    Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
    The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
    As you shall give the advice. By the fire
    That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
    Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war
    As thou affect'st.

CLEOPATRA

    Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
    But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,
    So Antony loves.

MARK ANTONY

    My precious queen, forbear;
    And give true evidence to his love, which stands
    An honourable trial.

CLEOPATRA

    So Fulvia told me.
    I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,
    Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
    Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
    Of excellent dissembling; and let it look
    Life perfect honour.

MARK ANTONY

    You'll heat my blood: no more.

CLEOPATRA

    You can do better yet; but this is meetly.

MARK ANTONY

    Now, by my sword,--

CLEOPATRA

    And target. Still he mends;
    But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
    How this Herculean Roman does become
    The carriage of his chafe.

MARK ANTONY

    I'll leave you, lady.

CLEOPATRA

    Courteous lord, one word.
    Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:
    Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;
    That you know well: something it is I would,
    O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
    And I am all forgotten.

MARK ANTONY

    But that your royalty
    Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
    For idleness itself.

CLEOPATRA

    'Tis sweating labour
    To bear such idleness so near the heart
    As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
    Since my becomings kill me, when they do not
    Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
    Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
    And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
    Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
    Be strew'd before your feet!

MARK ANTONY

    Let us go. Come;
    Our separation so abides, and flies,
    That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,
    And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

    Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS, and their Train

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
    It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
    Our great competitor: from Alexandria
    This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
    The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like
    Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy
    More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
    Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there
    A man who is the abstract of all faults
    That all men follow.

LEPIDUS

    I must not think there are
    Evils enow to darken all his goodness:
    His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
    More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,
    Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
    Than what he chooses.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not
    Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;
    To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit
    And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;
    To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
    With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
    becomes him,--
    As his composure must be rare indeed
    Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony
    No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
    So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
    His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
    Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
    Call on him for't: but to confound such time,
    That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
    As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid
    As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
    Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
    And so rebel to judgment.

    Enter a Messenger

LEPIDUS

    Here's more news.

Messenger

    Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
    Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
    How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;
    And it appears he is beloved of those
    That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports
    The discontents repair, and men's reports
    Give him much wrong'd.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    I should have known no less.
    It hath been taught us from the primal state,
    That he which is was wish'd until he were;
    And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,
    Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
    Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
    Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
    To rot itself with motion.

Messenger

    Caesar, I bring thee word,
    Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
    Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
    With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
    They make in Italy; the borders maritime
    Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
    No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
    Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
    Than could his war resisted.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Antony,
    Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
    Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
    Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
    Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
    Though daintily brought up, with patience more
    Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
    The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
    Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
    The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
    Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
    The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
    It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
    Which some did die to look on: and all this--
    It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
    Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
    So much as lank'd not.

LEPIDUS

    'Tis pity of him.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Let his shames quickly
    Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain
    Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end
    Assemble we immediate council: Pompey
    Thrives in our idleness.

LEPIDUS

    To-morrow, Caesar,
    I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
    Both what by sea and land I can be able
    To front this present time.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Till which encounter,
    It is my business too. Farewell.

LEPIDUS

    Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime
    Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
    To let me be partaker.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Doubt not, sir;
    I knew it for my bond.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

    Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN

CLEOPATRA

    Charmian!

CHARMIAN

    Madam?

CLEOPATRA

    Ha, ha!
    Give me to drink mandragora.

CHARMIAN

    Why, madam?

CLEOPATRA

    That I might sleep out this great gap of time
    My Antony is away.

CHARMIAN

    You think of him too much.

CLEOPATRA

    O, 'tis treason!

CHARMIAN

    Madam, I trust, not so.

CLEOPATRA

    Thou, eunuch Mardian!

MARDIAN

    What's your highness' pleasure?

CLEOPATRA

    Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
    In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,
    That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
    May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?

MARDIAN

    Yes, gracious madam.

CLEOPATRA

    Indeed!

MARDIAN

    Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
    But what indeed is honest to be done:
    Yet have I fierce affections, and think
    What Venus did with Mars.

CLEOPATRA

    O Charmian,
    Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
    Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
    O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
    Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?
    The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
    And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
    Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
    For so he calls me: now I feed myself
    With most delicious poison. Think on me,
    That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
    And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
    When thou wast here above the ground, I was
    A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
    Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
    There would he anchor his aspect and die
    With looking on his life.

    Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR

ALEXAS

    Sovereign of Egypt, hail!

CLEOPATRA

    How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
    Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
    With his tinct gilded thee.
    How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?

ALEXAS

    Last thing he did, dear queen,
    He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--
    This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.

CLEOPATRA

    Mine ear must pluck it thence.

ALEXAS

    'Good friend,' quoth he,
    'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
    This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
    To mend the petty present, I will piece
    Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
    Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
    And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
    Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke
    Was beastly dumb'd by him.

CLEOPATRA

    What, was he sad or merry?

ALEXAS

    Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
    Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.

CLEOPATRA

    O well-divided disposition! Note him,
    Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
    He was not sad, for he would shine on those
    That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
    Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
    In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
    O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
    The violence of either thee becomes,
    So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?

ALEXAS

    Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:
    Why do you send so thick?

CLEOPATRA

    Who's born that day
    When I forget to send to Antony,
    Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
    Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
    Ever love Caesar so?

CHARMIAN

    O that brave Caesar!

CLEOPATRA

    Be choked with such another emphasis!
    Say, the brave Antony.

CHARMIAN

    The valiant Caesar!

CLEOPATRA

    By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
    If thou with Caesar paragon again
    My man of men.

CHARMIAN

    By your most gracious pardon,
    I sing but after you.

CLEOPATRA

    My salad days,
    When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,
    To say as I said then! But, come, away;
    Get me ink and paper:
    He shall have every day a several greeting,
    Or I'll unpeople Egypt.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Messina. POMPEY's house.

    Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in warlike manner

POMPEY

    If the great gods be just, they shall assist
    The deeds of justest men.

MENECRATES

    Know, worthy Pompey,
    That what they do delay, they not deny.

POMPEY

    Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
    The thing we sue for.

MENECRATES

    We, ignorant of ourselves,
    Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
    Deny us for our good; so find we profit
    By losing of our prayers.

POMPEY

    I shall do well:
    The people love me, and the sea is mine;
    My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
    Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
    In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
    No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
    He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
    Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
    Nor either cares for him.

MENAS

    Caesar and Lepidus
    Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.

POMPEY

    Where have you this? 'tis false.

MENAS

    From Silvius, sir.

POMPEY

    He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,
    Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
    Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
    Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
    Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
    Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks
    Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;
    That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
    Even till a Lethe'd dulness!

    Enter VARRIUS
    How now, Varrius!

VARRIUS

    This is most certain that I shall deliver:
    Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
    Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis
    A space for further travel.

POMPEY

    I could have given less matter
    A better ear. Menas, I did not think
    This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
    For such a petty war: his soldiership
    Is twice the other twain: but let us rear
    The higher our opinion, that our stirring
    Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
    The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.

MENAS

    I cannot hope
    Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:
    His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
    His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
    Not moved by Antony.

POMPEY

    I know not, Menas,
    How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
    Were't not that we stand up against them all,
    'Twere pregnant they should square between
    themselves;
    For they have entertained cause enough
    To draw their swords: but how the fear of us
    May cement their divisions and bind up
    The petty difference, we yet not know.
    Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
    Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
    Come, Menas.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Rome. The house of LEPIDUS.

    Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS

LEPIDUS

    Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
    And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
    To soft and gentle speech.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    I shall entreat him
    To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,
    Let Antony look over Caesar's head
    And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
    Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
    I would not shave't to-day.

LEPIDUS

    'Tis not a time
    For private stomaching.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Every time
    Serves for the matter that is then born in't.

LEPIDUS

    But small to greater matters must give way.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Not if the small come first.

LEPIDUS

    Your speech is passion:
    But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes
    The noble Antony.

    Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    And yonder, Caesar.

    Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA

MARK ANTONY

    If we compose well here, to Parthia:
    Hark, Ventidius.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    I do not know,
    Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.

LEPIDUS

    Noble friends,
    That which combined us was most great, and let not
    A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
    May it be gently heard: when we debate
    Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
    Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,
    The rather, for I earnestly beseech,
    Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
    Nor curstness grow to the matter.

MARK ANTONY

    'Tis spoken well.
    Were we before our armies, and to fight.
    I should do thus.

    Flourish

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Welcome to Rome.

MARK ANTONY

    Thank you.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Sit.

MARK ANTONY

    Sit, sir.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Nay, then.

MARK ANTONY

    I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
    Or being, concern you not.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    I must be laugh'd at,
    If, or for nothing or a little, I
    Should say myself offended, and with you
    Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should
    Once name you derogately, when to sound your name
    It not concern'd me.

MARK ANTONY

    My being in Egypt, Caesar,
    What was't to you?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    No more than my residing here at Rome
    Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there
    Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
    Might be my question.

MARK ANTONY

    How intend you, practised?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
    By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother
    Made wars upon me; and their contestation
    Was theme for you, you were the word of war.

MARK ANTONY

    You do mistake your business; my brother never
    Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
    And have my learning from some true reports,
    That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
    Discredit my authority with yours;
    And make the wars alike against my stomach,
    Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
    Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
    As matter whole you have not to make it with,
    It must not be with this.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    You praise yourself
    By laying defects of judgment to me; but
    You patch'd up your excuses.

MARK ANTONY

    Not so, not so;
    I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
    Very necessity of this thought, that I,
    Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
    Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
    Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
    I would you had her spirit in such another:
    The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle
    You may pace easy, but not such a wife.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Would we had all such wives, that the men might go
    to wars with the women!

MARK ANTONY

    So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar
    Made out of her impatience, which not wanted
    Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant
    Did you too much disquiet: for that you must
    But say, I could not help it.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    I wrote to you
    When rioting in Alexandria; you
    Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
    Did gibe my missive out of audience.

MARK ANTONY

    Sir,
    He fell upon me ere admitted: then
    Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
    Of what I was i' the morning: but next day
    I told him of myself; which was as much
    As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
    Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
    Out of our question wipe him.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    You have broken
    The article of your oath; which you shall never
    Have tongue to charge me with.

LEPIDUS

    Soft, Caesar!

MARK ANTONY

    No,
    Lepidus, let him speak:
    The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
    Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;
    The article of my oath.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    To lend me arms and aid when I required them;
    The which you both denied.

MARK ANTONY

    Neglected, rather;
    And then when poison'd hours had bound me up
    From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
    I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty
    Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
    Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
    To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
    For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
    So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
    To stoop in such a case.

LEPIDUS

    'Tis noble spoken.

MECAENAS

    If it might please you, to enforce no further
    The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
    Were to remember that the present need
    Speaks to atone you.

LEPIDUS

    Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Or, if you borrow one another's love for the
    instant, you may, when you hear no more words of
    Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to
    wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.

MARK ANTONY

    Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.

MARK ANTONY

    You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Go to, then; your considerate stone.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    I do not much dislike the matter, but
    The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
    We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
    So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew
    What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
    O' the world I would pursue it.

AGRIPPA

    Give me leave, Caesar,--

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Speak, Agrippa.

AGRIPPA

    Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
    Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony
    Is now a widower.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Say not so, Agrippa:
    If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
    Were well deserved of rashness.

MARK ANTONY

    I am not married, Caesar: let me hear
    Agrippa further speak.

AGRIPPA

    To hold you in perpetual amity,
    To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
    With an unslipping knot, take Antony
    Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
    No worse a husband than the best of men;
    Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
    That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
    All little jealousies, which now seem great,
    And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
    Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,
    Where now half tales be truths: her love to both
    Would, each to other and all loves to both,
    Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
    For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
    By duty ruminated.

MARK ANTONY

    Will Caesar speak?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
    With what is spoke already.

MARK ANTONY

    What power is in Agrippa,
    If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'
    To make this good?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    The power of Caesar, and
    His power unto Octavia.

MARK ANTONY

    May I never
    To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
    Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:
    Further this act of grace: and from this hour
    The heart of brothers govern in our loves
    And sway our great designs!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    There is my hand.
    A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
    Did ever love so dearly: let her live
    To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
    Fly off our loves again!

LEPIDUS

    Happily, amen!

MARK ANTONY

    I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
    For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
    Of late upon me: I must thank him only,
    Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
    At heel of that, defy him.

LEPIDUS

    Time calls upon's:
    Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
    Or else he seeks out us.

MARK ANTONY

    Where lies he?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    About the mount Misenum.

MARK ANTONY

    What is his strength by land?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Great and increasing: but by sea
    He is an absolute master.

MARK ANTONY

    So is the fame.
    Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:
    Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
    The business we have talk'd of.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    With most gladness:
    And do invite you to my sister's view,
    Whither straight I'll lead you.

MARK ANTONY

    Let us, Lepidus,
    Not lack your company.

LEPIDUS

    Noble Antony,
    Not sickness should detain me.

    Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, and LEPIDUS

MECAENAS

    Welcome from Egypt, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My
    honourable friend, Agrippa!

AGRIPPA

    Good Enobarbus!

MECAENAS

    We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
    digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and
    made the night light with drinking.

MECAENAS

    Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and
    but twelve persons there; is this true?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more
    monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.

MECAENAS

    She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to
    her.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up
    his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.

AGRIPPA

    There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised
    well for her.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    I will tell you.
    The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
    Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
    Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
    The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
    Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
    The water which they beat to follow faster,
    As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
    It beggar'd all description: she did lie
    In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
    O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
    The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
    Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
    With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
    To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
    And what they undid did.

AGRIPPA

    O, rare for Antony!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
    So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
    And made their bends adornings: at the helm
    A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
    Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
    That yarely frame the office. From the barge
    A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
    Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
    Her people out upon her; and Antony,
    Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,
    Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
    Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
    And made a gap in nature.

AGRIPPA

    Rare Egyptian!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
    Invited her to supper: she replied,
    It should be better he became her guest;
    Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
    Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
    Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
    And for his ordinary pays his heart
    For what his eyes eat only.

AGRIPPA

    Royal wench!
    She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
    He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    I saw her once
    Hop forty paces through the public street;
    And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
    That she did make defect perfection,
    And, breathless, power breathe forth.

MECAENAS

    Now Antony must leave her utterly.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Never; he will not:
    Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
    Her infinite variety: other women cloy
    The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
    Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
    Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
    Bless her when she is riggish.

MECAENAS

    If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
    The heart of Antony, Octavia is
    A blessed lottery to him.

AGRIPPA

    Let us go.
    Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
    Whilst you abide here.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Humbly, sir, I thank you.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

    Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between them, and Attendants

MARK ANTONY

    The world and my great office will sometimes
    Divide me from your bosom.

OCTAVIA

    All which time
    Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
    To them for you.

MARK ANTONY

    Good night, sir. My Octavia,
    Read not my blemishes in the world's report:
    I have not kept my square; but that to come
    Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.
    Good night, sir.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Good night.

    Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA

    Enter Soothsayer

MARK ANTONY

    Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?

Soothsayer

    Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!

MARK ANTONY

    If you can, your reason?

Soothsayer

    I see it in
    My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet
    Hie you to Egypt again.

MARK ANTONY

    Say to me,
    Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?

Soothsayer

    Caesar's.
    Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:
    Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is
    Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,
    Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel
    Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore
    Make space enough between you.

MARK ANTONY

    Speak this no more.

Soothsayer

    To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.
    If thou dost play with him at any game,
    Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,
    He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,
    When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit
    Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
    But, he away, 'tis noble.

MARK ANTONY

    Get thee gone:
    Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:

    Exit Soothsayer
    He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,
    He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;
    And in our sports my better cunning faints
    Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
    His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
    When it is all to nought; and his quails ever
    Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:
    And though I make this marriage for my peace,
    I' the east my pleasure lies.

    Enter VENTIDIUS
    O, come, Ventidius,
    You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;
    Follow me, and receive't.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. A street.

    Enter LEPIDUS, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA

LEPIDUS

    Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten
    Your generals after.

AGRIPPA

    Sir, Mark Antony
    Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.

LEPIDUS

    Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
    Which will become you both, farewell.

MECAENAS

    We shall,
    As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount
    Before you, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS

    Your way is shorter;
    My purposes do draw me much about:
    You'll win two days upon me.

MECAENAS AGRIPPA

    Sir, good success!

LEPIDUS

    Farewell.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

    Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

CLEOPATRA

    Give me some music; music, moody food
    Of us that trade in love.

Attendants

    The music, ho!

    Enter MARDIAN

CLEOPATRA

    Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.

CHARMIAN

    My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.

CLEOPATRA

    As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
    As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?

MARDIAN

    As well as I can, madam.

CLEOPATRA

    And when good will is show'd, though't come
    too short,
    The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:
    Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,
    My music playing far off, I will betray
    Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
    Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,
    I'll think them every one an Antony,
    And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'

CHARMIAN

    'Twas merry when
    You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
    Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
    With fervency drew up.

CLEOPATRA

    That time,--O times!--
    I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
    I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
    Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
    Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
    I wore his sword Philippan.

    Enter a Messenger
    O, from Italy
    Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
    That long time have been barren.

Messenger

    Madam, madam,--

CLEOPATRA

    Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,
    Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,
    If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
    My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings
    Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.

Messenger

    First, madam, he is well.

CLEOPATRA

    Why, there's more gold.
    But, sirrah, mark, we use
    To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
    The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
    Down thy ill-uttering throat.

Messenger

    Good madam, hear me.

CLEOPATRA

    Well, go to, I will;
    But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony
    Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour
    To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
    Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
    Not like a formal man.

Messenger

    Will't please you hear me?

CLEOPATRA

    I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
    Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
    Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
    I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
    Rich pearls upon thee.

Messenger

    Madam, he's well.

CLEOPATRA

    Well said.

Messenger

    And friends with Caesar.

CLEOPATRA

    Thou'rt an honest man.

Messenger

    Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.

CLEOPATRA

    Make thee a fortune from me.

Messenger

    But yet, madam,--

CLEOPATRA

    I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay
    The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!
    'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
    Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
    Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
    The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:
    In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.

Messenger

    Free, madam! no; I made no such report:
    He's bound unto Octavia.

CLEOPATRA

    For what good turn?

Messenger

    For the best turn i' the bed.

CLEOPATRA

    I am pale, Charmian.

Messenger

    Madam, he's married to Octavia.

CLEOPATRA

    The most infectious pestilence upon thee!

    Strikes him down

Messenger

    Good madam, patience.

CLEOPATRA

    What say you? Hence,

    Strikes him again
    Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
    Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:

    She hales him up and down
    Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
    Smarting in lingering pickle.

Messenger

    Gracious madam,
    I that do bring the news made not the match.

CLEOPATRA

    Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
    And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst
    Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
    And I will boot thee with what gift beside
    Thy modesty can beg.

Messenger

    He's married, madam.

CLEOPATRA

    Rogue, thou hast lived too long.

    Draws a knife

Messenger

    Nay, then I'll run.
    What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.

    Exit

CHARMIAN

    Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
    The man is innocent.

CLEOPATRA

    Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
    Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
    Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:
    Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.

CHARMIAN

    He is afeard to come.

CLEOPATRA

    I will not hurt him.

    Exit CHARMIAN
    These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
    A meaner than myself; since I myself
    Have given myself the cause.

    Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger
    Come hither, sir.
    Though it be honest, it is never good
    To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.
    An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
    Themselves when they be felt.

Messenger

    I have done my duty.

CLEOPATRA

    Is he married?
    I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
    If thou again say 'Yes.'

Messenger

    He's married, madam.

CLEOPATRA

    The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?

Messenger

    Should I lie, madam?

CLEOPATRA

    O, I would thou didst,
    So half my Egypt were submerged and made
    A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:
    Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
    Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?

Messenger

    I crave your highness' pardon.

CLEOPATRA

    He is married?

Messenger

    Take no offence that I would not offend you:
    To punish me for what you make me do.
    Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.

CLEOPATRA

    O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,
    That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:
    The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
    Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,
    And be undone by 'em!

    Exit Messenger

CHARMIAN

    Good your highness, patience.

CLEOPATRA

    In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.

CHARMIAN

    Many times, madam.

CLEOPATRA

    I am paid for't now.
    Lead me from hence:
    I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.
    Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
    Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
    Her inclination, let him not leave out
    The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.

    Exit ALEXAS
    Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,
    Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
    The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas

    To MARDIAN
    Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
    But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Near Misenum.

    Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door, with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS, with Soldiers marching

POMPEY

    Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
    And we shall talk before we fight.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Most meet
    That first we come to words; and therefore have we
    Our written purposes before us sent;
    Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know
    If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,
    And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
    That else must perish here.

POMPEY

    To you all three,
    The senators alone of this great world,
    Chief factors for the gods, I do not know
    Wherefore my father should revengers want,
    Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,
    Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
    There saw you labouring for him. What was't
    That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what
    Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
    With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,
    To drench the Capitol; but that they would
    Have one man but a man? And that is it
    Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen
    The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
    To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
    Cast on my noble father.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Take your time.

MARK ANTONY

    Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
    We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st
    How much we do o'er-count thee.

POMPEY

    At land, indeed,
    Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:
    But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
    Remain in't as thou mayst.

LEPIDUS

    Be pleased to tell us--
    For this is from the present--how you take
    The offers we have sent you.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    There's the point.

MARK ANTONY

    Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
    What it is worth embraced.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    And what may follow,
    To try a larger fortune.

POMPEY

    You have made me offer
    Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
    Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
    Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon
    To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
    Our targes undinted.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS

    That's our offer.

POMPEY

    Know, then,
    I came before you here a man prepared
    To take this offer: but Mark Antony
    Put me to some impatience: though I lose
    The praise of it by telling, you must know,
    When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
    Your mother came to Sicily and did find
    Her welcome friendly.

MARK ANTONY

    I have heard it, Pompey;
    And am well studied for a liberal thanks
    Which I do owe you.

POMPEY

    Let me have your hand:
    I did not think, sir, to have met you here.

MARK ANTONY

    The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,
    That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
    For I have gain'd by 't.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Since I saw you last,
    There is a change upon you.

POMPEY

    Well, I know not
    What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
    But in my bosom shall she never come,
    To make my heart her vassal.

LEPIDUS

    Well met here.

POMPEY

    I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:
    I crave our composition may be written,
    And seal'd between us.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    That's the next to do.

POMPEY

    We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
    Draw lots who shall begin.

MARK ANTONY

    That will I, Pompey.

POMPEY

    No, Antony, take the lot: but, first
    Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
    Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
    Grew fat with feasting there.

MARK ANTONY

    You have heard much.

POMPEY

    I have fair meanings, sir.

MARK ANTONY

    And fair words to them.

POMPEY

    Then so much have I heard:
    And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    No more of that: he did so.

POMPEY

    What, I pray you?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.

POMPEY

    I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Well;
    And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
    Four feasts are toward.

POMPEY

    Let me shake thy hand;
    I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
    When I have envied thy behavior.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Sir,
    I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,
    When you have well deserved ten times as much
    As I have said you did.

POMPEY

    Enjoy thy plainness,
    It nothing ill becomes thee.
    Aboard my galley I invite you all:
    Will you lead, lords?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR MARK ANTONY LEPIDUS

    Show us the way, sir.

POMPEY

    Come.

    Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS

MENAS

    [Aside] Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have
    made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    At sea, I think.

MENAS

    We have, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    You have done well by water.

MENAS

    And you by land.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    I will praise any man that will praise me; though it
    cannot be denied what I have done by land.

MENAS

    Nor what I have done by water.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Yes, something you can deny for your own
    safety: you have been a great thief by sea.

MENAS

    And you by land.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    There I deny my land service. But give me your
    hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they
    might take two thieves kissing.

MENAS

    All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    But there is never a fair woman has a true face.

MENAS

    No slander; they steal hearts.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    We came hither to fight with you.

MENAS

    For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
    Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.

MENAS

    You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
    here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Caesar's sister is called Octavia.

MENAS

    True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.

MENAS

    Pray ye, sir?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    'Tis true.

MENAS

    Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would
    not prophesy so.

MENAS

    I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
    marriage than the love of the parties.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    I think so too. But you shall find, the band that
    seems to tie their friendship together will be the
    very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
    holy, cold, and still conversation.

MENAS

    Who would not have his wife so?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
    He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
    sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
    I said before, that which is the strength of their
    amity shall prove the immediate author of their
    variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
    he married but his occasion here.

MENAS

    And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?
    I have a health for you.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.

MENAS

    Come, let's away.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.

    Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with a banquet

First Servant

    Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
    ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
    will blow them down.

Second Servant

    Lepidus is high-coloured.

First Servant

    They have made him drink alms-drink.

Second Servant

    As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
    cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his
    entreaty, and himself to the drink.

First Servant

    But it raises the greater war between him and
    his discretion.

Second Servant

    Why, this is to have a name in great men's
    fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
    me no service as a partisan I could not heave.

First Servant

    To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
    to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,
    which pitifully disaster the cheeks.

    A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains

MARK ANTONY

    [To OCTAVIUS CAESAR] Thus do they, sir: they take
    the flow o' the Nile
    By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,
    By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
    Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,
    The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman
    Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
    And shortly comes to harvest.

LEPIDUS

    You've strange serpents there.

MARK ANTONY

    Ay, Lepidus.

LEPIDUS

    Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
    operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.

MARK ANTONY

    They are so.

POMPEY

    Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!

LEPIDUS

    I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.

LEPIDUS

    Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'
    pyramises are very goodly things; without
    contradiction, I have heard that.

MENAS

    [Aside to POMPEY] Pompey, a word.

POMPEY

    [Aside to MENAS] Say in mine ear:
    what is't?

MENAS

    [Aside to POMPEY] Forsake thy seat, I do beseech
    thee, captain,
    And hear me speak a word.

POMPEY

    [Aside to MENAS] Forbear me till anon.
    This wine for Lepidus!

LEPIDUS

    What manner o' thing is your crocodile?

MARK ANTONY

    It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad
    as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,
    and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
    which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of
    it, it transmigrates.

LEPIDUS

    What colour is it of?

MARK ANTONY

    Of it own colour too.

LEPIDUS

    'Tis a strange serpent.

MARK ANTONY

    'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Will this description satisfy him?

MARK ANTONY

    With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a
    very epicure.

POMPEY

    [Aside to MENAS] Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
    that? away!
    Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?

MENAS

    [Aside to POMPEY] If for the sake of merit thou
    wilt hear me,
    Rise from thy stool.

POMPEY

    [Aside to MENAS] I think thou'rt mad.
    The matter?

    Rises, and walks aside

MENAS

    I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.

POMPEY

    Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
    Be jolly, lords.

MARK ANTONY

    These quick-sands, Lepidus,
    Keep off them, for you sink.

MENAS

    Wilt thou be lord of all the world?

POMPEY

    What say'st thou?

MENAS

    Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.

POMPEY

    How should that be?

MENAS

    But entertain it,
    And, though thou think me poor, I am the man
    Will give thee all the world.

POMPEY

    Hast thou drunk well?

MENAS

    Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
    Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:
    Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
    Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.

POMPEY

    Show me which way.

MENAS

    These three world-sharers, these competitors,
    Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;
    And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
    All there is thine.

POMPEY

    Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
    And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;
    In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,
    'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;
    Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
    Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,
    I should have found it afterwards well done;
    But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.

MENAS

    [Aside] For this,
    I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
    Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
    Shall never find it more.

POMPEY

    This health to Lepidus!

MARK ANTONY

    Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Here's to thee, Menas!

MENAS

    Enobarbus, welcome!

POMPEY

    Fill till the cup be hid.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    There's a strong fellow, Menas.

    Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS

MENAS

    Why?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st
    not?

MENAS

    The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,
    That it might go on wheels!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Drink thou; increase the reels.

MENAS

    Come.

POMPEY

    This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.

MARK ANTONY

    It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?
    Here is to Caesar!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    I could well forbear't.
    It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
    And it grows fouler.

MARK ANTONY

    Be a child o' the time.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Possess it, I'll make answer:
    But I had rather fast from all four days
    Than drink so much in one.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Ha, my brave emperor!

    To MARK ANTONY
    Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
    And celebrate our drink?

POMPEY

    Let's ha't, good soldier.

MARK ANTONY

    Come, let's all take hands,
    Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
    In soft and delicate Lethe.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    All take hands.
    Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
    The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
    The holding every man shall bear as loud
    As his strong sides can volley.

    Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them hand in hand
    THE SONG.
    Come, thou monarch of the vine,
    Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
    In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
    With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
    Cup us, till the world go round,
    Cup us, till the world go round!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
    Let me request you off: our graver business
    Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
    You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
    Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue
    Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
    Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
    Good Antony, your hand.

POMPEY

    I'll try you on the shore.

MARK ANTONY

    And shall, sir; give's your hand.

POMPEY

    O Antony,
    You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.
    Come, down into the boat.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Take heed you fall not.

    Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS
    Menas, I'll not on shore.

MENAS

    No, to my cabin.
    These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
    Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
    To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!

    Sound a flourish, with drums

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Ho! says a' There's my cap.

MENAS

    Ho! Noble captain, come.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A plain in Syria.

    Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS, and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead body of PACORUS borne before him

VENTIDIUS

    Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
    Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
    Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
    Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
    Pays this for Marcus Crassus.

SILIUS

    Noble Ventidius,
    Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
    The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
    Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
    The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
    Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
    Put garlands on thy head.

VENTIDIUS

    O Silius, Silius,
    I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
    May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;
    Better to leave undone, than by our deed
    Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
    Caesar and Antony have ever won
    More in their officer than person: Sossius,
    One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
    For quick accumulation of renown,
    Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
    Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
    Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,
    The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
    Than gain which darkens him.
    I could do more to do Antonius good,
    But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
    Should my performance perish.

SILIUS

    Thou hast, Ventidius,
    that
    Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
    Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!

VENTIDIUS

    I'll humbly signify what in his name,
    That magical word of war, we have effected;
    How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
    The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
    We have jaded out o' the field.

SILIUS

    Where is he now?

VENTIDIUS

    He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste
    The weight we must convey with's will permit,
    We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

    Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS at another

AGRIPPA

    What, are the brothers parted?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;
    The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
    To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
    Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
    With the green sickness.

AGRIPPA

    'Tis a noble Lepidus.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!

AGRIPPA

    Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.

AGRIPPA

    What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!

AGRIPPA

    O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.

AGRIPPA

    Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
    Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
    poets, cannot
    Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
    His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
    Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.

AGRIPPA

    Both he loves.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    They are his shards, and he their beetle.

    Trumpets within
    So;
    This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.

AGRIPPA

    Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.

    Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA

MARK ANTONY

    No further, sir.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    You take from me a great part of myself;
    Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
    As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
    Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
    Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
    Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
    To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
    The fortress of it; for better might we
    Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
    This be not cherish'd.

MARK ANTONY

    Make me not offended
    In your distrust.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    I have said.

MARK ANTONY

    You shall not find,
    Though you be therein curious, the least cause
    For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
    And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
    We will here part.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:
    The elements be kind to thee, and make
    Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.

OCTAVIA

    My noble brother!

MARK ANTONY

    The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
    And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.

OCTAVIA

    Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    What, Octavia?

OCTAVIA

    I'll tell you in your ear.

MARK ANTONY

    Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
    Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's
    down-feather,
    That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
    And neither way inclines.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    [Aside to AGRIPPA] Will Caesar weep?

AGRIPPA

    [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] He has a cloud in 's face.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    [Aside to AGRIPPA] He were the worse for that,
    were he a horse;
    So is he, being a man.

AGRIPPA

    [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] Why, Enobarbus,
    When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
    He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
    When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    [Aside to AGRIPPA] That year, indeed, he was
    troubled with a rheum;
    What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
    Believe't, till I wept too.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    No, sweet Octavia,
    You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
    Out-go my thinking on you.

MARK ANTONY

    Come, sir, come;
    I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
    Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
    And give you to the gods.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Adieu; be happy!

LEPIDUS

    Let all the number of the stars give light
    To thy fair way!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Farewell, fa rewell!

    Kisses OCTAVIA

MARK ANTONY

    Farewell!

    Trumpets sound. Exeunt

SCENE III. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

    Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS

CLEOPATRA

    Where is the fellow?

ALEXAS

    Half afeard to come.

CLEOPATRA

    Go to, go to.

    Enter the Messenger as before
    Come hither, sir.

ALEXAS

    Good majesty,
    Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
    But when you are well pleased.

CLEOPATRA

    That Herod's head
    I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
    Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.

Messenger

    Most gracious majesty,--

CLEOPATRA

    Didst thou behold Octavia?

Messenger

    Ay, dread queen.

CLEOPATRA

    Where?

Messenger

    Madam, in Rome;
    I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
    Between her brother and Mark Antony.

CLEOPATRA

    Is she as tall as me?

Messenger

    She is not, madam.

CLEOPATRA

    Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?

Messenger

    Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.

CLEOPATRA

    That's not so good: he cannot like her long.

CHARMIAN

    Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.

CLEOPATRA

    I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
    What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
    If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.

Messenger

    She creeps:
    Her motion and her station are as one;
    She shows a body rather than a life,
    A statue than a breather.

CLEOPATRA

    Is this certain?

Messenger

    Or I have no observance.

CHARMIAN

    Three in Egypt
    Cannot make better note.

CLEOPATRA

    He's very knowing;
    I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
    The fellow has good judgment.

CHARMIAN

    Excellent.

CLEOPATRA

    Guess at her years, I prithee.

Messenger

    Madam,
    She was a widow,--

CLEOPATRA

    Widow! Charmian, hark.

Messenger

    And I do think she's thirty.

CLEOPATRA

    Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?

Messenger

    Round even to faultiness.

CLEOPATRA

    For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
    Her hair, what colour?

Messenger

    Brown, madam: and her forehead
    As low as she would wish it.

CLEOPATRA

    There's gold for thee.
    Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
    I will employ thee back again; I find thee
    Most fit for business: go make thee ready;
    Our letters are prepared.

    Exit Messenger

CHARMIAN

    A proper man.

CLEOPATRA

    Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
    That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
    This creature's no such thing.

CHARMIAN

    Nothing, madam.

CLEOPATRA

    The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.

CHARMIAN

    Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
    And serving you so long!

CLEOPATRA

    I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
    But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
    Where I will write. All may be well enough.

CHARMIAN

    I warrant you, madam.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house.

    Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA

MARK ANTONY

    Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--
    That were excusable, that, and thousands more
    Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
    New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
    To public ear:
    Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not
    But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
    He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:
    When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
    Or did it from his teeth.

OCTAVIA

    O my good lord,
    Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
    Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
    If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
    Praying for both parts:
    The good gods me presently,
    When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'
    Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
    'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
    Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
    'Twixt these extremes at all.

MARK ANTONY

    Gentle Octavia,
    Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
    Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,
    I lose myself: better I were not yours
    Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
    Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,
    I'll raise the preparation of a war
    Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;
    So your desires are yours.

OCTAVIA

    Thanks to my lord.
    The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
    Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
    As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
    Should solder up the rift.

MARK ANTONY

    When it appears to you where this begins,
    Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults
    Can never be so equal, that your love
    Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
    Choose your own company, and command what cost
    Your heart has mind to.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. The same. Another room.

    Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    How now, friend Eros!

EROS

    There's strange news come, sir.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    What, man?

EROS

    Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    This is old: what is the success?

EROS

    Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst
    Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let
    him partake in the glory of the action: and not
    resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
    wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so
    the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
    And throw between them all the food thou hast,
    They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?

EROS

    He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
    The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'
    And threats the throat of that his officer
    That murder'd Pompey.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Our great navy's rigg'd.

EROS

    For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;
    My lord desires you presently: my news
    I might have told hereafter.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    'Twill be naught:
    But let it be. Bring me to Antony.

EROS

    Come, sir.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.

    Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,
    In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:
    I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
    Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
    Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat
    Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
    And all the unlawful issue that their lust
    Since then hath made between them. Unto her
    He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
    Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
    Absolute queen.

MECAENAS

    This in the public eye?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
    His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
    Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.
    He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
    Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she
    In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
    That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
    As 'tis reported, so.

MECAENAS

    Let Rome be thus Inform'd.

AGRIPPA

    Who, queasy with his insolence
    Already, will their good thoughts call from him.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    The people know it; and have now received
    His accusations.

AGRIPPA

    Who does he accuse?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Caesar: and that, having in Sicily
    Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
    His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me
    Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets
    That Lepidus of the triumvirate
    Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain
    All his revenue.

AGRIPPA

    Sir, this should be answer'd.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
    I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;
    That he his high authority abused,
    And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
    I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,
    And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
    Demand the like.

MECAENAS

    He'll never yield to that.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Nor must not then be yielded to in this.

    Enter OCTAVIA with her train

OCTAVIA

    Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    That ever I should call thee castaway!

OCTAVIA

    You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not
    Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony
    Should have an army for an usher, and
    The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
    Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
    Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
    Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
    Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
    Raised by your populous troops: but you are come
    A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented
    The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
    Is often left unloved; we should have met you
    By sea and land; supplying every stage
    With an augmented greeting.

OCTAVIA

    Good my lord,
    To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did
    On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
    Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
    My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
    His pardon for return.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Which soon he granted,
    Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.

OCTAVIA

    Do not say so, my lord.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    I have eyes upon him,
    And his affairs come to me on the wind.
    Where is he now?

OCTAVIA

    My lord, in Athens.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra
    Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
    Up to a whore; who now are levying
    The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled
    Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,
    Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
    Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
    King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
    Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
    Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
    The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
    With a more larger list of sceptres.

OCTAVIA

    Ay me, most wretched,
    That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
    That do afflict each other!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Welcome hither:
    Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;
    Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,
    And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
    Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
    O'er your content these strong necessities;
    But let determined things to destiny
    Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
    Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
    Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,
    To do you justice, make them ministers
    Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;
    And ever welcome to us.

AGRIPPA

    Welcome, lady.

MECAENAS

    Welcome, dear madam.
    Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
    Only the adulterous Antony, most large
    In his abominations, turns you off;
    And gives his potent regiment to a trull,
    That noises it against us.

OCTAVIA

    Is it so, sir?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,
    Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.

    Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

CLEOPATRA

    I will be even with thee, doubt it not.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    But why, why, why?

CLEOPATRA

    Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
    And say'st it is not fit.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Well, is it, is it?

CLEOPATRA

    If not denounced against us, why should not we
    Be there in person?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    [Aside] Well, I could reply:
    If we should serve with horse and mares together,
    The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
    A soldier and his horse.

CLEOPATRA

    What is't you say?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
    Take from his heart, take from his brain,
    from's time,
    What should not then be spared. He is already
    Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
    That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
    Manage this war.

CLEOPATRA

    Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
    That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,
    And, as the president of my kingdom, will
    Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:
    I will not stay behind.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Nay, I have done.
    Here comes the emperor.

    Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS

MARK ANTONY

    Is it not strange, Canidius,
    That from Tarentum and Brundusium
    He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
    And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?

CLEOPATRA

    Celerity is never more admired
    Than by the negligent.

MARK ANTONY

    A good rebuke,
    Which might have well becomed the best of men,
    To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
    Will fight with him by sea.

CLEOPATRA

    By sea! what else?

CANIDIUS

    Why will my lord do so?

MARK ANTONY

    For that he dares us to't.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    So hath my lord dared him to single fight.

CANIDIUS

    Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.
    Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,
    Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;
    And so should you.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Your ships are not well mann'd;
    Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
    Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
    Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:
    Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace
    Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
    Being prepared for land.

MARK ANTONY

    By sea, by sea.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
    The absolute soldiership you have by land;
    Distract your army, which doth most consist
    Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
    Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
    The way which promises assurance; and
    Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,
    From firm security.

MARK ANTONY

    I'll fight at sea.

CLEOPATRA

    I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.

MARK ANTONY

    Our overplus of shipping will we burn;
    And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium
    Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
    We then can do't at land.

    Enter a Messenger
    Thy business?

Messenger

    The news is true, my lord; he is descried;
    Caesar has taken Toryne.

MARK ANTONY

    Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;
    Strange that power should be. Canidius,
    Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
    And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:
    Away, my Thetis!

    Enter a Soldier
    How now, worthy soldier?

Soldier

    O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;
    Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt
    This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
    And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
    Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
    And fighting foot to foot.

MARK ANTONY

    Well, well: away!

    Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

Soldier

    By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.

CANIDIUS

    Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
    Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,
    And we are women's men.

Soldier

    You keep by land
    The legions and the horse whole, do you not?

CANIDIUS

    Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
    Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:
    But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
    Carries beyond belief.

Soldier

    While he was yet in Rome,
    His power went out in such distractions as
    Beguiled all spies.

CANIDIUS

    Who's his lieutenant, hear you?

Soldier

    They say, one Taurus.

CANIDIUS

    Well I know the man.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    The emperor calls Canidius.

CANIDIUS

    With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,
    Each minute, some.

    Exeunt

SCENE VIII. A plain near Actium.

    Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and TAURUS, with his army, marching

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Taurus!

TAURUS

    My lord?

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle,
    Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed
    The prescript of this scroll: our fortune lies
    Upon this jump.

    Exeunt

SCENE IX. Another part of the plain.

    Enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

MARK ANTONY

    Set we our squadrons on yond side o' the hill,
    In eye of Caesar's battle; from which place
    We may the number of the ships behold,
    And so proceed accordingly.

    Exeunt

SCENE X. Another part of the plain.

    CANIDIUS marcheth with his land army one way over the stage; and TAURUS, the lieutenant of OCTAVIUS CAESAR, the other way. After their going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight

    Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:
    The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
    With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:
    To see't mine eyes are blasted.

    Enter SCARUS

SCARUS

    Gods and goddesses,
    All the whole synod of them!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    What's thy passion!

SCARUS

    The greater cantle of the world is lost
    With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
    Kingdoms and provinces.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    How appears the fight?

SCARUS

    On our side like the token'd pestilence,
    Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--
    Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,
    When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
    Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
    The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
    Hoists sails and flies.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    That I beheld:
    Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
    Endure a further view.

SCARUS

    She once being loof'd,
    The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
    Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
    Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
    I never saw an action of such shame;
    Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
    Did violate so itself.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Alack, alack!

    Enter CANIDIUS

CANIDIUS

    Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
    And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
    Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:
    O, he has given example for our flight,
    Most grossly, by his own!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Ay, are you thereabouts?
    Why, then, good night indeed.

CANIDIUS

    Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.

SCARUS

    'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
    What further comes.

CANIDIUS

    To Caesar will I render
    My legions and my horse: six kings already
    Show me the way of yielding.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    I'll yet follow
    The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
    Sits in the wind against me.

    Exeunt

SCENE XI. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

    Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants

MARK ANTONY

    Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
    It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:
    I am so lated in the world, that I
    Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship
    Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,
    And make your peace with Caesar.

All

    Fly! not we.

MARK ANTONY

    I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards
    To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
    I have myself resolved upon a course
    Which has no need of you; be gone:
    My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
    I follow'd that I blush to look upon:
    My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
    Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
    For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall
    Have letters from me to some friends that will
    Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
    Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
    Which my despair proclaims; let that be left
    Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:
    I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
    Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
    Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,
    Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.

    Sits down

    Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS following

EROS

    Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.

IRAS

    Do, most dear queen.

CHARMIAN

    Do! why: what else?

CLEOPATRA

    Let me sit down. O Juno!

MARK ANTONY

    No, no, no, no, no.

EROS

    See you here, sir?

MARK ANTONY

    O fie, fie, fie!

CHARMIAN

    Madam!

IRAS

    Madam, O good empress!

EROS

    Sir, sir,--

MARK ANTONY

    Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
    His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck
    The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
    That the mad Brutus ended: he alone
    Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had
    In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.

CLEOPATRA

    Ah, stand by.

EROS

    The queen, my lord, the queen.

IRAS

    Go to him, madam, speak to him:
    He is unqualitied with very shame.

CLEOPATRA

    Well then, sustain him: O!

EROS

    Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:
    Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
    Your comfort makes the rescue.

MARK ANTONY

    I have offended reputation,
    A most unnoble swerving.

EROS

    Sir, the queen.

MARK ANTONY

    O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,
    How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
    By looking back what I have left behind
    'Stroy'd in dishonour.

CLEOPATRA

    O my lord, my lord,
    Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
    You would have follow'd.

MARK ANTONY

    Egypt, thou knew'st too well
    My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,
    And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit
    Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
    Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
    Command me.

CLEOPATRA

    O, my pardon!

MARK ANTONY

    Now I must
    To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
    And palter in the shifts of lowness; who
    With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,
    Making and marring fortunes. You did know
    How much you were my conqueror; and that
    My sword, made weak by my affection, would
    Obey it on all cause.

CLEOPATRA

    Pardon, pardon!

MARK ANTONY

    Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
    All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;
    Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;
    Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.
    Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
    We scorn her most when most she offers blows.

    Exeunt

SCENE XII. Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

    Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Let him appear that's come from Antony.
    Know you him?

DOLABELLA

    Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
    An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
    He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,
    Which had superfluous kings for messengers
    Not many moons gone by.

    Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Approach, and speak.

EUPHRONIUS

    Such as I am, I come from Antony:
    I was of late as petty to his ends
    As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
    To his grand sea.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Be't so: declare thine office.

EUPHRONIUS

    Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
    Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,
    He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
    To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
    A private man in Athens: this for him.
    Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;
    Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
    The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
    Now hazarded to thy grace.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    For Antony,
    I have no ears to his request. The queen
    Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
    From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
    Or take his life there: this if she perform,
    She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.

EUPHRONIUS

    Fortune pursue thee!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Bring him through the bands.

    Exit EUPHRONIUS

    To THYREUS
    From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,
    And in our name, what she requires; add more,
    From thine invention, offers: women are not
    In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
    The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;
    Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
    Will answer as a law.

THYREUS

    Caesar, I go.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
    And what thou think'st his very action speaks
    In every power that moves.

THYREUS

    Caesar, I shall.

    Exeunt

SCENE XIII. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

    Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS

CLEOPATRA

    What shall we do, Enobarbus?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Think, and die.

CLEOPATRA

    Is Antony or we in fault for this?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Antony only, that would make his will
    Lord of his reason. What though you fled
    From that great face of war, whose several ranges
    Frighted each other? why should he follow?
    The itch of his affection should not then
    Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
    When half to half the world opposed, he being
    The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
    Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
    And leave his navy gazing.

CLEOPATRA

    Prithee, peace.

    Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador

MARK ANTONY

    Is that his answer?

EUPHRONIUS

    Ay, my lord.

MARK ANTONY

    The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
    Will yield us up.

EUPHRONIUS

    He says so.

MARK ANTONY

    Let her know't.
    To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
    And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
    With principalities.

CLEOPATRA

    That head, my lord?

MARK ANTONY

    To him again: tell him he wears the rose
    Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
    Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,
    May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail
    Under the service of a child as soon
    As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore
    To lay his gay comparisons apart,
    And answer me declined, sword against sword,
    Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.

    Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    [Aside] Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will
    Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,
    Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
    A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
    Do draw the inward quality after them,
    To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
    Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
    Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued
    His judgment too.

    Enter an Attendant

Attendant

    A messenger from CAESAR.

CLEOPATRA

    What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
    Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
    That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.

    Exit Attendant

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    [Aside] Mine honesty and I begin to square.
    The loyalty well held to fools does make
    Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure
    To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
    Does conquer him that did his master conquer
    And earns a place i' the story.

    Enter THYREUS

CLEOPATRA

    Caesar's will?

THYREUS

    Hear it apart.

CLEOPATRA

    None but friends: say boldly.

THYREUS

    So, haply, are they friends to Antony.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
    Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
    Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,
    Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.

THYREUS

    So.
    Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,
    Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,
    Further than he is Caesar.

CLEOPATRA

    Go on: right royal.

THYREUS

    He knows that you embrace not Antony
    As you did love, but as you fear'd him.

CLEOPATRA

    O!

THYREUS

    The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
    Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
    Not as deserved.

CLEOPATRA

    He is a god, and knows
    What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,
    But conquer'd merely.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    [Aside] To be sure of that,
    I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,
    That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
    Thy dearest quit thee.

    Exit

THYREUS

    Shall I say to Caesar
    What you require of him? for he partly begs
    To be desired to give. It much would please him,
    That of his fortunes you should make a staff
    To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,
    To hear from me you had left Antony,
    And put yourself under his shrowd,
    The universal landlord.

CLEOPATRA

    What's your name?

THYREUS

    My name is Thyreus.

CLEOPATRA

    Most kind messenger,
    Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
    I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt
    To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:
    Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
    The doom of Egypt.

THYREUS

    'Tis your noblest course.
    Wisdom and fortune combating together,
    If that the former dare but what it can,
    No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
    My duty on your hand.

CLEOPATRA

    Your Caesar's father oft,
    When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,
    Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
    As it rain'd kisses.

    Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

MARK ANTONY

    Favours, by Jove that thunders!
    What art thou, fellow?

THYREUS

    One that but performs
    The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
    To have command obey'd.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    [Aside] You will be whipp'd.

MARK ANTONY

    Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods
    and devils!
    Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
    Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
    And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
    Antony yet.

    Enter Attendants
    Take hence this Jack, and whip him.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    [Aside] 'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
    Than with an old one dying.

MARK ANTONY

    Moon and stars!
    Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
    That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
    So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,
    Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
    Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,
    And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.

THYREUS

    Mark Antony!

MARK ANTONY

    Tug him away: being whipp'd,
    Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall
    Bear us an errand to him.

    Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS
    You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
    Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
    Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
    And by a gem of women, to be abused
    By one that looks on feeders?

CLEOPATRA

    Good my lord,--

MARK ANTONY

    You have been a boggler ever:
    But when we in our viciousness grow hard--
    O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;
    In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us
    Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut
    To our confusion.

CLEOPATRA

    O, is't come to this?

MARK ANTONY

    I found you as a morsel cold upon
    Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment
    Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,
    Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
    Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,
    Though you can guess what temperance should be,
    You know not what it is.

CLEOPATRA

    Wherefore is this?

MARK ANTONY

    To let a fellow that will take rewards
    And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
    My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal
    And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were
    Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
    The horned herd! for I have savage cause;
    And to proclaim it civilly, were like
    A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
    For being yare about him.

    Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS
    Is he whipp'd?

First Attendant

    Soundly, my lord.

MARK ANTONY

    Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?

First Attendant

    He did ask favour.

MARK ANTONY

    If that thy father live, let him repent
    Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
    To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
    Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth
    The white hand of a lady fever thee,
    Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,
    Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say
    He makes me angry with him; for he seems
    Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
    Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;
    And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
    When my good stars, that were my former guides,
    Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
    Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
    My speech and what is done, tell him he has
    Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
    He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
    As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:
    Hence with thy stripes, begone!

    Exit THYREUS

CLEOPATRA

    Have you done yet?

MARK ANTONY

    Alack, our terrene moon
    Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone
    The fall of Antony!

CLEOPATRA

    I must stay his time.

MARK ANTONY

    To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
    With one that ties his points?

CLEOPATRA

    Not know me yet?

MARK ANTONY

    Cold-hearted toward me?

CLEOPATRA

    Ah, dear, if I be so,
    From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
    And poison it in the source; and the first stone
    Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
    Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
    Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
    Together with my brave Egyptians all,
    By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
    Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
    Have buried them for prey!

MARK ANTONY

    I am satisfied.
    Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where
    I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
    Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too
    Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.
    Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
    If from the field I shall return once more
    To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;
    I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
    There's hope in't yet.

CLEOPATRA

    That's my brave lord!

MARK ANTONY

    I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,
    And fight maliciously: for when mine hours
    Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
    Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
    And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
    Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
    All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
    Let's mock the midnight bell.

CLEOPATRA

    It is my birth-day:
    I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord
    Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.

MARK ANTONY

    We will yet do well.

CLEOPATRA

    Call all his noble captains to my lord.

MARK ANTONY

    Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
    The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;
    There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,
    I'll make death love me; for I will contend
    Even with his pestilent scythe.

    Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,
    Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood
    The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
    A diminution in our captain's brain
    Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,
    It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
    Some way to leave him.

    Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. Before Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

    Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with his Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power
    To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
    He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
    Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know
    I have many other ways to die; meantime
    Laugh at his challenge.

MECAENAS

    Caesar must think,
    When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
    Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
    Make boot of his distraction: never anger
    Made good guard for itself.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Let our best heads
    Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles
    We mean to fight: within our files there are,
    Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
    Enough to fetch him in. See it done:
    And feast the army; we have store to do't,
    And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.

    Enter MARK ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, with others

MARK ANTONY

    He will not fight with me, Domitius.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    No.

MARK ANTONY

    Why should he not?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
    He is twenty men to one.

MARK ANTONY

    To-morrow, soldier,
    By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,
    Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
    Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'

MARK ANTONY

    Well said; come on.
    Call forth my household servants: let's to-night
    Be bounteous at our meal.

    Enter three or four Servitors
    Give me thy hand,
    Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;--
    Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well,
    And kings have been your fellows.

CLEOPATRA

    [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What means this?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    [Aside to CLEOPATRA] 'Tis one of those odd
    tricks which sorrow shoots
    Out of the mind.

MARK ANTONY

    And thou art honest too.
    I wish I could be made so many men,
    And all of you clapp'd up together in
    An Antony, that I might do you service
    So good as you have done.

All

    The gods forbid!

MARK ANTONY

    Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:
    Scant not my cups; and make as much of me
    As when mine empire was your fellow too,
    And suffer'd my command.

CLEOPATRA

    [Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What does he mean?

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    [Aside to CLEOPATRA] To make his followers weep.

MARK ANTONY

    Tend me to-night;
    May be it is the period of your duty:
    Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
    A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
    You'll serve another master. I look on you
    As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
    I turn you not away; but, like a master
    Married to your good service, stay till death:
    Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
    And the gods yield you for't!

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    What mean you, sir,
    To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
    And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,
    Transform us not to women.

MARK ANTONY

    Ho, ho, ho!
    Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
    Grace grow where those drops fall!
    My hearty friends,
    You take me in too dolorous a sense;
    For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you
    To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,
    I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
    Where rather I'll expect victorious life
    Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
    And drown consideration.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. Before the palace.

    Enter two Soldiers to their guard

First Soldier

    Brother, good night: to-morrow is the day.

Second Soldier

    It will determine one way: fare you well.
    Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?

First Soldier

    Nothing. What news?

Second Soldier

    Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.

First Soldier

    Well, sir, good night.

    Enter two other Soldiers

Second Soldier

    Soldiers, have careful watch.

Third Soldier

    And you. Good night, good night.

    They place themselves in every corner of the stage

Fourth Soldier

    Here we: and if to-morrow
    Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
    Our landmen will stand up.

Third Soldier

    'Tis a brave army,
    And full of purpose.

    Music of the hautboys as under the stage

Fourth Soldier

    Peace! what noise?

First Soldier

    List, list!

Second Soldier

    Hark!

First Soldier

    Music i' the air.

Third Soldier

    Under the earth.

Fourth Soldier

    It signs well, does it not?

Third Soldier

    No.

First Soldier

    Peace, I say!
    What should this mean?

Second Soldier

    'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
    Now leaves him.

First Soldier

    Walk; let's see if other watchmen
    Do hear what we do?

    They advance to another post

Second Soldier

    How now, masters!

All

    [Speaking together] How now!
    How now! do you hear this?

First Soldier

    Ay; is't not strange?

Third Soldier

    Do you hear, masters? do you hear?

First Soldier

    Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;
    Let's see how it will give off.

All

    Content. 'Tis strange.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. A room in the palace.

    Enter MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and others attending

MARK ANTONY

    Eros! mine armour, Eros!

CLEOPATRA

    Sleep a little.

MARK ANTONY

    No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!

    Enter EROS with armour
    Come good fellow, put mine iron on:
    If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
    Because we brave her: come.

CLEOPATRA

    Nay, I'll help too.
    What's this for?

MARK ANTONY

    Ah, let be, let be! thou art
    The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.

CLEOPATRA

    Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.

MARK ANTONY

    Well, well;
    We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
    Go put on thy defences.

EROS

    Briefly, sir.

CLEOPATRA

    Is not this buckled well?

MARK ANTONY

    Rarely, rarely:
    He that unbuckles this, till we do please
    To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
    Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
    More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,
    That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
    The royal occupation! thou shouldst see
    A workman in't.

    Enter an armed Soldier
    Good morrow to thee; welcome:
    Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
    To business that we love we rise betime,
    And go to't with delight.

Soldier

    A thousand, sir,
    Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
    And at the port expect you.

    Shout. Trumpets flourish

    Enter Captains and Soldiers

Captain

    The morn is fair. Good morrow, general.

All

    Good morrow, general.

MARK ANTONY

    'Tis well blown, lads:
    This morning, like the spirit of a youth
    That means to be of note, begins betimes.
    So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.
    Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:
    This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable

    Kisses her
    And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand
    On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
    Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,
    Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.

    Exeunt MARK ANTONY, EROS, Captains, and Soldiers

CHARMIAN

    Please you, retire to your chamber.

CLEOPATRA

    Lead me.
    He goes forth gallantly. That he and Caesar might
    Determine this great war in single fight!
    Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Alexandria. MARK ANTONY's camp.

    Trumpets sound. Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS; a Soldier meeting them

Soldier

    The gods make this a happy day to Antony!

MARK ANTONY

    Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
    To make me fight at land!

Soldier

    Hadst thou done so,
    The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
    That has this morning left thee, would have still
    Follow'd thy heels.

MARK ANTONY

    Who's gone this morning?

Soldier

    Who!
    One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
    He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
    Say 'I am none of thine.'

MARK ANTONY

    What say'st thou?

Soldier

    Sir,
    He is with Caesar.

EROS

    Sir, his chests and treasure
    He has not with him.

MARK ANTONY

    Is he gone?

Soldier

    Most certain.

MARK ANTONY

    Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
    Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--
    I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;
    Say that I wish he never find more cause
    To change a master. O, my fortunes have
    Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

    Flourish. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, with DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, and others

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Go forth, Agrippa, and begin the fight:
    Our will is Antony be took alive;
    Make it so known.

AGRIPPA

    Caesar, I shall.

    Exit

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    The time of universal peace is near:
    Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world
    Shall bear the olive freely.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    Antony
    Is come into the field.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Go charge Agrippa
    Plant those that have revolted in the van,
    That Antony may seem to spend his fury
    Upon himself.

    Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on
    Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
    Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
    And leave his master Antony: for this pains
    Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
    That fell away have entertainment, but
    No honourable trust. I have done ill;
    Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,
    That I will joy no more.

    Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's

Soldier

    Enobarbus, Antony
    Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
    His bounty overplus: the messenger
    Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
    Unloading of his mules.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    I give it you.

Soldier

    Mock not, Enobarbus.
    I tell you true: best you safed the bringer
    Out of the host; I must attend mine office,
    Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
    Continues still a Jove.

    Exit

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    I am alone the villain of the earth,
    And feel I am so most. O Antony,
    Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
    My better service, when my turpitude
    Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
    If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
    Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
    I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
    Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
    My latter part of life.

    Exit

SCENE VII. Field of battle between the camps.

    Alarum. Drums and trumpets. Enter AGRIPPA and others

AGRIPPA

    Retire, we have engaged ourselves too far:
    Caesar himself has work, and our oppression
    Exceeds what we expected.

    Exeunt

    Alarums. Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS wounded

SCARUS

    O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
    Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
    With clouts about their heads.

MARK ANTONY

    Thou bleed'st apace.

SCARUS

    I had a wound here that was like a T,
    But now 'tis made an H.

MARK ANTONY

    They do retire.

SCARUS

    We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
    Room for six scotches more.

    Enter EROS

EROS

    They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
    For a fair victory.

SCARUS

    Let us score their backs,
    And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
    'Tis sport to maul a runner.

MARK ANTONY

    I will reward thee
    Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold
    For thy good valour. Come thee on.

SCARUS

    I'll halt after.

    Exeunt

SCENE VIII. Under the walls of Alexandria.

    Alarum. Enter MARK ANTONY, in a march; SCARUS, with others

MARK ANTONY

    We have beat him to his camp: run one before,
    And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
    Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood
    That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;
    For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
    Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been
    Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
    Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
    Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
    Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss
    The honour'd gashes whole.

    To SCARUS
    Give me thy hand

    Enter CLEOPATRA, attended
    To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
    Make her thanks bless thee.

    To CLEOPATRA
    O thou day o' the world,
    Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,
    Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
    Ride on the pants triumphing!

CLEOPATRA

    Lord of lords!
    O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from
    The world's great snare uncaught?

MARK ANTONY

    My nightingale,
    We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!
    though grey
    Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
    A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
    Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
    Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:
    Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
    As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
    Destroy'd in such a shape.

CLEOPATRA

    I'll give thee, friend,
    An armour all of gold; it was a king's.

MARK ANTONY

    He has deserved it, were it carbuncled
    Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
    Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
    Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
    Had our great palace the capacity
    To camp this host, we all would sup together,
    And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
    Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
    With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
    Make mingle with rattling tabourines;
    That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
    Applauding our approach.

    Exeunt

SCENE IX. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

    Sentinels at their post

First Soldier

    If we be not relieved within this hour,
    We must return to the court of guard: the night
    Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
    By the second hour i' the morn.

Second Soldier

    This last day was
    A shrewd one to's.

    Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    O, bear me witness, night,--

Third Soldier

    What man is this?

Second Soldier

    Stand close, and list him.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
    When men revolted shall upon record
    Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
    Before thy face repent!

First Soldier

    Enobarbus!

Third Soldier

    Peace!
    Hark further.

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS

    O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
    The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
    That life, a very rebel to my will,
    May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
    Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
    Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
    And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
    Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
    Forgive me in thine own particular;
    But let the world rank me in register
    A master-leaver and a fugitive:
    O Antony! O Antony!

    Dies

Second Soldier

    Let's speak To him.

First Soldier

    Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
    May concern Caesar.

Third Soldier

    Let's do so. But he sleeps.

First Soldier

    Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
    Was never yet for sleep.

Second Soldier

    Go we to him.

Third Soldier

    Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.

Second Soldier

    Hear you, sir?

First Soldier

    The hand of death hath raught him.

    Drums afar off
    Hark! the drums
    Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
    To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
    Is fully out.

Third Soldier

    Come on, then;
    He may recover yet.

    Exeunt with the body

SCENE X. Between the two camps.

    Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS, with their Army

MARK ANTONY

    Their preparation is to-day by sea;
    We please them not by land.

SCARUS

    For both, my lord.

MARK ANTONY

    I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;
    We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot
    Upon the hills adjoining to the city
    Shall stay with us: order for sea is given;
    They have put forth the haven
    Where their appointment we may best discover,
    And look on their endeavour.

    Exeunt

SCENE XI. Another part of the same.

    Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, and his Army

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    But being charged, we will be still by land,
    Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force
    Is forth to man his galleys. To the vales,
    And hold our best advantage.

    Exeunt

SCENE XII. Another part of the same.

    Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS

MARK ANTONY

    Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine
    does stand,
    I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word
    Straight, how 'tis like to go.

    Exit

SCARUS

    Swallows have built
    In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers
    Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
    And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
    Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,
    His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,
    Of what he has, and has not.

    Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight

    Re-enter MARK ANTONY

MARK ANTONY

    All is lost;
    This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:
    My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder
    They cast their caps up and carouse together
    Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!
    'tis thou
    Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
    Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
    For when I am revenged upon my charm,
    I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.

    Exit SCARUS
    O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:
    Fortune and Antony part here; even here
    Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
    That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
    Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
    On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,
    That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:
    O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--
    Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;
    Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--
    Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
    Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.
    What, Eros, Eros!

    Enter CLEOPATRA
    Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!

CLEOPATRA

    Why is my lord enraged against his love?

MARK ANTONY

    Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,
    And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,
    And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:
    Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
    Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
    For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let
    Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
    With her prepared nails.

    Exit CLEOPATRA
    'Tis well thou'rt gone,
    If it be well to live; but better 'twere
    Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
    Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
    The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,
    Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:
    Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;
    And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,
    Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:
    To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
    Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!

    Exit

SCENE XIII. Alexandria. Cleopatra's palace.

    Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN

CLEOPATRA

    Help me, my women! O, he is more mad
    Than Telamon for his shield; the boar of Thessaly
    Was never so emboss'd.

CHARMIAN

    To the monument!
    There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
    The soul and body rive not more in parting
    Than greatness going off.

CLEOPATRA

    To the monument!
    Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
    Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'
    And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,
    And bring me how he takes my death.
    To the monument!

    Exeunt

SCENE XIV. The same. Another room.

    Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS

MARK ANTONY

    Eros, thou yet behold'st me?

EROS

    Ay, noble lord.

MARK ANTONY

    Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;
    A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
    A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
    A forked mountain, or blue promontory
    With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,
    And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen
    these signs;
    They are black vesper's pageants.

EROS

    Ay, my lord,

MARK ANTONY

    That which is now a horse, even with a thought
    The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
    As water is in water.

EROS

    It does, my lord.

MARK ANTONY

    My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
    Even such a body: here I am Antony:
    Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
    I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--
    Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;
    Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
    A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has
    Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
    Unto an enemy's triumph.
    Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
    Ourselves to end ourselves.

    Enter MARDIAN
    O! thy vile lady!
    She has robb'd me of my sword.

MARDIAN

    No, Antony;
    My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled
    With thine entirely.

MARK ANTONY

    Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
    She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.

MARDIAN

    Death of one person can be paid but once,
    And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do
    Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
    Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
    Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
    The name of Antony; it was divided
    Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,
    Thy name so buried in her.

MARK ANTONY

    Dead, then?

MARDIAN

    Dead.

MARK ANTONY

    Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
    And we must sleep.

    To MARDIAN
    That thou depart'st hence safe,
    Does pay thy labour richly; go.

    Exit MARDIAN
    Off, pluck off:
    The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
    The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
    Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
    Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
    No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;
    You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.

    Exit EROS
    I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
    Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
    All length is torture: since the torch is out,
    Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour
    Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
    Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.
    Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:
    Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
    And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:
    Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,
    And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!

    Re-enter EROS

EROS

    What would my lord?

MARK ANTONY

    Since Cleopatra died,
    I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods
    Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
    Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
    With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
    The courage of a woman; less noble mind
    Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
    'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
    That, when the exigent should come, which now
    Is come indeed, when I should see behind me
    The inevitable prosecution of
    Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
    Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:
    Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
    Put colour in thy cheek.

EROS

    The gods withhold me!
    Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
    Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?

MARK ANTONY

    Eros,
    Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
    Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
    His corrigible neck, his face subdued
    To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
    Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
    His baseness that ensued?

EROS

    I would not see't.

MARK ANTONY

    Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.
    Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
    Most useful for thy country.

EROS

    O, sir, pardon me!

MARK ANTONY

    When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then
    To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;
    Or thy precedent services are all
    But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.

EROS

    Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,
    Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.

MARK ANTONY

    Lo thee!

    Turning from him

EROS

    My sword is drawn.

MARK ANTONY

    Then let it do at once
    The thing why thou hast drawn it.

EROS

    My dear master,
    My captain, and my emperor, let me say,
    Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.

MARK ANTONY

    'Tis said, man; and farewell.

EROS

    Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?

MARK ANTONY

    Now, Eros.

EROS

    Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow
    Of Antony's death.

    Kills himself

MARK ANTONY

    Thrice-nobler than myself!
    Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
    I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
    Have by their brave instruction got upon me
    A nobleness in record: but I will be
    A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
    As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
    Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus

    Falling on his sword
    I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?
    The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!

    Enter DERCETAS and Guard

First Guard

    What's the noise?

MARK ANTONY

    I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end
    Of what I have begun.

Second Guard

    The star is fall'n.

First Guard

    And time is at his period.

All

    Alas, and woe!

MARK ANTONY

    Let him that loves me strike me dead.

First Guard

    Not I.

Second Guard

    Nor I.

Third Guard

    Nor any one.

    Exeunt Guard

DERCETAS

    Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
    This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
    Shall enter me with him.

    Enter DIOMEDES

DIOMEDES

    Where's Antony?

DERCETAS

    There, Diomed there.

DIOMEDES

    Lives he?
    Wilt thou not answer, man?

    Exit DERCETAS

MARK ANTONY

    Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me
    Sufficing strokes for death.

DIOMEDES

    Most absolute lord,
    My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.

MARK ANTONY

    When did she send thee?

DIOMEDES

    Now, my lord.

MARK ANTONY

    Where is she?

DIOMEDES

    Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
    Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
    Which never shall be found--you did suspect
    She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage
    Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;
    But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent
    Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
    I dread, too late.

MARK ANTONY

    Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.

DIOMEDES

    What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!
    Come, your lord calls!

    Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY

MARK ANTONY

    Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
    'Tis the last service that I shall command you.

First Guard

    Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
    All your true followers out.

All

    Most heavy day!

MARK ANTONY

    Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
    To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome
    Which comes to punish us, and we punish it
    Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:
    I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,
    And have my thanks for all.

    Exeunt, bearing MARK ANTONY

SCENE XV. The same. A monument.

    Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with CHARMIAN and IRAS

CLEOPATRA

    O Charmian, I will never go from hence.

CHARMIAN

    Be comforted, dear madam.

CLEOPATRA

    No, I will not:
    All strange and terrible events are welcome,
    But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
    Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
    As that which makes it.

    Enter, below, DIOMEDES
    How now! is he dead?

DIOMEDES

    His death's upon him, but not dead.
    Look out o' the other side your monument;
    His guard have brought him thither.

    Enter, below, MARK ANTONY, borne by the Guard

CLEOPATRA

    O sun,
    Burn the great sphere thou movest in!
    darkling stand
    The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,
    Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;
    Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.

MARK ANTONY

    Peace!
    Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
    But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.

CLEOPATRA

    So it should be, that none but Antony
    Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!

MARK ANTONY

    I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
    I here importune death awhile, until
    Of many thousand kisses the poor last
    I lay up thy lips.

CLEOPATRA

    I dare not, dear,--
    Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,
    Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
    Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
    Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,
    serpents, have
    Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
    Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
    And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
    Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--
    Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:
    Assist, good friends.

MARK ANTONY

    O, quick, or I am gone.

CLEOPATRA

    Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
    Our strength is all gone into heaviness,
    That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,
    The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
    And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--
    Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;

    They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA
    And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
    Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,
    Thus would I wear them out.

All

    A heavy sight!

MARK ANTONY

    I am dying, Egypt, dying:
    Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.

CLEOPATRA

    No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
    That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,
    Provoked by my offence.

MARK ANTONY

    One word, sweet queen:
    Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!

CLEOPATRA

    They do not go together.

MARK ANTONY

    Gentle, hear me:
    None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.

CLEOPATRA

    My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
    None about Caesar.

MARK ANTONY

    The miserable change now at my end
    Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
    In feeding them with those my former fortunes
    Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,
    The noblest; and do now not basely die,
    Not cowardly put off my helmet to
    My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman
    Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;
    I can no more.

CLEOPATRA

    Noblest of men, woo't die?
    Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
    In this dull world, which in thy absence is
    No better than a sty? O, see, my women,

    MARK ANTONY dies
    The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
    O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
    The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
    Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
    And there is nothing left remarkable
    Beneath the visiting moon.

    Faints

CHARMIAN

    O, quietness, lady!

IRAS

    She is dead too, our sovereign.

CHARMIAN

    Lady!

IRAS

    Madam!

CHARMIAN

    O madam, madam, madam!

IRAS

    Royal Egypt, Empress!

CHARMIAN

    Peace, peace, Iras!

CLEOPATRA

    No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded
    By such poor passion as the maid that milks
    And does the meanest chares. It were for me
    To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
    To tell them that this world did equal theirs
    Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;
    Patience is scottish, and impatience does
    Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
    To rush into the secret house of death,
    Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
    What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
    My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
    Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:
    We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,
    what's noble,
    Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
    And make death proud to take us. Come, away:
    This case of that huge spirit now is cold:
    Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend
    But resolution, and the briefest end.

    Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body

ACT V
SCENE I. Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.

    Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
    Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
    The pauses that he makes.

DOLABELLA

    Caesar, I shall.

    Exit

    Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest
    Appear thus to us?

DERCETAS

    I am call'd Dercetas;
    Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy
    Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,
    He was my master; and I wore my life
    To spend upon his haters. If thou please
    To take me to thee, as I was to him
    I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
    I yield thee up my life.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    What is't thou say'st?

DERCETAS

    I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    The breaking of so great a thing should make
    A greater crack: the round world
    Should have shook lions into civil streets,
    And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony
    Is not a single doom; in the name lay
    A moiety of the world.

DERCETAS

    He is dead, Caesar:
    Not by a public minister of justice,
    Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
    Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
    Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
    Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
    I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
    With his most noble blood.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Look you sad, friends?
    The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
    To wash the eyes of kings.

AGRIPPA

    And strange it is,
    That nature must compel us to lament
    Our most persisted deeds.

MECAENAS

    His taints and honours
    Waged equal with him.

AGRIPPA

    A rarer spirit never
    Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us
    Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.

MECAENAS

    When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
    He needs must see himself.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    O Antony!
    I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance
    Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
    Have shown to thee such a declining day,
    Or look on thine; we could not stall together
    In the whole world: but yet let me lament,
    With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
    That thou, my brother, my competitor
    In top of all design, my mate in empire,
    Friend and companion in the front of war,
    The arm of mine own body, and the heart
    Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,
    Unreconciliable, should divide
    Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--
    But I will tell you at some meeter season:

    Enter an Egyptian
    The business of this man looks out of him;
    We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?

Egyptian

    A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,
    Confined in all she has, her monument,
    Of thy intents desires instruction,
    That she preparedly may frame herself
    To the way she's forced to.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Bid her have good heart:
    She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
    How honourable and how kindly we
    Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live
    To be ungentle.

Egyptian

    So the gods preserve thee!

    Exit

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,
    We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts
    The quality of her passion shall require,
    Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
    She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
    Would be eternal in our triumph: go,
    And with your speediest bring us what she says,
    And how you find of her.

PROCULEIUS

    Caesar, I shall.

    Exit

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Gallus, go you along.

    Exit GALLUS
    Where's Dolabella,
    To second Proculeius?

All

    Dolabella!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Let him alone, for I remember now
    How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.
    Go with me to my tent; where you shall see
    How hardly I was drawn into this war;
    How calm and gentle I proceeded still
    In all my writings: go with me, and see
    What I can show in this.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Alexandria. A room in the monument.

    Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS

CLEOPATRA

    My desolation does begin to make
    A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;
    Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
    A minister of her will: and it is great
    To do that thing that ends all other deeds;
    Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
    Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
    The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.

    Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS, GALLUS and Soldiers

PROCULEIUS

    Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;
    And bids thee study on what fair demands
    Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.

CLEOPATRA

    What's thy name?

PROCULEIUS

    My name is Proculeius.

CLEOPATRA

    Antony
    Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
    I do not greatly care to be deceived,
    That have no use for trusting. If your master
    Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
    That majesty, to keep decorum, must
    No less beg than a kingdom: if he please
    To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
    He gives me so much of mine own, as I
    Will kneel to him with thanks.

PROCULEIUS

    Be of good cheer;
    You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:
    Make your full reference freely to my lord,
    Who is so full of grace, that it flows over
    On all that need: let me report to him
    Your sweet dependency; and you shall find
    A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,
    Where he for grace is kneel'd to.

CLEOPATRA

    Pray you, tell him
    I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him
    The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
    A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly
    Look him i' the face.

PROCULEIUS

    This I'll report, dear lady.
    Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
    Of him that caused it.

GALLUS

    You see how easily she may be surprised:

    Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the monument by a ladder placed against a window, and, having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of the Guard unbar and open the gates

    To PROCULEIUS and the Guard
    Guard her till Caesar come.

    Exit

IRAS

    Royal queen!

CHARMIAN

    O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:

CLEOPATRA

    Quick, quick, good hands.

    Drawing a dagger

PROCULEIUS

    Hold, worthy lady, hold:

    Seizes and disarms her
    Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
    Relieved, but not betray'd.

CLEOPATRA

    What, of death too,
    That rids our dogs of languish?

PROCULEIUS

    Cleopatra,
    Do not abuse my master's bounty by
    The undoing of yourself: let the world see
    His nobleness well acted, which your death
    Will never let come forth.

CLEOPATRA

    Where art thou, death?
    Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen
    Worthy many babes and beggars!

PROCULEIUS

    O, temperance, lady!

CLEOPATRA

    Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
    If idle talk will once be necessary,
    I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,
    Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
    Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;
    Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
    Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
    And show me to the shouting varletry
    Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
    Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
    Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies
    Blow me into abhorring! rather make
    My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
    And hang me up in chains!

PROCULEIUS

    You do extend
    These thoughts of horror further than you shall
    Find cause in Caesar.

    Enter DOLABELLA

DOLABELLA

    Proculeius,
    What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
    And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,
    I'll take her to my guard.

PROCULEIUS

    So, Dolabella,
    It shall content me best: be gentle to her.

    To CLEOPATRA
    To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
    If you'll employ me to him.

CLEOPATRA

    Say, I would die.

    Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers

DOLABELLA

    Most noble empress, you have heard of me?

CLEOPATRA

    I cannot tell.

DOLABELLA

    Assuredly you know me.

CLEOPATRA

    No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
    You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
    Is't not your trick?

DOLABELLA

    I understand not, madam.

CLEOPATRA

    I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
    O, such another sleep, that I might see
    But such another man!

DOLABELLA

    If it might please ye,--

CLEOPATRA

    His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck
    A sun and moon, which kept their course,
    and lighted
    The little O, the earth.

DOLABELLA

    Most sovereign creature,--

CLEOPATRA

    His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
    Crested the world: his voice was propertied
    As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
    But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
    He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
    There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
    That grew the more by reaping: his delights
    Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
    The element they lived in: in his livery
    Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
    As plates dropp'd from his pocket.

DOLABELLA

    Cleopatra!

CLEOPATRA

    Think you there was, or might be, such a man
    As this I dream'd of?

DOLABELLA

    Gentle madam, no.

CLEOPATRA

    You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
    But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
    It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
    To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine
    And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
    Condemning shadows quite.

DOLABELLA

    Hear me, good madam.
    Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
    As answering to the weight: would I might never
    O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,
    By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
    My very heart at root.

CLEOPATRA

    I thank you, sir,
    Know you what Caesar means to do with me?

DOLABELLA

    I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.

CLEOPATRA

    Nay, pray you, sir,--

DOLABELLA

    Though he be honourable,--

CLEOPATRA

    He'll lead me, then, in triumph?

DOLABELLA

    Madam, he will; I know't.

    Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there: Octavius Caesar!'

    Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Which is the Queen of Egypt?

DOLABELLA

    It is the emperor, madam.

    CLEOPATRA kneels

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Arise, you shall not kneel:
    I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.

CLEOPATRA

    Sir, the gods
    Will have it thus; my master and my lord
    I must obey.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Take to you no hard thoughts:
    The record of what injuries you did us,
    Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
    As things but done by chance.

CLEOPATRA

    Sole sir o' the world,
    I cannot project mine own cause so well
    To make it clear; but do confess I have
    Been laden with like frailties which before
    Have often shamed our sex.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Cleopatra, know,
    We will extenuate rather than enforce:
    If you apply yourself to our intents,
    Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
    A benefit in this change; but if you seek
    To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
    Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
    Of my good purposes, and put your children
    To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
    If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.

CLEOPATRA

    And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,
    Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
    Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.

CLEOPATRA

    This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
    I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;
    Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?

SELEUCUS

    Here, madam.

CLEOPATRA

    This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,
    Upon his peril, that I have reserved
    To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.

SELEUCUS

    Madam,
    I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,
    Speak that which is not.

CLEOPATRA

    What have I kept back?

SELEUCUS

    Enough to purchase what you have made known.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
    Your wisdom in the deed.

CLEOPATRA

    See, Caesar! O, behold,
    How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
    And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
    The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
    Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust
    Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt
    Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,
    Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
    O rarely base!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Good queen, let us entreat you.

CLEOPATRA

    O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
    That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
    Doing the honour of thy lordliness
    To one so meek, that mine own servant should
    Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
    Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
    That I some lady trifles have reserved,
    Immoment toys, things of such dignity
    As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
    Some nobler token I have kept apart
    For Livia and Octavia, to induce
    Their mediation; must I be unfolded
    With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
    Beneath the fall I have.

    To SELEUCUS
    Prithee, go hence;
    Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
    Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,
    Thou wouldst have mercy on me.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Forbear, Seleucus.

    Exit SELEUCUS

CLEOPATRA

    Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought
    For things that others do; and, when we fall,
    We answer others' merits in our name,
    Are therefore to be pitied.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Cleopatra,
    Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,
    Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,
    Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
    Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
    Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
    Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
    For we intend so to dispose you as
    Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
    Our care and pity is so much upon you,
    That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.

CLEOPATRA

    My master, and my lord!

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Not so. Adieu.

    Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train

CLEOPATRA

    He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
    Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.

    Whispers CHARMIAN

IRAS

    Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
    And we are for the dark.

CLEOPATRA

    Hie thee again:
    I have spoke already, and it is provided;
    Go put it to the haste.

CHARMIAN

    Madam, I will.

    Re-enter DOLABELLA

DOLABELLA

    Where is the queen?

CHARMIAN

    Behold, sir.

    Exit

CLEOPATRA

    Dolabella!

DOLABELLA

    Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
    Which my love makes religion to obey,
    I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
    Intends his journey; and within three days
    You with your children will he send before:
    Make your best use of this: I have perform'd
    Your pleasure and my promise.

CLEOPATRA

    Dolabella,
    I shall remain your debtor.

DOLABELLA

    I your servant,
    Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.

CLEOPATRA

    Farewell, and thanks.

    Exit DOLABELLA
    Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
    Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown
    In Rome, as well as I mechanic slaves
    With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
    Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
    Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,
    And forced to drink their vapour.

IRAS

    The gods forbid!

CLEOPATRA

    Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors
    Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers
    Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians
    Extemporally will stage us, and present
    Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
    Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
    Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
    I' the posture of a whore.

IRAS

    O the good gods!

CLEOPATRA

    Nay, that's certain.

IRAS

    I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails
    Are stronger than mine eyes.

CLEOPATRA

    Why, that's the way
    To fool their preparation, and to conquer
    Their most absurd intents.

    Re-enter CHARMIAN
    Now, Charmian!
    Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
    My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,
    To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.
    Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
    And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
    To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
    Wherefore's this noise?

    Exit IRAS. A noise within

    Enter a Guardsman

Guard

    Here is a rural fellow
    That will not be denied your highness presence:
    He brings you figs.

CLEOPATRA

    Let him come in.

    Exit Guardsman
    What poor an instrument
    May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
    My resolution's placed, and I have nothing
    Of woman in me: now from head to foot
    I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
    No planet is of mine.

    Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket

Guard

    This is the man.

CLEOPATRA

    Avoid, and leave him.

    Exit Guardsman
    Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
    That kills and pains not?

Clown

    Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party
    that should desire you to touch him, for his biting
    is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or
    never recover.

CLEOPATRA

    Rememberest thou any that have died on't?

Clown

    Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of
    them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,
    but something given to lie; as a woman should not
    do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the
    biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
    a very good report o' the worm; but he that will
    believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
    half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
    worm's an odd worm.

CLEOPATRA

    Get thee hence; farewell.

Clown

    I wish you all joy of the worm.

    Setting down his basket

CLEOPATRA

    Farewell.

Clown

    You must think this, look you, that the worm will
    do his kind.

CLEOPATRA

    Ay, ay; farewell.

Clown

    Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the
    keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no
    goodness in worm.

CLEOPATRA

    Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.

Clown

    Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is
    not worth the feeding.

CLEOPATRA

    Will it eat me?

Clown

    You must not think I am so simple but I know the
    devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
    woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her
    not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
    gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
    that they make, the devils mar five.

CLEOPATRA

    Well, get thee gone; farewell.

Clown

    Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.

    Exit

    Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown, & c

CLEOPATRA

    Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
    Immortal longings in me: now no more
    The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:
    Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
    Antony call; I see him rouse himself
    To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
    The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
    To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
    Now to that name my courage prove my title!
    I am fire and air; my other elements
    I give to baser life. So; have you done?
    Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
    Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.

    Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies
    Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
    If thou and nature can so gently part,
    The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
    Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?
    If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
    It is not worth leave-taking.

CHARMIAN

    Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
    The gods themselves do weep!

CLEOPATRA

    This proves me base:
    If she first meet the curled Antony,
    He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
    Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou
    mortal wretch,

    To an asp, which she applies to her breast
    With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
    Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool
    Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
    That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
    Unpolicied!

CHARMIAN

    O eastern star!

CLEOPATRA

    Peace, peace!
    Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
    That sucks the nurse asleep?

CHARMIAN

    O, break! O, break!

CLEOPATRA

    As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--
    O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.

    Applying another asp to her arm
    What should I stay--

    Dies

CHARMIAN

    In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
    Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
    A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
    And golden Phoebus never be beheld
    Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
    I'll mend it, and then play.

    Enter the Guard, rushing in

First Guard

    Where is the queen?

CHARMIAN

    Speak softly, wake her not.

First Guard

    Caesar hath sent--

CHARMIAN

    Too slow a messenger.

    Applies an asp
    O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.

First Guard

    Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.

Second Guard

    There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.

First Guard

    What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?

CHARMIAN

    It is well done, and fitting for a princess
    Descended of so many royal kings.
    Ah, soldier!

    Dies

    Re-enter DOLABELLA

DOLABELLA

    How goes it here?

Second Guard

    All dead.

DOLABELLA

    Caesar, thy thoughts
    Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming
    To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
    So sought'st to hinder.

    Within 'A way there, a way for Caesar!'

    Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching

DOLABELLA

    O sir, you are too sure an augurer;
    That you did fear is done.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Bravest at the last,
    She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
    Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
    I do not see them bleed.

DOLABELLA

    Who was last with them?

First Guard

    A simple countryman, that brought her figs:
    This was his basket.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Poison'd, then.

First Guard

    O Caesar,
    This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:
    I found her trimming up the diadem
    On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood
    And on the sudden dropp'd.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    O noble weakness!
    If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear
    By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,
    As she would catch another Antony
    In her strong toil of grace.

DOLABELLA

    Here, on her breast,
    There is a vent of blood and something blown:
    The like is on her arm.

First Guard

    This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves
    Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
    Upon the caves of Nile.

OCTAVIUS CAESAR

    Most probable
    That so she died; for her physician tells me
    She hath pursued conclusions infinite
    Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
    And bear her women from the monument:
    She shall be buried by her Antony:
    No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
    A pair so famous. High events as these
    Strike those that make them; and their story is
    No less in pity than his glory which
    Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
    In solemn show attend this funeral;
    And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
    High order in this great solemnity.

    Exeunt


The Tragedy of Coriolanus

ACT I
SCENE I. Rome. A street.

    Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves, clubs, and other weapons

First Citizen

    Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.

All

    Speak, speak.

First Citizen

    You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?

All

    Resolved. resolved.

First Citizen

    First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.

All

    We know't, we know't.

First Citizen

    Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
    Is't a verdict?

All

    No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!

Second Citizen

    One word, good citizens.

First Citizen

    We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
    What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
    would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
    wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
    but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
    afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
    inventory to particularise their abundance; our
    sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
    our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
    speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.

Second Citizen

    Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?

All

    Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.

Second Citizen

    Consider you what services he has done for his country?

First Citizen

    Very well; and could be content to give him good
    report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.

Second Citizen

    Nay, but speak not maliciously.

First Citizen

    I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
    it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
    content to say it was for his country he did it to
    please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
    is, even till the altitude of his virtue.

Second Citizen

    What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
    vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.

First Citizen

    If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
    he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.

    Shouts within
    What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
    is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!

All

    Come, come.

First Citizen

    Soft! who comes here?

    Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA

Second Citizen

    Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
    the people.

First Citizen

    He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!

MENENIUS

    What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
    With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.

First Citizen

    Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
    had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
    which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
    suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
    have strong arms too.

MENENIUS

    Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
    Will you undo yourselves?

First Citizen

    We cannot, sir, we are undone already.

MENENIUS

    I tell you, friends, most charitable care
    Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
    Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
    Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
    Against the Roman state, whose course will on
    The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
    Of more strong link asunder than can ever
    Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
    The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
    Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
    You are transported by calamity
    Thither where more attends you, and you slander
    The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
    When you curse them as enemies.

First Citizen

    Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
    yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
    crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
    support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
    established against the rich, and provide more
    piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
    the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
    there's all the love they bear us.

MENENIUS

    Either you must
    Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
    Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
    A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
    But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
    To stale 't a little more.

First Citizen

    Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
    fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
    you, deliver.

MENENIUS

    There was a time when all the body's members
    Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
    That only like a gulf it did remain
    I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
    Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
    Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
    Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
    And, mutually participate, did minister
    Unto the appetite and affection common
    Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--

First Citizen

    Well, sir, what answer made the belly?

MENENIUS

    Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
    Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
    For, look you, I may make the belly smile
    As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
    To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
    That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
    As you malign our senators for that
    They are not such as you.

First Citizen

    Your belly's answer? What!
    The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
    The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
    Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
    With other muniments and petty helps
    In this our fabric, if that they--

MENENIUS

    What then?
    'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?

First Citizen

    Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
    Who is the sink o' the body,--

MENENIUS

    Well, what then?

First Citizen

    The former agents, if they did complain,
    What could the belly answer?

MENENIUS

    I will tell you
    If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
    Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.

First Citizen

    Ye're long about it.

MENENIUS

    Note me this, good friend;
    Your most grave belly was deliberate,
    Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
    'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
    'That I receive the general food at first,
    Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
    Because I am the store-house and the shop
    Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
    I send it through the rivers of your blood,
    Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
    And, through the cranks and offices of man,
    The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
    From me receive that natural competency
    Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
    You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--

First Citizen

    Ay, sir; well, well.

MENENIUS

    'Though all at once cannot
    See what I do deliver out to each,
    Yet I can make my audit up, that all
    From me do back receive the flour of all,
    And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?

First Citizen

    It was an answer: how apply you this?

MENENIUS

    The senators of Rome are this good belly,
    And you the mutinous members; for examine
    Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
    Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
    No public benefit which you receive
    But it proceeds or comes from them to you
    And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
    You, the great toe of this assembly?

First Citizen

    I the great toe! why the great toe?

MENENIUS

    For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
    Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
    Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
    Lead'st first to win some vantage.
    But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
    Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
    The one side must have bale.

    Enter CAIUS MARCIUS
    Hail, noble Marcius!

MARCIUS

    Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
    That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
    Make yourselves scabs?

First Citizen

    We have ever your good word.

MARCIUS

    He that will give good words to thee will flatter
    Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
    That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
    The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
    Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
    Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
    Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
    Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
    To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
    And curse that justice did it.
    Who deserves greatness
    Deserves your hate; and your affections are
    A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
    Which would increase his evil. He that depends
    Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
    And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
    With every minute you do change a mind,
    And call him noble that was now your hate,
    Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
    That in these several places of the city
    You cry against the noble senate, who,
    Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
    Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?

MENENIUS

    For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
    The city is well stored.

MARCIUS

    Hang 'em! They say!
    They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
    What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
    Who thrives and who declines; side factions
    and give out
    Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
    And feebling such as stand not in their liking
    Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
    grain enough!
    Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
    And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
    With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
    As I could pick my lance.

MENENIUS

    Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
    For though abundantly they lack discretion,
    Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
    What says the other troop?

MARCIUS

    They are dissolved: hang 'em!
    They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
    That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
    That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
    Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
    They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
    And a petition granted them, a strange one--
    To break the heart of generosity,
    And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
    As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
    Shouting their emulation.

MENENIUS

    What is granted them?

MARCIUS

    Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
    Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
    Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
    The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
    Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
    Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
    For insurrection's arguing.

MENENIUS

    This is strange.

MARCIUS

    Go, get you home, you fragments!

    Enter a Messenger, hastily

Messenger

    Where's Caius Marcius?

MARCIUS

    Here: what's the matter?

Messenger

    The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS

    I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
    Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.

    Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators; JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS

First Senator

    Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
    The Volsces are in arms.

MARCIUS

    They have a leader,
    Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
    I sin in envying his nobility,
    And were I any thing but what I am,
    I would wish me only he.

COMINIUS

    You have fought together.

MARCIUS

    Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
    Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
    Only my wars with him: he is a lion
    That I am proud to hunt.

First Senator

    Then, worthy Marcius,
    Attend upon Cominius to these wars.

COMINIUS

    It is your former promise.

MARCIUS

    Sir, it is;
    And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
    Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
    What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?

TITUS

    No, Caius Marcius;
    I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
    Ere stay behind this business.

MENENIUS

    O, true-bred!

First Senator

    Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
    Our greatest friends attend us.

TITUS

    [To COMINIUS] Lead you on.

    To MARCIUS
    Right worthy you priority.

COMINIUS

    Noble Marcius!

First Senator

    [To the Citizens] Hence to your homes; be gone!

MARCIUS

    Nay, let them follow:
    The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
    To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
    Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.

    Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS

SICINIUS

    Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?

BRUTUS

    He has no equal.

SICINIUS

    When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--

BRUTUS

    Mark'd you his lip and eyes?

SICINIUS

    Nay. but his taunts.

BRUTUS

    Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.

SICINIUS

    Be-mock the modest moon.

BRUTUS

    The present wars devour him: he is grown
    Too proud to be so valiant.

SICINIUS

    Such a nature,
    Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
    Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
    His insolence can brook to be commanded
    Under Cominius.

BRUTUS

    Fame, at the which he aims,
    In whom already he's well graced, can not
    Better be held nor more attain'd than by
    A place below the first: for what miscarries
    Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
    To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
    Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
    Had borne the business!'

SICINIUS

    Besides, if things go well,
    Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
    Of his demerits rob Cominius.

BRUTUS

    Come:
    Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
    Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
    To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
    In aught he merit not.

SICINIUS

    Let's hence, and hear
    How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
    More than his singularity, he goes
    Upon this present action.

BRUTUS

    Lets along.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Corioli. The Senate-house.

    Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS and certain Senators

First Senator

    So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
    That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
    And know how we proceed.

AUFIDIUS

    Is it not yours?
    What ever have been thought on in this state,
    That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
    Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
    Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
    I have the letter here; yes, here it is.

    Reads
    'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
    Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
    The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
    Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
    Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
    And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
    These three lead on this preparation
    Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
    Consider of it.'

First Senator

    Our army's in the field
    We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
    To answer us.

AUFIDIUS

    Nor did you think it folly
    To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
    They needs must show themselves; which
    in the hatching,
    It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
    We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
    To take in many towns ere almost Rome
    Should know we were afoot.

Second Senator

    Noble Aufidius,
    Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
    Let us alone to guard Corioli:
    If they set down before 's, for the remove
    Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
    They've not prepared for us.

AUFIDIUS

    O, doubt not that;
    I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
    Some parcels of their power are forth already,
    And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
    If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
    'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
    Till one can do no more.

All

    The gods assist you!

AUFIDIUS

    And keep your honours safe!

First Senator

    Farewell.

Second Senator

    Farewell.

All

    Farewell.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Rome. A room in Marcius' house.

    Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA they set them down on two low stools, and sew

VOLUMNIA

    I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
    more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
    should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
    won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
    he would show most love. When yet he was but
    tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
    youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
    for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
    sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
    how honour would become such a person. that it was
    no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
    renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
    danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
    war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
    bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
    more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
    than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
    man.

VIRGILIA

    But had he died in the business, madam; how then?

VOLUMNIA

    Then his good report should have been my son; I
    therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
    sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
    alike and none less dear than thine and my good
    Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
    country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.

    Enter a Gentlewoman

Gentlewoman

    Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.

VIRGILIA

    Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.

VOLUMNIA

    Indeed, you shall not.
    Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
    See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
    As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
    Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
    'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
    Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
    With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
    Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
    Or all or lose his hire.

VIRGILIA

    His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!

VOLUMNIA

    Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
    Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
    When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
    Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
    At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
    We are fit to bid her welcome.

    Exit Gentlewoman

VIRGILIA

    Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!

VOLUMNIA

    He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
    And tread upon his neck.

    Enter VALERIA, with an Usher and Gentlewoman

VALERIA

    My ladies both, good day to you.

VOLUMNIA

    Sweet madam.

VIRGILIA

    I am glad to see your ladyship.

VALERIA

    How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
    What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
    faith. How does your little son?

VIRGILIA

    I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.

VOLUMNIA

    He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
    look upon his school-master.

VALERIA

    O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
    very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
    Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
    confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
    butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
    again; and after it again; and over and over he
    comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
    fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
    teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
    it!

VOLUMNIA

    One on 's father's moods.

VALERIA

    Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.

VIRGILIA

    A crack, madam.

VALERIA

    Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play
    the idle husewife with me this afternoon.

VIRGILIA

    No, good madam; I will not out of doors.

VALERIA

    Not out of doors!

VOLUMNIA

    She shall, she shall.

VIRGILIA

    Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
    threshold till my lord return from the wars.

VALERIA

    Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
    you must go visit the good lady that lies in.

VIRGILIA

    I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
    my prayers; but I cannot go thither.

VOLUMNIA

    Why, I pray you?

VIRGILIA

    'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.

VALERIA

    You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
    the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
    Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
    were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
    pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.

VIRGILIA

    No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.

VALERIA

    In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
    excellent news of your husband.

VIRGILIA

    O, good madam, there can be none yet.

VALERIA

    Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
    him last night.

VIRGILIA

    Indeed, madam?

VALERIA

    In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
    Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
    whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
    our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
    down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
    prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
    on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.

VIRGILIA

    Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
    thing hereafter.

VOLUMNIA

    Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
    disease our better mirth.

VALERIA

    In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
    Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
    solemness out o' door. and go along with us.

VIRGILIA

    No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
    you much mirth.

VALERIA

    Well, then, farewell.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Before Corioli.

    Enter, with drum and colours, MARCIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, Captains and Soldiers. To them a Messenger

MARCIUS

    Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.

LARTIUS

    My horse to yours, no.

MARCIUS

    'Tis done.

LARTIUS

    Agreed.

MARCIUS

    Say, has our general met the enemy?

Messenger

    They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.

LARTIUS

    So, the good horse is mine.

MARCIUS

    I'll buy him of you.

LARTIUS

    No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
    For half a hundred years. Summon the town.

MARCIUS

    How far off lie these armies?

Messenger

    Within this mile and half.

MARCIUS

    Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
    Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
    That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
    To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.

    They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others on the walls
    Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?

First Senator

    No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
    That's lesser than a little.

    Drums afar off
    Hark! our drums
    Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
    Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
    Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
    They'll open of themselves.

    Alarum afar off
    Hark you. far off!
    There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
    Amongst your cloven army.

MARCIUS

    O, they are at it!

LARTIUS

    Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!

    Enter the army of the Volsces

MARCIUS

    They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
    Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
    With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
    brave Titus:
    They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
    Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
    He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
    And he shall feel mine edge.

    Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their trenches. Re-enter MARCIUS cursing

MARCIUS

    All the contagion of the south light on you,
    You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
    Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
    Further than seen and one infect another
    Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
    That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
    From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
    All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
    With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
    Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
    And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
    If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
    As they us to our trenches followed.

    Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS follows them to the gates
    So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
    'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
    Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.

    Enters the gates

First Soldier

    Fool-hardiness; not I.

Second Soldier

    Nor I.

    MARCIUS is shut in

First Soldier

    See, they have shut him in.

All

    To the pot, I warrant him.

    Alarum continues

    Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS

LARTIUS

    What is become of Marcius?

All

    Slain, sir, doubtless.

First Soldier

    Following the fliers at the very heels,
    With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
    Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
    To answer all the city.

LARTIUS

    O noble fellow!
    Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
    And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
    A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
    Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
    Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
    Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
    The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
    Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
    Were feverous and did tremble.

    Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy

First Soldier

    Look, sir.

LARTIUS

    O,'tis Marcius!
    Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.

    They fight, and all enter the city

SCENE V. Corioli. A street.

    Enter certain Romans, with spoils

First Roman

    This will I carry to Rome.

Second Roman

    And I this.

Third Roman

    A murrain on't! I took this for silver.

    Alarum continues still afar off

    Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS with a trumpet

MARCIUS

    See here these movers that do prize their hours
    At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
    Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
    Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
    Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
    And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
    There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
    Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
    Convenient numbers to make good the city;
    Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
    To help Cominius.

LARTIUS

    Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
    Thy exercise hath been too violent for
    A second course of fight.

MARCIUS

    Sir, praise me not;
    My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
    The blood I drop is rather physical
    Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
    I will appear, and fight.

LARTIUS

    Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
    Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
    Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
    Prosperity be thy page!

MARCIUS

    Thy friend no less
    Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.

LARTIUS

    Thou worthiest Marcius!

    Exit MARCIUS
    Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
    Call thither all the officers o' the town,
    Where they shall know our mind: away!

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Near the camp of Cominius.

    Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire, with soldiers

COMINIUS

    Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
    we are come off
    Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
    Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
    We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
    By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
    The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
    Lead their successes as we wish our own,
    That both our powers, with smiling
    fronts encountering,
    May give you thankful sacrifice.

    Enter a Messenger
    Thy news?

Messenger

    The citizens of Corioli have issued,
    And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
    I saw our party to their trenches driven,
    And then I came away.

COMINIUS

    Though thou speak'st truth,
    Methinks thou speak'st not well.
    How long is't since?

Messenger

    Above an hour, my lord.

COMINIUS

    'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
    How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
    And bring thy news so late?

Messenger

    Spies of the Volsces
    Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
    Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
    Half an hour since brought my report.

COMINIUS

    Who's yonder,
    That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
    He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
    Before-time seen him thus.

MARCIUS

    [Within] Come I too late?

COMINIUS

    The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
    More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
    From every meaner man.

    Enter MARCIUS

MARCIUS

    Come I too late?

COMINIUS

    Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
    But mantled in your own.

MARCIUS

    O, let me clip ye
    In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
    As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
    And tapers burn'd to bedward!

COMINIUS

    Flower of warriors,
    How is it with Titus Lartius?

MARCIUS

    As with a man busied about decrees:
    Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
    Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
    Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
    Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
    To let him slip at will.

COMINIUS

    Where is that slave
    Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
    Where is he? call him hither.

MARCIUS

    Let him alone;
    He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
    The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
    The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
    From rascals worse than they.

COMINIUS

    But how prevail'd you?

MARCIUS

    Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
    Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
    If not, why cease you till you are so?

COMINIUS

    Marcius,
    We have at disadvantage fought and did
    Retire to win our purpose.

MARCIUS

    How lies their battle? know you on which side
    They have placed their men of trust?

COMINIUS

    As I guess, Marcius,
    Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
    Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
    Their very heart of hope.

MARCIUS

    I do beseech you,
    By all the battles wherein we have fought,
    By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
    We have made to endure friends, that you directly
    Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
    And that you not delay the present, but,
    Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
    We prove this very hour.

COMINIUS

    Though I could wish
    You were conducted to a gentle bath
    And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
    Deny your asking: take your choice of those
    That best can aid your action.

MARCIUS

    Those are they
    That most are willing. If any such be here--
    As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
    Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
    Lesser his person than an ill report;
    If any think brave death outweighs bad life
    And that his country's dearer than himself;
    Let him alone, or so many so minded,
    Wave thus, to express his disposition,
    And follow Marcius.

    They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in their arms, and cast up their caps
    O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
    If these shows be not outward, which of you
    But is four Volsces? none of you but is
    Able to bear against the great Aufidius
    A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
    Though thanks to all, must I select
    from all: the rest
    Shall bear the business in some other fight,
    As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
    And four shall quickly draw out my command,
    Which men are best inclined.

COMINIUS

    March on, my fellows:
    Make good this ostentation, and you shall
    Divide in all with us.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. The gates of Corioli.

    TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon Corioli, going with drum and trumpet toward COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with Lieutenant, other Soldiers, and a Scout

LARTIUS

    So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
    As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
    Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
    For a short holding: if we lose the field,
    We cannot keep the town.

Lieutenant

    Fear not our care, sir.

LARTIUS

    Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
    Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.

    Exeunt

SCENE VIII. A field of battle.

    Alarum as in battle. Enter, from opposite sides, MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS

MARCIUS

    I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
    Worse than a promise-breaker.

AUFIDIUS

    We hate alike:
    Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
    More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.

MARCIUS

    Let the first budger die the other's slave,
    And the gods doom him after!

AUFIDIUS

    If I fly, Marcius,
    Holloa me like a hare.

MARCIUS

    Within these three hours, Tullus,
    Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
    And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
    Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
    Wrench up thy power to the highest.

AUFIDIUS

    Wert thou the Hector
    That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
    Thou shouldst not scape me here.

    They fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in breathless
    Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me
    In your condemned seconds.

    Exeunt

SCENE IX. The Roman camp.

    Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish. Enter, from one side, COMINIUS with the Romans; from the other side, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf

COMINIUS

    If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
    Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
    Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
    Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
    I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
    And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
    dull tribunes,
    That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
    Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
    Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
    Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
    Having fully dined before.

    Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power, from the pursuit

LARTIUS

    O general,
    Here is the steed, we the caparison:
    Hadst thou beheld--

MARCIUS

    Pray now, no more: my mother,
    Who has a charter to extol her blood,
    When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
    As you have done; that's what I can; induced
    As you have been; that's for my country:
    He that has but effected his good will
    Hath overta'en mine act.

COMINIUS

    You shall not be
    The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
    The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
    Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
    To hide your doings; and to silence that,
    Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
    Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
    In sign of what you are, not to reward
    What you have done--before our army hear me.

MARCIUS

    I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
    To hear themselves remember'd.

COMINIUS

    Should they not,
    Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
    And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
    Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
    The treasure in this field achieved and city,
    We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
    Before the common distribution, at
    Your only choice.

MARCIUS

    I thank you, general;
    But cannot make my heart consent to take
    A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
    And stand upon my common part with those
    That have beheld the doing.

    A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!' cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS stand bare

MARCIUS

    May these same instruments, which you profane,
    Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
    I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
    Made all of false-faced soothing!
    When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
    Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
    No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
    My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
    Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
    You shout me forth
    In acclamations hyperbolical;
    As if I loved my little should be dieted
    In praises sauced with lies.

COMINIUS

    Too modest are you;
    More cruel to your good report than grateful
    To us that give you truly: by your patience,
    If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
    Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
    Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
    As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
    Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
    My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
    With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
    For what he did before Corioli, call him,
    With all the applause and clamour of the host,
    CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
    The addition nobly ever!

    Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums

All

    Caius Marcius Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS

    I will go wash;
    And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
    Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
    I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
    To undercrest your good addition
    To the fairness of my power.

COMINIUS

    So, to our tent;
    Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
    To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
    Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
    The best, with whom we may articulate,
    For their own good and ours.

LARTIUS

    I shall, my lord.

CORIOLANUS

    The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
    Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
    Of my lord general.

COMINIUS

    Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?

CORIOLANUS

    I sometime lay here in Corioli
    At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
    He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
    But then Aufidius was with in my view,
    And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
    To give my poor host freedom.

COMINIUS

    O, well begg'd!
    Were he the butcher of my son, he should
    Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.

LARTIUS

    Marcius, his name?

CORIOLANUS

    By Jupiter! forgot.
    I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
    Have we no wine here?

COMINIUS

    Go we to our tent:
    The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
    It should be look'd to: come.

    Exeunt

SCENE X. The camp of the Volsces.

    A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, bloody, with two or three Soldiers

AUFIDIUS

    The town is ta'en!

First Soldier

    'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.

AUFIDIUS

    Condition!
    I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
    Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
    What good condition can a treaty find
    I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
    I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
    And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
    As often as we eat. By the elements,
    If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
    He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
    Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
    I thought to crush him in an equal force,
    True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
    Or wrath or craft may get him.

First Soldier

    He's the devil.

AUFIDIUS

    Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
    With only suffering stain by him; for him
    Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
    Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
    The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
    Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
    Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
    My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
    At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
    Against the hospitable canon, would I
    Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
    Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
    Be hostages for Rome.

First Soldier

    Will not you go?

AUFIDIUS

    I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
    'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
    How the world goes, that to the pace of it
    I may spur on my journey.

First Soldier

    I shall, sir.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Rome. A public place.

    Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people, SICINIUS and BRUTUS.

MENENIUS

    The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.

BRUTUS

    Good or bad?

MENENIUS

    Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
    love not Marcius.

SICINIUS

    Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.

MENENIUS

    Pray you, who does the wolf love?

SICINIUS

    The lamb.

MENENIUS

    Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
    noble Marcius.

BRUTUS

    He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.

MENENIUS

    He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
    are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.

Both

    Well, sir.

MENENIUS

    In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
    have not in abundance?

BRUTUS

    He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.

SICINIUS

    Especially in pride.

BRUTUS

    And topping all others in boasting.

MENENIUS

    This is strange now: do you two know how you are
    censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the
    right-hand file? do you?

Both

    Why, how are we censured?

MENENIUS

    Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?

Both

    Well, well, sir, well.

MENENIUS

    Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
    occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
    give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
    your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
    pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
    being proud?

BRUTUS

    We do it not alone, sir.

MENENIUS

    I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
    are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
    single: your abilities are too infant-like for
    doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
    could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
    and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
    O that you could!

BRUTUS

    What then, sir?

MENENIUS

    Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
    proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
    any in Rome.

SICINIUS

    Menenius, you are known well enough too.

MENENIUS

    I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
    loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
    Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
    favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
    upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
    with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
    of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
    malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
    you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
    you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
    crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
    delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
    compound with the major part of your syllables: and
    though I must be content to bear with those that say
    you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
    tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
    the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
    well enough too? what barm can your bisson
    conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
    known well enough too?

BRUTUS

    Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.

MENENIUS

    You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
    are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
    wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
    cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
    and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
    second day of audience. When you are hearing a
    matter between party and party, if you chance to be
    pinched with the colic, you make faces like
    mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
    patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
    dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
    by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
    cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
    a pair of strange ones.

BRUTUS

    Come, come, you are well understood to be a
    perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
    bencher in the Capitol.

MENENIUS

    Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
    encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
    you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
    wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
    so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
    cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
    saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
    who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
    since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
    best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
    your worships: more of your conversation would
    infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
    plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.

    BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside

    Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA
    How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
    were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
    your eyes so fast?

VOLUMNIA

    Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
    the love of Juno, let's go.

MENENIUS

    Ha! Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA

    Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
    approbation.

MENENIUS

    Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
    Marcius coming home!

VOLUMNIA VIRGILIA

    Nay,'tis true.

VOLUMNIA

    Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
    another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
    at home for you.

MENENIUS

    I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
    me!

VIRGILIA

    Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.

MENENIUS

    A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
    years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
    the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
    Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
    of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
    not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.

VIRGILIA

    O, no, no, no.

VOLUMNIA

    O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.

MENENIUS

    So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
    victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.

VOLUMNIA

    On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
    with the oaken garland.

MENENIUS

    Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?

VOLUMNIA

    Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
    Aufidius got off.

MENENIUS

    And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
    an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
    fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
    that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?

VOLUMNIA

    Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
    has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
    son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
    action outdone his former deeds doubly

VALERIA

    In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.

MENENIUS

    Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
    true purchasing.

VIRGILIA

    The gods grant them true!

VOLUMNIA

    True! pow, wow.

MENENIUS

    True! I'll be sworn they are true.
    Where is he wounded?

    To the Tribunes
    God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
    home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?

VOLUMNIA

    I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
    large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
    stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
    Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.

MENENIUS

    One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
    nine that I know.

VOLUMNIA

    He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
    wounds upon him.

MENENIUS

    Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.

    A shout and flourish
    Hark! the trumpets.

VOLUMNIA

    These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
    carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
    Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
    Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.

    A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS, crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and Soldiers, and a Herald

Herald

    Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
    Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
    With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
    In honour follows Coriolanus.
    Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

    Flourish

All

    Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!

CORIOLANUS

    No more of this; it does offend my heart:
    Pray now, no more.

COMINIUS

    Look, sir, your mother!

CORIOLANUS

    O,
    You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
    For my prosperity!

    Kneels

VOLUMNIA

    Nay, my good soldier, up;
    My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
    By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
    What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
    But O, thy wife!

CORIOLANUS

    My gracious silence, hail!
    Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
    That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
    Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
    And mothers that lack sons.

MENENIUS

    Now, the gods crown thee!

CORIOLANUS

    And live you yet?

    To VALERIA
    O my sweet lady, pardon.

VOLUMNIA

    I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
    And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.

MENENIUS

    A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
    And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
    A curse begin at very root on's heart,
    That is not glad to see thee! You are three
    That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
    We have some old crab-trees here
    at home that will not
    Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
    We call a nettle but a nettle and
    The faults of fools but folly.

COMINIUS

    Ever right.

CORIOLANUS

    Menenius ever, ever.

Herald

    Give way there, and go on!

CORIOLANUS

    [To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA] Your hand, and yours:
    Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
    The good patricians must be visited;
    From whom I have received not only greetings,
    But with them change of honours.

VOLUMNIA

    I have lived
    To see inherited my very wishes
    And the buildings of my fancy: only
    There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
    Our Rome will cast upon thee.

CORIOLANUS

    Know, good mother,
    I had rather be their servant in my way,
    Than sway with them in theirs.

COMINIUS

    On, to the Capitol!

    Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before. BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward

BRUTUS

    All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
    Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
    Into a rapture lets her baby cry
    While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
    Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
    Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
    Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
    With variable complexions, all agreeing
    In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
    Do press among the popular throngs and puff
    To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
    Commit the war of white and damask in
    Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
    Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
    As if that whatsoever god who leads him
    Were slily crept into his human powers
    And gave him graceful posture.

SICINIUS

    On the sudden,
    I warrant him consul.

BRUTUS

    Then our office may,
    During his power, go sleep.

SICINIUS

    He cannot temperately transport his honours
    From where he should begin and end, but will
    Lose those he hath won.

BRUTUS

    In that there's comfort.

SICINIUS

    Doubt not
    The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
    Upon their ancient malice will forget
    With the least cause these his new honours, which
    That he will give them make I as little question
    As he is proud to do't.

BRUTUS

    I heard him swear,
    Were he to stand for consul, never would he
    Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
    The napless vesture of humility;
    Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
    To the people, beg their stinking breaths.

SICINIUS

    'Tis right.

BRUTUS

    It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
    Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
    And the desire of the nobles.

SICINIUS

    I wish no better
    Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
    In execution.

BRUTUS

    'Tis most like he will.

SICINIUS

    It shall be to him then as our good wills,
    A sure destruction.

BRUTUS

    So it must fall out
    To him or our authorities. For an end,
    We must suggest the people in what hatred
    He still hath held them; that to's power he would
    Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
    Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
    In human action and capacity,
    Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
    Than camels in the war, who have their provand
    Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
    For sinking under them.

SICINIUS

    This, as you say, suggested
    At some time when his soaring insolence
    Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
    If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
    As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
    To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
    Shall darken him for ever.

    Enter a Messenger

BRUTUS

    What's the matter?

Messenger

    You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
    That Marcius shall be consul:
    I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
    The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
    Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
    Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
    As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
    A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
    I never saw the like.

BRUTUS

    Let's to the Capitol;
    And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
    But hearts for the event.

SICINIUS

    Have with you.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. The Capitol.

    Enter two Officers, to lay cushions

First Officer

    Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
    for consulships?

Second Officer

    Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
    Coriolanus will carry it.

First Officer

    That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
    loves not the common people.

Second Officer

    Faith, there had been many great men that have
    flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
    be many that they have loved, they know not
    wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
    they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
    Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
    him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
    disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
    them plainly see't.

First Officer

    If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
    he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
    good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
    devotion than can render it him; and leaves
    nothing undone that may fully discover him their
    opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
    displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
    dislikes, to flatter them for their love.

Second Officer

    He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
    ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
    having been supple and courteous to the people,
    bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
    an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
    planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
    in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
    silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
    ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
    malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
    reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.

First Officer

    No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
    are coming.

    A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators, SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their places; the Tribunes take their Places by themselves. CORIOLANUS stands

MENENIUS

    Having determined of the Volsces and
    To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
    As the main point of this our after-meeting,
    To gratify his noble service that
    Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
    please you,
    Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
    The present consul, and last general
    In our well-found successes, to report
    A little of that worthy work perform'd
    By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
    We met here both to thank and to remember
    With honours like himself.

First Senator

    Speak, good Cominius:
    Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
    Rather our state's defective for requital
    Than we to stretch it out.

    To the Tribunes
    Masters o' the people,
    We do request your kindest ears, and after,
    Your loving motion toward the common body,
    To yield what passes here.

SICINIUS

    We are convented
    Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
    Inclinable to honour and advance
    The theme of our assembly.

BRUTUS

    Which the rather
    We shall be blest to do, if he remember
    A kinder value of the people than
    He hath hereto prized them at.

MENENIUS

    That's off, that's off;
    I would you rather had been silent. Please you
    To hear Cominius speak?

BRUTUS

    Most willingly;
    But yet my caution was more pertinent
    Than the rebuke you give it.

MENENIUS

    He loves your people
    But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
    Worthy Cominius, speak.

    CORIOLANUS offers to go away
    Nay, keep your place.

First Senator

    Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
    What you have nobly done.

CORIOLANUS

    Your horror's pardon:
    I had rather have my wounds to heal again
    Than hear say how I got them.

BRUTUS

    Sir, I hope
    My words disbench'd you not.

CORIOLANUS

    No, sir: yet oft,
    When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
    You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
    your people,
    I love them as they weigh.

MENENIUS

    Pray now, sit down.

CORIOLANUS

    I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
    When the alarum were struck than idly sit
    To hear my nothings monster'd.

    Exit

MENENIUS

    Masters of the people,
    Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
    That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
    He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
    Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.

COMINIUS

    I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
    Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
    That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
    Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
    The man I speak of cannot in the world
    Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
    When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
    Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
    Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
    When with his Amazonian chin he drove
    The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
    An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
    Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
    And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
    When he might act the woman in the scene,
    He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
    Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
    Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
    And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
    He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
    Before and in Corioli, let me say,
    I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
    And by his rare example made the coward
    Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
    A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
    And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
    Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
    He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
    Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
    The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
    With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
    And with a sudden reinforcement struck
    Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
    When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
    His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
    Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
    And to the battle came he; where he did
    Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
    'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
    Both field and city ours, he never stood
    To ease his breast with panting.

MENENIUS

    Worthy man!

First Senator

    He cannot but with measure fit the honours
    Which we devise him.

COMINIUS

    Our spoils he kick'd at,
    And look'd upon things precious as they were
    The common muck of the world: he covets less
    Than misery itself would give; rewards
    His deeds with doing them, and is content
    To spend the time to end it.

MENENIUS

    He's right noble:
    Let him be call'd for.

First Senator

    Call Coriolanus.

Officer

    He doth appear.

    Re-enter CORIOLANUS

MENENIUS

    The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
    To make thee consul.

CORIOLANUS

    I do owe them still
    My life and services.

MENENIUS

    It then remains
    That you do speak to the people.

CORIOLANUS

    I do beseech you,
    Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
    Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
    For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
    That I may pass this doing.

SICINIUS

    Sir, the people
    Must have their voices; neither will they bate
    One jot of ceremony.

MENENIUS

    Put them not to't:
    Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
    Take to you, as your predecessors have,
    Your honour with your form.

CORIOLANUS

    It is apart
    That I shall blush in acting, and might well
    Be taken from the people.

BRUTUS

    Mark you that?

CORIOLANUS

    To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
    Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
    As if I had received them for the hire
    Of their breath only!

MENENIUS

    Do not stand upon't.
    We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
    Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
    Wish we all joy and honour.

Senators

    To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!

    Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS and BRUTUS

BRUTUS

    You see how he intends to use the people.

SICINIUS

    May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
    As if he did contemn what he requested
    Should be in them to give.

BRUTUS

    Come, we'll inform them
    Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
    I know, they do attend us.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. The Forum.

    Enter seven or eight Citizens

First Citizen

    Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.

Second Citizen

    We may, sir, if we will.

Third Citizen

    We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
    power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
    his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
    tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
    he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
    our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
    monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
    were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
    which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
    monstrous members.

First Citizen

    And to make us no better thought of, a little help
    will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he
    himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.

Third Citizen

    We have been called so of many; not that our heads
    are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
    but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
    truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
    one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
    and their consent of one direct way should be at
    once to all the points o' the compass.

Second Citizen

    Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
    fly?

Third Citizen

    Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
    will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
    if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.

Second Citizen

    Why that way?

Third Citizen

    To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
    melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
    for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.

Second Citizen

    You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.

Third Citizen

    Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
    that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
    say, if he would incline to the people, there was
    never a worthier man.

    Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility, with MENENIUS
    Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
    behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
    come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
    by threes. He's to make his requests by
    particulars; wherein every one of us has a single
    honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
    tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
    you shall go by him.

All

    Content, content.

    Exeunt Citizens

MENENIUS

    O sir, you are not right: have you not known
    The worthiest men have done't?

CORIOLANUS

    What must I say?
    'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
    My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
    I got them in my country's service, when
    Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
    From the noise of our own drums.'

MENENIUS

    O me, the gods!
    You must not speak of that: you must desire them
    To think upon you.

CORIOLANUS

    Think upon me! hang 'em!
    I would they would forget me, like the virtues
    Which our divines lose by 'em.

MENENIUS

    You'll mar all:
    I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
    In wholesome manner.

    Exit

CORIOLANUS

    Bid them wash their faces
    And keep their teeth clean.

    Re-enter two of the Citizens
    So, here comes a brace.

    Re-enter a third Citizen
    You know the cause, air, of my standing here.

Third Citizen

    We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.

CORIOLANUS

    Mine own desert.

Second Citizen

    Your own desert!

CORIOLANUS

    Ay, but not mine own desire.

Third Citizen

    How not your own desire?

CORIOLANUS

    No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
    poor with begging.

Third Citizen

    You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
    gain by you.

CORIOLANUS

    Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?

First Citizen

    The price is to ask it kindly.

CORIOLANUS

    Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
    show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
    good voice, sir; what say you?

Second Citizen

    You shall ha' it, worthy sir.

CORIOLANUS

    A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
    begged. I have your alms: adieu.

Third Citizen

    But this is something odd.

Second Citizen

    An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.

    Exeunt the three Citizens

    Re-enter two other Citizens

CORIOLANUS

    Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
    voices that I may be consul, I have here the
    customary gown.

Fourth Citizen

    You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
    have not deserved nobly.

CORIOLANUS

    Your enigma?

Fourth Citizen

    You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
    been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
    the common people.

CORIOLANUS

    You should account me the more virtuous that I have
    not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
    sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
    estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
    gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
    rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
    the insinuating nod and be off to them most
    counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
    bewitchment of some popular man and give it
    bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
    I may be consul.

Fifth Citizen

    We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
    you our voices heartily.

Fourth Citizen

    You have received many wounds for your country.

CORIOLANUS

    I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
    will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.

Both Citizens

    The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!

    Exeunt

CORIOLANUS

    Most sweet voices!
    Better it is to die, better to starve,
    Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
    Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
    To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
    Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
    What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
    The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
    And mountainous error be too highly heapt
    For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
    Let the high office and the honour go
    To one that would do thus. I am half through;
    The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.

    Re-enter three Citizens more
    Here come more voices.
    Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
    Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
    Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
    I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
    Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
    Indeed I would be consul.

Sixth Citizen

    He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
    man's voice.

Seventh Citizen

    Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
    and make him good friend to the people!

All Citizens

    Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!

    Exeunt

CORIOLANUS

    Worthy voices!

    Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS

MENENIUS

    You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
    Endue you with the people's voice: remains
    That, in the official marks invested, you
    Anon do meet the senate.

CORIOLANUS

    Is this done?

SICINIUS

    The custom of request you have discharged:
    The people do admit you, and are summon'd
    To meet anon, upon your approbation.

CORIOLANUS

    Where? at the senate-house?

SICINIUS

    There, Coriolanus.

CORIOLANUS

    May I change these garments?

SICINIUS

    You may, sir.

CORIOLANUS

    That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
    Repair to the senate-house.

MENENIUS

    I'll keep you company. Will you along?

BRUTUS

    We stay here for the people.

SICINIUS

    Fare you well.

    Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS
    He has it now, and by his looks methink
    'Tis warm at 's heart.

BRUTUS

    With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
    will you dismiss the people?

    Re-enter Citizens

SICINIUS

    How now, my masters! have you chose this man?

First Citizen

    He has our voices, sir.

BRUTUS

    We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.

Second Citizen

    Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
    He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.

Third Citizen

    Certainly
    He flouted us downright.

First Citizen

    No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.

Second Citizen

    Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
    He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
    His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.

SICINIUS

    Why, so he did, I am sure.

Citizens

    No, no; no man saw 'em.

Third Citizen

    He said he had wounds, which he could show
    in private;
    And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
    'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
    But by your voices, will not so permit me;
    Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
    Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
    Your most sweet voices: now you have left
    your voices,
    I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?

SICINIUS

    Why either were you ignorant to see't,
    Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
    To yield your voices?

BRUTUS

    Could you not have told him
    As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
    But was a petty servant to the state,
    He was your enemy, ever spake against
    Your liberties and the charters that you bear
    I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
    A place of potency and sway o' the state,
    If he should still malignantly remain
    Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
    Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
    That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
    Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
    Would think upon you for your voices and
    Translate his malice towards you into love,
    Standing your friendly lord.

SICINIUS

    Thus to have said,
    As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
    And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
    Either his gracious promise, which you might,
    As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
    Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
    Which easily endures not article
    Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
    You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
    And pass'd him unelected.

BRUTUS

    Did you perceive
    He did solicit you in free contempt
    When he did need your loves, and do you think
    That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
    When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
    No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
    Against the rectorship of judgment?

SICINIUS

    Have you
    Ere now denied the asker? and now again
    Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
    Your sued-for tongues?

Third Citizen

    He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.

Second Citizen

    And will deny him:
    I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.

First Citizen

    I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.

BRUTUS

    Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
    They have chose a consul that will from them take
    Their liberties; make them of no more voice
    Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
    As therefore kept to do so.

SICINIUS

    Let them assemble,
    And on a safer judgment all revoke
    Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
    And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
    With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
    How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
    Thinking upon his services, took from you
    The apprehension of his present portance,
    Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
    After the inveterate hate he bears you.

BRUTUS

    Lay
    A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
    No impediment between, but that you must
    Cast your election on him.

SICINIUS

    Say, you chose him
    More after our commandment than as guided
    By your own true affections, and that your minds,
    Preoccupied with what you rather must do
    Than what you should, made you against the grain
    To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.

BRUTUS

    Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
    How youngly he began to serve his country,
    How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
    The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
    That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
    Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
    Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
    That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
    And [Censorinus,] nobly named so,
    Twice being [by the people chosen] censor,
    Was his great ancestor.

SICINIUS

    One thus descended,
    That hath beside well in his person wrought
    To be set high in place, we did commend
    To your remembrances: but you have found,
    Scaling his present bearing with his past,
    That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
    Your sudden approbation.

BRUTUS

    Say, you ne'er had done't--
    Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
    And presently, when you have drawn your number,
    Repair to the Capitol.

All

    We will so: almost all
    Repent in their election.

    Exeunt Citizens

BRUTUS

    Let them go on;
    This mutiny were better put in hazard,
    Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
    If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
    With their refusal, both observe and answer
    The vantage of his anger.

SICINIUS

    To the Capitol, come:
    We will be there before the stream o' the people;
    And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
    Which we have goaded onward.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Rome. A street.

    Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators

CORIOLANUS

    Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?

LARTIUS

    He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
    Our swifter composition.

CORIOLANUS

    So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
    Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
    Upon's again.

COMINIUS

    They are worn, lord consul, so,
    That we shall hardly in our ages see
    Their banners wave again.

CORIOLANUS

    Saw you Aufidius?

LARTIUS

    On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
    Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
    Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.

CORIOLANUS

    Spoke he of me?

LARTIUS

    He did, my lord.

CORIOLANUS

    How? what?

LARTIUS

    How often he had met you, sword to sword;
    That of all things upon the earth he hated
    Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
    To hopeless restitution, so he might
    Be call'd your vanquisher.

CORIOLANUS

    At Antium lives he?

LARTIUS

    At Antium.

CORIOLANUS

    I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
    To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.

    Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS
    Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
    The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
    For they do prank them in authority,
    Against all noble sufferance.

SICINIUS

    Pass no further.

CORIOLANUS

    Ha! what is that?

BRUTUS

    It will be dangerous to go on: no further.

CORIOLANUS

    What makes this change?

MENENIUS

    The matter?

COMINIUS

    Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?

BRUTUS

    Cominius, no.

CORIOLANUS

    Have I had children's voices?

First Senator

    Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.

BRUTUS

    The people are incensed against him.

SICINIUS

    Stop,
    Or all will fall in broil.

CORIOLANUS

    Are these your herd?
    Must these have voices, that can yield them now
    And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
    your offices?
    You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
    Have you not set them on?

MENENIUS

    Be calm, be calm.

CORIOLANUS

    It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
    To curb the will of the nobility:
    Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
    Nor ever will be ruled.

BRUTUS

    Call't not a plot:
    The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
    When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
    Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
    Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.

CORIOLANUS

    Why, this was known before.

BRUTUS

    Not to them all.

CORIOLANUS

    Have you inform'd them sithence?

BRUTUS

    How! I inform them!

CORIOLANUS

    You are like to do such business.

BRUTUS

    Not unlike,
    Each way, to better yours.

CORIOLANUS

    Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
    Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
    Your fellow tribune.

SICINIUS

    You show too much of that
    For which the people stir: if you will pass
    To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
    Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
    Or never be so noble as a consul,
    Nor yoke with him for tribune.

MENENIUS

    Let's be calm.

COMINIUS

    The people are abused; set on. This paltering
    Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
    Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
    I' the plain way of his merit.

CORIOLANUS

    Tell me of corn!
    This was my speech, and I will speak't again--

MENENIUS

    Not now, not now.

First Senator

    Not in this heat, sir, now.

CORIOLANUS

    Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
    I crave their pardons:
    For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
    Regard me as I do not flatter, and
    Therein behold themselves: I say again,
    In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
    The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
    Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
    and scatter'd,
    By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
    Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
    Which they have given to beggars.

MENENIUS

    Well, no more.

First Senator

    No more words, we beseech you.

CORIOLANUS

    How! no more!
    As for my country I have shed my blood,
    Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
    Coin words till their decay against those measles,
    Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
    The very way to catch them.

BRUTUS

    You speak o' the people,
    As if you were a god to punish, not
    A man of their infirmity.

SICINIUS

    'Twere well
    We let the people know't.

MENENIUS

    What, what? his choler?

CORIOLANUS

    Choler!
    Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
    By Jove, 'twould be my mind!

SICINIUS

    It is a mind
    That shall remain a poison where it is,
    Not poison any further.

CORIOLANUS

    Shall remain!
    Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
    His absolute 'shall'?

COMINIUS

    'Twas from the canon.

CORIOLANUS

    'Shall'!
    O good but most unwise patricians! why,
    You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
    Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
    That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
    The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
    To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
    And make your channel his? If he have power
    Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
    Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
    Be not as common fools; if you are not,
    Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
    If they be senators: and they are no less,
    When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
    Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
    And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
    His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
    Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
    It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
    To know, when two authorities are up,
    Neither supreme, how soon confusion
    May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
    The one by the other.

COMINIUS

    Well, on to the market-place.

CORIOLANUS

    Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
    The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
    Sometime in Greece,--

MENENIUS

    Well, well, no more of that.

CORIOLANUS

    Though there the people had more absolute power,
    I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
    The ruin of the state.

BRUTUS

    Why, shall the people give
    One that speaks thus their voice?

CORIOLANUS

    I'll give my reasons,
    More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
    Was not our recompense, resting well assured
    That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
    Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
    They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
    Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
    Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
    Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
    Which they have often made against the senate,
    All cause unborn, could never be the motive
    Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
    How shall this bisson multitude digest
    The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
    What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
    We are the greater poll, and in true fear
    They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
    The nature of our seats and make the rabble
    Call our cares fears; which will in time
    Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
    The crows to peck the eagles.

MENENIUS

    Come, enough.

BRUTUS

    Enough, with over-measure.

CORIOLANUS

    No, take more:
    What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
    Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
    Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
    Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
    Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
    Of general ignorance,--it must omit
    Real necessities, and give way the while
    To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
    it follows,
    Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
    You that will be less fearful than discreet,
    That love the fundamental part of state
    More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
    A noble life before a long, and wish
    To jump a body with a dangerous physic
    That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
    The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
    The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
    Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
    Of that integrity which should become't,
    Not having the power to do the good it would,
    For the in which doth control't.

BRUTUS

    Has said enough.

SICINIUS

    Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
    As traitors do.

CORIOLANUS

    Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
    What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
    On whom depending, their obedience fails
    To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
    When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
    Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
    Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
    And throw their power i' the dust.

BRUTUS

    Manifest treason!

SICINIUS

    This a consul? no.

BRUTUS

    The aediles, ho!

    Enter an AEdile
    Let him be apprehended.

SICINIUS

    Go, call the people:

    Exit AEdile
    in whose name myself
    Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
    A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
    And follow to thine answer.

CORIOLANUS

    Hence, old goat!
    Senators, & C We'll surety him.

COMINIUS

    Aged sir, hands off.

CORIOLANUS

    Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
    Out of thy garments.

SICINIUS

    Help, ye citizens!

    Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with the AEdiles

MENENIUS

    On both sides more respect.

SICINIUS

    Here's he that would take from you all your power.

BRUTUS

    Seize him, AEdiles!

Citizens

    Down with him! down with him!
    Senators, & C Weapons, weapons, weapons!

    They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying
    'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
    'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
    'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'

MENENIUS

    What is about to be? I am out of breath;
    Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
    To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
    Speak, good Sicinius.

SICINIUS

    Hear me, people; peace!

Citizens

    Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.

SICINIUS

    You are at point to lose your liberties:
    Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
    Whom late you have named for consul.

MENENIUS

    Fie, fie, fie!
    This is the way to kindle, not to quench.

First Senator

    To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.

SICINIUS

    What is the city but the people?

Citizens

    True,
    The people are the city.

BRUTUS

    By the consent of all, we were establish'd
    The people's magistrates.

Citizens

    You so remain.

MENENIUS

    And so are like to do.

COMINIUS

    That is the way to lay the city flat;
    To bring the roof to the foundation,
    And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
    In heaps and piles of ruin.

SICINIUS

    This deserves death.

BRUTUS

    Or let us stand to our authority,
    Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
    Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
    We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
    Of present death.

SICINIUS

    Therefore lay hold of him;
    Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
    Into destruction cast him.

BRUTUS

    AEdiles, seize him!

Citizens

    Yield, Marcius, yield!

MENENIUS

    Hear me one word;
    Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.

AEdile

    Peace, peace!

MENENIUS

    [To BRUTUS] Be that you seem, truly your
    country's friend,
    And temperately proceed to what you would
    Thus violently redress.

BRUTUS

    Sir, those cold ways,
    That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
    Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
    And bear him to the rock.

CORIOLANUS

    No, I'll die here.

    Drawing his sword
    There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
    Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.

MENENIUS

    Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.

BRUTUS

    Lay hands upon him.

COMINIUS

    Help Marcius, help,
    You that be noble; help him, young and old!

Citizens

    Down with him, down with him!

    In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the AEdiles, and the People, are beat in

MENENIUS

    Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
    All will be naught else.

Second Senator

    Get you gone.

COMINIUS

    Stand fast;
    We have as many friends as enemies.

MENENIUS

    Sham it be put to that?

First Senator

    The gods forbid!
    I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
    Leave us to cure this cause.

MENENIUS

    For 'tis a sore upon us,
    You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.

COMINIUS

    Come, sir, along with us.

CORIOLANUS

    I would they were barbarians--as they are,
    Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
    Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--

MENENIUS

    Be gone;
    Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
    One time will owe another.

CORIOLANUS

    On fair ground
    I could beat forty of them.

COMINIUS

    I could myself
    Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
    two tribunes:
    But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
    And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
    Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
    Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
    Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
    What they are used to bear.

MENENIUS

    Pray you, be gone:
    I'll try whether my old wit be in request
    With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
    With cloth of any colour.

COMINIUS

    Nay, come away.

    Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others

A Patrician

    This man has marr'd his fortune.

MENENIUS

    His nature is too noble for the world:
    He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
    Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
    What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
    And, being angry, does forget that ever
    He heard the name of death.

    A noise within
    Here's goodly work!

Second Patrician

    I would they were abed!

MENENIUS

    I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
    Could he not speak 'em fair?

    Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble

SICINIUS

    Where is this viper
    That would depopulate the city and
    Be every man himself?

MENENIUS

    You worthy tribunes,--

SICINIUS

    He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
    With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
    And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
    Than the severity of the public power
    Which he so sets at nought.

First Citizen

    He shall well know
    The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
    And we their hands.

Citizens

    He shall, sure on't.

MENENIUS

    Sir, sir,--

SICINIUS

    Peace!

MENENIUS

    Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
    With modest warrant.

SICINIUS

    Sir, how comes't that you
    Have holp to make this rescue?

MENENIUS

    Hear me speak:
    As I do know the consul's worthiness,
    So can I name his faults,--

SICINIUS

    Consul! what consul?

MENENIUS

    The consul Coriolanus.

BRUTUS

    He consul!

Citizens

    No, no, no, no, no.

MENENIUS

    If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
    I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
    The which shall turn you to no further harm
    Than so much loss of time.

SICINIUS

    Speak briefly then;
    For we are peremptory to dispatch
    This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
    Were but one danger, and to keep him here
    Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
    He dies to-night.

MENENIUS

    Now the good gods forbid
    That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
    Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
    In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
    Should now eat up her own!

SICINIUS

    He's a disease that must be cut away.

MENENIUS

    O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
    Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
    What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
    Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
    Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
    By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
    And what is left, to lose it by his country,
    Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
    A brand to the end o' the world.

SICINIUS

    This is clean kam.

BRUTUS

    Merely awry: when he did love his country,
    It honour'd him.

MENENIUS

    The service of the foot
    Being once gangrened, is not then respected
    For what before it was.

BRUTUS

    We'll hear no more.
    Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
    Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
    Spread further.

MENENIUS

    One word more, one word.
    This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
    The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
    Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
    Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
    And sack great Rome with Romans.

BRUTUS

    If it were so,--

SICINIUS

    What do ye talk?
    Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
    Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.

MENENIUS

    Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
    Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
    In bolted language; meal and bran together
    He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
    I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
    Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
    In peace, to his utmost peril.

First Senator

    Noble tribunes,
    It is the humane way: the other course
    Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
    Unknown to the beginning.

SICINIUS

    Noble Menenius,
    Be you then as the people's officer.
    Masters, lay down your weapons.

BRUTUS

    Go not home.

SICINIUS

    Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
    Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
    In our first way.

MENENIUS

    I'll bring him to you.

    To the Senators
    Let me desire your company: he must come,
    Or what is worst will follow.

First Senator

    Pray you, let's to him.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.

    Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians

CORIOLANUS

    Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
    Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
    Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
    That the precipitation might down stretch
    Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
    Be thus to them.

A Patrician

    You do the nobler.

CORIOLANUS

    I muse my mother
    Does not approve me further, who was wont
    To call them woollen vassals, things created
    To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
    In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
    When one but of my ordinance stood up
    To speak of peace or war.

    Enter VOLUMNIA
    I talk of you:
    Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
    False to my nature? Rather say I play
    The man I am.

VOLUMNIA

    O, sir, sir, sir,
    I would have had you put your power well on,
    Before you had worn it out.

CORIOLANUS

    Let go.

VOLUMNIA

    You might have been enough the man you are,
    With striving less to be so; lesser had been
    The thwartings of your dispositions, if
    You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
    Ere they lack'd power to cross you.

CORIOLANUS

    Let them hang.

A Patrician

    Ay, and burn too.

    Enter MENENIUS and Senators

MENENIUS

    Come, come, you have been too rough, something
    too rough;
    You must return and mend it.

First Senator

    There's no remedy;
    Unless, by not so doing, our good city
    Cleave in the midst, and perish.

VOLUMNIA

    Pray, be counsell'd:
    I have a heart as little apt as yours,
    But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
    To better vantage.

MENENIUS

    Well said, noble woman?
    Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
    The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
    For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
    Which I can scarcely bear.

CORIOLANUS

    What must I do?

MENENIUS

    Return to the tribunes.

CORIOLANUS

    Well, what then? what then?

MENENIUS

    Repent what you have spoke.

CORIOLANUS

    For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
    Must I then do't to them?

VOLUMNIA

    You are too absolute;
    Though therein you can never be too noble,
    But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
    Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
    I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
    In peace what each of them by the other lose,
    That they combine not there.

CORIOLANUS

    Tush, tush!

MENENIUS

    A good demand.

VOLUMNIA

    If it be honour in your wars to seem
    The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
    You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
    That it shall hold companionship in peace
    With honour, as in war, since that to both
    It stands in like request?

CORIOLANUS

    Why force you this?

VOLUMNIA

    Because that now it lies you on to speak
    To the people; not by your own instruction,
    Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
    But with such words that are but rooted in
    Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
    Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
    Now, this no more dishonours you at all
    Than to take in a town with gentle words,
    Which else would put you to your fortune and
    The hazard of much blood.
    I would dissemble with my nature where
    My fortunes and my friends at stake required
    I should do so in honour: I am in this,
    Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
    And you will rather show our general louts
    How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
    For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
    Of what that want might ruin.

MENENIUS

    Noble lady!
    Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
    Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
    Of what is past.

VOLUMNIA

    I prithee now, my son,
    Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
    And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
    Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
    Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
    More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
    Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
    Now humble as the ripest mulberry
    That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
    Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
    Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
    Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
    In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
    Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
    As thou hast power and person.

MENENIUS

    This but done,
    Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
    For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
    As words to little purpose.

VOLUMNIA

    Prithee now,
    Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
    Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
    Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.

    Enter COMINIUS

COMINIUS

    I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
    You make strong party, or defend yourself
    By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.

MENENIUS

    Only fair speech.

COMINIUS

    I think 'twill serve, if he
    Can thereto frame his spirit.

VOLUMNIA

    He must, and will
    Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.

CORIOLANUS

    Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
    Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
    A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
    Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
    This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
    And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
    You have put me now to such a part which never
    I shall discharge to the life.

COMINIUS

    Come, come, we'll prompt you.

VOLUMNIA

    I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
    My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
    To have my praise for this, perform a part
    Thou hast not done before.

CORIOLANUS

    Well, I must do't:
    Away, my disposition, and possess me
    Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
    Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
    Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
    That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
    Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
    The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
    Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
    Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
    That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
    Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
    And by my body's action teach my mind
    A most inherent baseness.

VOLUMNIA

    At thy choice, then:
    To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
    Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
    Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
    Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
    With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
    Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
    But owe thy pride thyself.

CORIOLANUS

    Pray, be content:
    Mother, I am going to the market-place;
    Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
    Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
    Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
    Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
    Or never trust to what my tongue can do
    I' the way of flattery further.

VOLUMNIA

    Do your will.

    Exit

COMINIUS

    Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
    To answer mildly; for they are prepared
    With accusations, as I hear, more strong
    Than are upon you yet.

CORIOLANUS

    The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
    Let them accuse me by invention, I
    Will answer in mine honour.

MENENIUS

    Ay, but mildly.

CORIOLANUS

    Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same. The Forum.

    Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS

BRUTUS

    In this point charge him home, that he affects
    Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
    Enforce him with his envy to the people,
    And that the spoil got on the Antiates
    Was ne'er distributed.

    Enter an AEdile
    What, will he come?

AEdile

    He's coming.

BRUTUS

    How accompanied?

AEdile

    With old Menenius, and those senators
    That always favour'd him.

SICINIUS

    Have you a catalogue
    Of all the voices that we have procured
    Set down by the poll?

AEdile

    I have; 'tis ready.

SICINIUS

    Have you collected them by tribes?

AEdile

    I have.

SICINIUS

    Assemble presently the people hither;
    And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
    I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
    For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
    If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
    Insisting on the old prerogative
    And power i' the truth o' the cause.

AEdile

    I shall inform them.

BRUTUS

    And when such time they have begun to cry,
    Let them not cease, but with a din confused
    Enforce the present execution
    Of what we chance to sentence.

AEdile

    Very well.

SICINIUS

    Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
    When we shall hap to give 't them.

BRUTUS

    Go about it.

    Exit AEdile
    Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
    Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
    Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
    Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
    What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
    With us to break his neck.

SICINIUS

    Well, here he comes.

    Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS, with Senators and Patricians

MENENIUS

    Calmly, I do beseech you.

CORIOLANUS

    Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
    Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
    Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
    Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
    Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
    And not our streets with war!

First Senator

    Amen, amen.

MENENIUS

    A noble wish.

    Re-enter AEdile, with Citizens

SICINIUS

    Draw near, ye people.

AEdile

    List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!

CORIOLANUS

    First, hear me speak.

Both Tribunes

    Well, say. Peace, ho!

CORIOLANUS

    Shall I be charged no further than this present?
    Must all determine here?

SICINIUS

    I do demand,
    If you submit you to the people's voices,
    Allow their officers and are content
    To suffer lawful censure for such faults
    As shall be proved upon you?

CORIOLANUS

    I am content.

MENENIUS

    Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
    The warlike service he has done, consider; think
    Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
    Like graves i' the holy churchyard.

CORIOLANUS

    Scratches with briers,
    Scars to move laughter only.

MENENIUS

    Consider further,
    That when he speaks not like a citizen,
    You find him like a soldier: do not take
    His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
    But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
    Rather than envy you.

COMINIUS

    Well, well, no more.

CORIOLANUS

    What is the matter
    That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
    I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
    You take it off again?

SICINIUS

    Answer to us.

CORIOLANUS

    Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.

SICINIUS

    We charge you, that you have contrived to take
    From Rome all season'd office and to wind
    Yourself into a power tyrannical;
    For which you are a traitor to the people.

CORIOLANUS

    How! traitor!

MENENIUS

    Nay, temperately; your promise.

CORIOLANUS

    The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
    Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
    Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
    In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
    Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
    'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
    As I do pray the gods.

SICINIUS

    Mark you this, people?

Citizens

    To the rock, to the rock with him!

SICINIUS

    Peace!
    We need not put new matter to his charge:
    What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
    Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
    Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
    Those whose great power must try him; even this,
    So criminal and in such capital kind,
    Deserves the extremest death.

BRUTUS

    But since he hath
    Served well for Rome,--

CORIOLANUS

    What do you prate of service?

BRUTUS

    I talk of that, that know it.

CORIOLANUS

    You?

MENENIUS

    Is this the promise that you made your mother?

COMINIUS

    Know, I pray you,--

CORIOLANUS

    I know no further:
    Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
    Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
    But with a grain a day, I would not buy
    Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
    Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
    To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'

SICINIUS

    For that he has,
    As much as in him lies, from time to time
    Envied against the people, seeking means
    To pluck away their power, as now at last
    Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
    Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
    That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
    And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
    Even from this instant, banish him our city,
    In peril of precipitation
    From off the rock Tarpeian never more
    To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
    I say it shall be so.

Citizens

    It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
    He's banish'd, and it shall be so.

COMINIUS

    Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--

SICINIUS

    He's sentenced; no more hearing.

COMINIUS

    Let me speak:
    I have been consul, and can show for Rome
    Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
    My country's good with a respect more tender,
    More holy and profound, than mine own life,
    My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
    And treasure of my loins; then if I would
    Speak that,--

SICINIUS

    We know your drift: speak what?

BRUTUS

    There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
    As enemy to the people and his country:
    It shall be so.

Citizens

    It shall be so, it shall be so.

CORIOLANUS

    You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
    As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
    As the dead carcasses of unburied men
    That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
    And here remain with your uncertainty!
    Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
    Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
    Fan you into despair! Have the power still
    To banish your defenders; till at length
    Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
    Making not reservation of yourselves,
    Still your own foes, deliver you as most
    Abated captives to some nation
    That won you without blows! Despising,
    For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
    There is a world elsewhere.

    Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, MENENIUS, Senators, and Patricians

AEdile

    The people's enemy is gone, is gone!

Citizens

    Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!

    Shouting, and throwing up their caps

SICINIUS

    Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
    As he hath followed you, with all despite;
    Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
    Attend us through the city.

Citizens

    Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.
    The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Rome. Before a gate of the city.

    Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS, COMINIUS, with the young Nobility of Rome

CORIOLANUS

    Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
    With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
    Where is your ancient courage? you were used
    To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
    That common chances common men could bear;
    That when the sea was calm all boats alike
    Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
    When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
    A noble cunning: you were used to load me
    With precepts that would make invincible
    The heart that conn'd them.

VIRGILIA

    O heavens! O heavens!

CORIOLANUS

    Nay! prithee, woman,--

VOLUMNIA

    Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
    And occupations perish!

CORIOLANUS

    What, what, what!
    I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
    Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
    If you had been the wife of Hercules,
    Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
    Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
    Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
    I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
    Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
    And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
    I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
    Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
    'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
    As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
    My hazards still have been your solace: and
    Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
    Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
    Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
    Will or exceed the common or be caught
    With cautelous baits and practise.

VOLUMNIA

    My first son.
    Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
    With thee awhile: determine on some course,
    More than a wild exposture to each chance
    That starts i' the way before thee.

CORIOLANUS

    O the gods!

COMINIUS

    I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
    Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
    And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
    A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
    O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
    And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
    I' the absence of the needer.

CORIOLANUS

    Fare ye well:
    Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
    Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
    That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
    Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
    My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
    Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
    While I remain above the ground, you shall
    Hear from me still, and never of me aught
    But what is like me formerly.

MENENIUS

    That's worthily
    As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
    If I could shake off but one seven years
    From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
    I'ld with thee every foot.

CORIOLANUS

    Give me thy hand: Come.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. A street near the gate.

    Enter SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and an AEdile

SICINIUS

    Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
    The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
    In his behalf.

BRUTUS

    Now we have shown our power,
    Let us seem humbler after it is done
    Than when it was a-doing.

SICINIUS

    Bid them home:
    Say their great enemy is gone, and they
    Stand in their ancient strength.

BRUTUS

    Dismiss them home.

    Exit AEdile
    Here comes his mother.

SICINIUS

    Let's not meet her.

BRUTUS

    Why?

SICINIUS

    They say she's mad.

BRUTUS

    They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.

    Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS

VOLUMNIA

    O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
    Requite your love!

MENENIUS

    Peace, peace; be not so loud.

VOLUMNIA

    If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
    Nay, and you shall hear some.

    To BRUTUS
    Will you be gone?

VIRGILIA

    [To SICINIUS] You shall stay too: I would I had the power
    To say so to my husband.

SICINIUS

    Are you mankind?

VOLUMNIA

    Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
    Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
    To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
    Than thou hast spoken words?

SICINIUS

    O blessed heavens!

VOLUMNIA

    More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
    And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
    Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
    Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
    His good sword in his hand.

SICINIUS

    What then?

VIRGILIA

    What then!
    He'ld make an end of thy posterity.

VOLUMNIA

    Bastards and all.
    Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!

MENENIUS

    Come, come, peace.

SICINIUS

    I would he had continued to his country
    As he began, and not unknit himself
    The noble knot he made.

BRUTUS

    I would he had.

VOLUMNIA

    'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
    Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
    As I can of those mysteries which heaven
    Will not have earth to know.

BRUTUS

    Pray, let us go.

VOLUMNIA

    Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
    You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
    As far as doth the Capitol exceed
    The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--
    This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
    Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.

BRUTUS

    Well, well, we'll leave you.

SICINIUS

    Why stay we to be baited
    With one that wants her wits?

VOLUMNIA

    Take my prayers with you.

    Exeunt Tribunes
    I would the gods had nothing else to do
    But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
    But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
    Of what lies heavy to't.

MENENIUS

    You have told them home;
    And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?

VOLUMNIA

    Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
    And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:
    Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
    In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.

MENENIUS

    Fie, fie, fie!

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A highway between Rome and Antium.

    Enter a Roman and a Volsce, meeting

Roman

    I know you well, sir, and you know
    me: your name, I think, is Adrian.

Volsce

    It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.

Roman

    I am a Roman; and my services are,
    as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?

Volsce

    Nicanor? no.

Roman

    The same, sir.

Volsce

    You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
    favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
    news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
    to find you out there: you have well saved me a
    day's journey.

Roman

    There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
    people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.

Volsce

    Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
    so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
    hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.

Roman

    The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
    would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
    so to heart the banishment of that worthy
    Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
    all power from the people and to pluck from them
    their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
    tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
    breaking out.

Volsce

    Coriolanus banished!

Roman

    Banished, sir.

Volsce

    You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.

Roman

    The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
    said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
    when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
    Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
    great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
    of his country.

Volsce

    He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
    accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
    business, and I will merrily accompany you home.

Roman

    I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
    strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
    their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?

Volsce

    A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
    distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
    and to be on foot at an hour's warning.

Roman

    I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
    man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
    So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.

Volsce

    You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
    to be glad of yours.

Roman

    Well, let us go together.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Antium. Before Aufidius's house.

    Enter CORIOLANUS in mean apparel, disguised and muffled

CORIOLANUS

    A goodly city is this Antium. City,
    'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
    Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
    Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
    Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
    In puny battle slay me.

    Enter a Citizen
    Save you, sir.

Citizen

    And you.

CORIOLANUS

    Direct me, if it be your will,
    Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?

Citizen

    He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
    At his house this night.

CORIOLANUS

    Which is his house, beseech you?

Citizen

    This, here before you.

CORIOLANUS

    Thank you, sir: farewell.

    Exit Citizen
    O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
    Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
    Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
    Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
    Unseparable, shall within this hour,
    On a dissension of a doit, break out
    To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
    Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
    To take the one the other, by some chance,
    Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
    And interjoin their issues. So with me:
    My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
    This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
    He does fair justice; if he give me way,
    I'll do his country service.

    Exit

SCENE V. The same. A hall in Aufidius's house.

    Music within. Enter a Servingman

First Servingman

    Wine, wine, wine! What service
    is here! I think our fellows are asleep.

    Exit

    Enter a second Servingman

Second Servingman

    Where's Cotus? my master calls
    for him. Cotus!

    Exit

    Enter CORIOLANUS

CORIOLANUS

    A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
    Appear not like a guest.

    Re-enter the first Servingman

First Servingman

    What would you have, friend? whence are you?
    Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.

    Exit

CORIOLANUS

    I have deserved no better entertainment,
    In being Coriolanus.

    Re-enter second Servingman

Second Servingman

    Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
    head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
    Pray, get you out.

CORIOLANUS

    Away!

Second Servingman

    Away! get you away.

CORIOLANUS

    Now thou'rt troublesome.

Second Servingman

    Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.

    Enter a third Servingman. The first meets him

Third Servingman

    What fellow's this?

First Servingman

    A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
    out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.

    Retires

Third Servingman

    What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
    the house.

CORIOLANUS

    Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.

Third Servingman

    What are you?

CORIOLANUS

    A gentleman.

Third Servingman

    A marvellous poor one.

CORIOLANUS

    True, so I am.

Third Servingman

    Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
    station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.

CORIOLANUS

    Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.

    Pushes him away

Third Servingman

    What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
    strange guest he has here.

Second Servingman

    And I shall.

    Exit

Third Servingman

    Where dwellest thou?

CORIOLANUS

    Under the canopy.

Third Servingman

    Under the canopy!

CORIOLANUS

    Ay.

Third Servingman

    Where's that?

CORIOLANUS

    I' the city of kites and crows.

Third Servingman

    I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
    Then thou dwellest with daws too?

CORIOLANUS

    No, I serve not thy master.

Third Servingman

    How, sir! do you meddle with my master?

CORIOLANUS

    Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
    mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
    trencher, hence!

    Beats him away. Exit third Servingman

    Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servingman

AUFIDIUS

    Where is this fellow?

Second Servingman

    Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
    disturbing the lords within.

    Retires

AUFIDIUS

    Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
    Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS

    If, Tullus,

    Unmuffling
    Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
    Think me for the man I am, necessity
    Commands me name myself.

AUFIDIUS

    What is thy name?

CORIOLANUS

    A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
    And harsh in sound to thine.

AUFIDIUS

    Say, what's thy name?
    Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
    Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
    Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?

CORIOLANUS

    Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
    thou me yet?

AUFIDIUS

    I know thee not: thy name?

CORIOLANUS

    My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
    To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
    Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
    My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
    The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
    Shed for my thankless country are requited
    But with that surname; a good memory,
    And witness of the malice and displeasure
    Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
    The cruelty and envy of the people,
    Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
    Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
    And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
    Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
    Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
    Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
    I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
    I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
    To be full quit of those my banishers,
    Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
    A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
    Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
    Of shame seen through thy country, speed
    thee straight,
    And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
    That my revengeful services may prove
    As benefits to thee, for I will fight
    Against my canker'd country with the spleen
    Of all the under fiends. But if so be
    Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
    Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
    Longer to live most weary, and present
    My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
    Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
    Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
    Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
    And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
    It be to do thee service.

AUFIDIUS

    O Marcius, Marcius!
    Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
    A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
    Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
    And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
    Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
    Mine arms about that body, where against
    My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
    And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
    The anvil of my sword, and do contest
    As hotly and as nobly with thy love
    As ever in ambitious strength I did
    Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
    I loved the maid I married; never man
    Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
    Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
    Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
    Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
    We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
    Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
    Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
    Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
    Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
    We have been down together in my sleep,
    Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
    And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
    Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
    Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
    From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
    Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
    Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
    And take our friendly senators by the hands;
    Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
    Who am prepared against your territories,
    Though not for Rome itself.

CORIOLANUS

    You bless me, gods!

AUFIDIUS

    Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
    The leading of thine own revenges, take
    The one half of my commission; and set down--
    As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
    Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
    Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
    Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
    To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
    Let me commend thee first to those that shall
    Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
    And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
    Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!

    Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two Servingmen come forward

First Servingman

    Here's a strange alteration!

Second Servingman

    By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
    a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
    false report of him.

First Servingman

    What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
    finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.

Second Servingman

    Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
    him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
    cannot tell how to term it.

First Servingman

    He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
    but I thought there was more in him than I could think.

Second Servingman

    So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
    man i' the world.

First Servingman

    I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.

Second Servingman

    Who, my master?

First Servingman

    Nay, it's no matter for that.

Second Servingman

    Worth six on him.

First Servingman

    Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
    greater soldier.

Second Servingman

    Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
    for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.

First Servingman

    Ay, and for an assault too.

    Re-enter third Servingman

Third Servingman

    O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!

First Servingman Second Servingman

    What, what, what? let's partake.

Third Servingman

    I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
    lieve be a condemned man.

First Servingman Second Servingman

    Wherefore? wherefore?

Third Servingman

    Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
    Caius Marcius.

First Servingman

    Why do you say 'thwack our general '?

Third Servingman

    I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
    good enough for him.

Second Servingman

    Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
    hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.

First Servingman

    He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
    on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
    him like a carbon ado.

Second Servingman

    An he had been cannibally given, he might have
    broiled and eaten him too.

First Servingman

    But, more of thy news?

Third Servingman

    Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
    and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
    question asked him by any of the senators, but they
    stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
    mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
    turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
    the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
    the middle and but one half of what he was
    yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
    and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
    and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
    will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.

Second Servingman

    And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.

Third Servingman

    Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
    many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
    were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
    we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.

First Servingman

    Directitude! what's that?

Third Servingman

    But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
    and the man in blood, they will out of their
    burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
    him.

First Servingman

    But when goes this forward?

Third Servingman

    To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
    drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
    parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
    wipe their lips.

Second Servingman

    Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
    This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
    tailors, and breed ballad-makers.

First Servingman

    Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
    day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
    full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
    mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
    bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.

Second Servingman

    'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
    be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
    great maker of cuckolds.

First Servingman

    Ay, and it makes men hate one another.

Third Servingman

    Reason; because they then less need one another.
    The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
    as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.

All

    In, in, in, in!

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Rome. A public place.

    Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS

SICINIUS

    We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
    His remedies are tame i' the present peace
    And quietness of the people, which before
    Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
    Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
    Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
    Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
    Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
    About their functions friendly.

BRUTUS

    We stood to't in good time.

    Enter MENENIUS
    Is this Menenius?

SICINIUS

    'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.

Both Tribunes

    Hail sir!

MENENIUS

    Hail to you both!

SICINIUS

    Your Coriolanus
    Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
    The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
    Were he more angry at it.

MENENIUS

    All's well; and might have been much better, if
    He could have temporized.

SICINIUS

    Where is he, hear you?

MENENIUS

    Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
    Hear nothing from him.

    Enter three or four Citizens

Citizens

    The gods preserve you both!

SICINIUS

    God-den, our neighbours.

BRUTUS

    God-den to you all, god-den to you all.

First Citizen

    Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
    Are bound to pray for you both.

SICINIUS

    Live, and thrive!

BRUTUS

    Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
    Had loved you as we did.

Citizens

    Now the gods keep you!

Both Tribunes

    Farewell, farewell.

    Exeunt Citizens

SICINIUS

    This is a happier and more comely time
    Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
    Crying confusion.

BRUTUS

    Caius Marcius was
    A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
    O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
    Self-loving,--

SICINIUS

    And affecting one sole throne,
    Without assistance.

MENENIUS

    I think not so.

SICINIUS

    We should by this, to all our lamentation,
    If he had gone forth consul, found it so.

BRUTUS

    The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
    Sits safe and still without him.

    Enter an AEdile

AEdile

    Worthy tribunes,
    There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
    Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
    Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
    And with the deepest malice of the war
    Destroy what lies before 'em.

MENENIUS

    'Tis Aufidius,
    Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
    Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
    Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
    And durst not once peep out.

SICINIUS

    Come, what talk you
    Of Marcius?

BRUTUS

    Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
    The Volsces dare break with us.

MENENIUS

    Cannot be!
    We have record that very well it can,
    And three examples of the like have been
    Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
    Before you punish him, where he heard this,
    Lest you shall chance to whip your information
    And beat the messenger who bids beware
    Of what is to be dreaded.

SICINIUS

    Tell not me:
    I know this cannot be.

BRUTUS

    Not possible.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    The nobles in great earnestness are going
    All to the senate-house: some news is come
    That turns their countenances.

SICINIUS

    'Tis this slave;--
    Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
    Nothing but his report.

Messenger

    Yes, worthy sir,
    The slave's report is seconded; and more,
    More fearful, is deliver'd.

SICINIUS

    What more fearful?

Messenger

    It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
    How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
    Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
    And vows revenge as spacious as between
    The young'st and oldest thing.

SICINIUS

    This is most likely!

BRUTUS

    Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
    Good Marcius home again.

SICINIUS

    The very trick on't.

MENENIUS

    This is unlikely:
    He and Aufidius can no more atone
    Than violentest contrariety.

    Enter a second Messenger

Second Messenger

    You are sent for to the senate:
    A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
    Associated with Aufidius, rages
    Upon our territories; and have already
    O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
    What lay before them.

    Enter COMINIUS

COMINIUS

    O, you have made good work!

MENENIUS

    What news? what news?

COMINIUS

    You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
    To melt the city leads upon your pates,
    To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--

MENENIUS

    What's the news? what's the news?

COMINIUS

    Your temples burned in their cement, and
    Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
    Into an auger's bore.

MENENIUS

    Pray now, your news?
    You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
    If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--

COMINIUS

    If!
    He is their god: he leads them like a thing
    Made by some other deity than nature,
    That shapes man better; and they follow him,
    Against us brats, with no less confidence
    Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
    Or butchers killing flies.

MENENIUS

    You have made good work,
    You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
    on the voice of occupation and
    The breath of garlic-eaters!

COMINIUS

    He will shake
    Your Rome about your ears.

MENENIUS

    As Hercules
    Did shake down mellow fruit.
    You have made fair work!

BRUTUS

    But is this true, sir?

COMINIUS

    Ay; and you'll look pale
    Before you find it other. All the regions
    Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
    Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
    And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
    Your enemies and his find something in him.

MENENIUS

    We are all undone, unless
    The noble man have mercy.

COMINIUS

    Who shall ask it?
    The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
    Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
    Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
    Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
    As those should do that had deserved his hate,
    And therein show'd like enemies.

MENENIUS

    'Tis true:
    If he were putting to my house the brand
    That should consume it, I have not the face
    To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
    You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!

COMINIUS

    You have brought
    A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
    So incapable of help.

Both Tribunes

    Say not we brought it.

MENENIUS

    How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
    And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
    Who did hoot him out o' the city.

COMINIUS

    But I fear
    They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
    The second name of men, obeys his points
    As if he were his officer: desperation
    Is all the policy, strength and defence,
    That Rome can make against them.

    Enter a troop of Citizens

MENENIUS

    Here come the clusters.
    And is Aufidius with him? You are they
    That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
    Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
    Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
    And not a hair upon a soldier's head
    Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
    As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
    And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
    if he could burn us all into one coal,
    We have deserved it.

Citizens

    Faith, we hear fearful news.

First Citizen

    For mine own part,
    When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.

Second Citizen

    And so did I.

Third Citizen

    And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
    many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
    though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
    it was against our will.

COMINIUS

    Ye re goodly things, you voices!

MENENIUS

    You have made
    Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?

COMINIUS

    O, ay, what else?

    Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS

SICINIUS

    Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
    These are a side that would be glad to have
    This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
    And show no sign of fear.

First Citizen

    The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
    I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
    him.

Second Citizen

    So did we all. But, come, let's home.

    Exeunt Citizens

BRUTUS

    I do not like this news.

SICINIUS

    Nor I.

BRUTUS

    Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
    Would buy this for a lie!

SICINIUS

    Pray, let us go.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. A camp, at a small distance from Rome.

    Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant

AUFIDIUS

    Do they still fly to the Roman?

Lieutenant

    I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
    Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
    Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
    And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
    Even by your own.

AUFIDIUS

    I cannot help it now,
    Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
    Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
    Even to my person, than I thought he would
    When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
    In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
    What cannot be amended.

Lieutenant

    Yet I wish, sir,--
    I mean for your particular,--you had not
    Join'd in commission with him; but either
    Had borne the action of yourself, or else
    To him had left it solely.

AUFIDIUS

    I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
    when he shall come to his account, he knows not
    What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
    And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
    To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
    And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
    Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
    As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
    That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
    Whene'er we come to our account.

Lieutenant

    Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?

AUFIDIUS

    All places yield to him ere he sits down;
    And the nobility of Rome are his:
    The senators and patricians love him too:
    The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
    Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
    To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
    As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
    By sovereignty of nature. First he was
    A noble servant to them; but he could not
    Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
    Which out of daily fortune ever taints
    The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
    To fail in the disposing of those chances
    Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
    Not to be other than one thing, not moving
    From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
    Even with the same austerity and garb
    As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
    As he hath spices of them all, not all,
    For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
    So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
    To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
    Lie in the interpretation of the time:
    And power, unto itself most commendable,
    Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
    To extol what it hath done.
    One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
    Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
    Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
    Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Rome. A public place.

    Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and others

MENENIUS

    No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
    Which was sometime his general; who loved him
    In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
    But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
    A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
    The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
    To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.

COMINIUS

    He would not seem to know me.

MENENIUS

    Do you hear?

COMINIUS

    Yet one time he did call me by my name:
    I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
    That we have bled together. Coriolanus
    He would not answer to: forbad all names;
    He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
    Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
    Of burning Rome.

MENENIUS

    Why, so: you have made good work!
    A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
    To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!

COMINIUS

    I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
    When it was less expected: he replied,
    It was a bare petition of a state
    To one whom they had punish'd.

MENENIUS

    Very well:
    Could he say less?

COMINIUS

    I offer'd to awaken his regard
    For's private friends: his answer to me was,
    He could not stay to pick them in a pile
    Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
    For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
    And still to nose the offence.

MENENIUS

    For one poor grain or two!
    I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
    And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
    You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
    Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.

SICINIUS

    Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
    In this so never-needed help, yet do not
    Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
    Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
    More than the instant army we can make,
    Might stop our countryman.

MENENIUS

    No, I'll not meddle.

SICINIUS

    Pray you, go to him.

MENENIUS

    What should I do?

BRUTUS

    Only make trial what your love can do
    For Rome, towards Marcius.

MENENIUS

    Well, and say that Marcius
    Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
    Unheard; what then?
    But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
    With his unkindness? say't be so?

SICINIUS

    Yet your good will
    must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
    As you intended well.

MENENIUS

    I'll undertake 't:
    I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
    And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
    He was not taken well; he had not dined:
    The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
    We pout upon the morning, are unapt
    To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
    These and these conveyances of our blood
    With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
    Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
    Till he be dieted to my request,
    And then I'll set upon him.

BRUTUS

    You know the very road into his kindness,
    And cannot lose your way.

MENENIUS

    Good faith, I'll prove him,
    Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
    Of my success.

    Exit

COMINIUS

    He'll never hear him.

SICINIUS

    Not?

COMINIUS

    I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
    Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
    The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
    'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
    Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
    He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
    Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
    So that all hope is vain.
    Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
    Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
    For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
    And with our fair entreaties haste them on.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome.

    Two Sentinels on guard.

    Enter to them, MENENIUS

First Senator

    Stay: whence are you?

Second Senator

    Stand, and go back.

MENENIUS

    You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
    I am an officer of state, and come
    To speak with Coriolanus.

First Senator

    From whence?

MENENIUS

    From Rome.

First Senator

    You may not pass, you must return: our general
    Will no more hear from thence.

Second Senator

    You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
    You'll speak with Coriolanus.

MENENIUS

    Good my friends,
    If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
    And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
    My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.

First Senator

    Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
    Is not here passable.

MENENIUS

    I tell thee, fellow,
    The general is my lover: I have been
    The book of his good acts, whence men have read
    His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
    For I have ever verified my friends,
    Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
    Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
    Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
    I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
    Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
    I must have leave to pass.

First Senator

    Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
    behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
    should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
    to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS

    Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
    always factionary on the party of your general.

Second Senator

    Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
    have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
    say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.

MENENIUS

    Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
    speak with him till after dinner.

First Senator

    You are a Roman, are you?

MENENIUS

    I am, as thy general is.

First Senator

    Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
    when you have pushed out your gates the very
    defender of them, and, in a violent popular
    ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
    front his revenges with the easy groans of old
    women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
    the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
    you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
    intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
    such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
    therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
    execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
    you out of reprieve and pardon.

MENENIUS

    Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
    use me with estimation.

Second Senator

    Come, my captain knows you not.

MENENIUS

    I mean, thy general.

First Senator

    My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
    I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
    the utmost of your having: back.

MENENIUS

    Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--

    Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS

CORIOLANUS

    What's the matter?

MENENIUS

    Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:
    You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
    perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
    my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
    with him, if thou standest not i' the state of
    hanging, or of some death more long in
    spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
    presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.

    To CORIOLANUS
    The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
    particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
    thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
    thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
    water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
    thee; but being assured none but myself could move
    thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
    sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
    petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
    wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
    here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
    access to thee.

CORIOLANUS

    Away!

MENENIUS

    How! away!

CORIOLANUS

    Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
    Are servanted to others: though I owe
    My revenge properly, my remission lies
    In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
    Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
    Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
    Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
    Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
    Take this along; I writ it for thy sake

    Gives a letter
    And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
    I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
    Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!

AUFIDIUS

    You keep a constant temper.

    Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS

First Senator

    Now, sir, is your name Menenius?

Second Senator

    'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
    way home again.

First Senator

    Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
    greatness back?

Second Senator

    What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?

MENENIUS

    I neither care for the world nor your general: for
    such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,
    ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
    himself fears it not from another: let your general
    do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and
    your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
    as I was said to, Away!

    Exit

First Senator

    A noble fellow, I warrant him.

Second Senator

    The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
    oak not to be wind-shaken.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The tent of Coriolanus.

    Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others

CORIOLANUS

    We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
    Set down our host. My partner in this action,
    You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
    I have borne this business.

AUFIDIUS

    Only their ends
    You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
    The general suit of Rome; never admitted
    A private whisper, no, not with such friends
    That thought them sure of you.

CORIOLANUS

    This last old man,
    Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
    Loved me above the measure of a father;
    Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
    Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
    Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
    The first conditions, which they did refuse
    And cannot now accept; to grace him only
    That thought he could do more, a very little
    I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
    Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
    Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?

    Shout within
    Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
    In the same time 'tis made? I will not.

    Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA, leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and Attendants
    My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
    Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
    The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
    All bond and privilege of nature, break!
    Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
    What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
    Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
    Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
    As if Olympus to a molehill should
    In supplication nod: and my young boy
    Hath an aspect of intercession, which
    Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
    Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
    Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
    As if a man were author of himself
    And knew no other kin.

VIRGILIA

    My lord and husband!

CORIOLANUS

    These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.

VIRGILIA

    The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
    Makes you think so.

CORIOLANUS

    Like a dull actor now,
    I have forgot my part, and I am out,
    Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
    Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
    For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
    Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
    Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
    I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
    Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
    And the most noble mother of the world
    Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;

    Kneels
    Of thy deep duty more impression show
    Than that of common sons.

VOLUMNIA

    O, stand up blest!
    Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
    I kneel before thee; and unproperly
    Show duty, as mistaken all this while
    Between the child and parent.

    Kneels

CORIOLANUS

    What is this?
    Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
    Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
    Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
    Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
    Murdering impossibility, to make
    What cannot be, slight work.

VOLUMNIA

    Thou art my warrior;
    I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?

CORIOLANUS

    The noble sister of Publicola,
    The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
    That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
    And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!

VOLUMNIA

    This is a poor epitome of yours,
    Which by the interpretation of full time
    May show like all yourself.

CORIOLANUS

    The god of soldiers,
    With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
    Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
    To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
    Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
    And saving those that eye thee!

VOLUMNIA

    Your knee, sirrah.

CORIOLANUS

    That's my brave boy!

VOLUMNIA

    Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
    Are suitors to you.

CORIOLANUS

    I beseech you, peace:
    Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
    The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
    Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
    Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
    Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
    Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
    To ally my rages and revenges with
    Your colder reasons.

VOLUMNIA

    O, no more, no more!
    You have said you will not grant us any thing;
    For we have nothing else to ask, but that
    Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
    That, if you fail in our request, the blame
    May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.

CORIOLANUS

    Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
    Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?

VOLUMNIA

    Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
    And state of bodies would bewray what life
    We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
    How more unfortunate than all living women
    Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
    which should
    Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
    with comforts,
    Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
    Making the mother, wife and child to see
    The son, the husband and the father tearing
    His country's bowels out. And to poor we
    Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
    Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
    That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
    Alas, how can we for our country pray.
    Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
    Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
    The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
    Our comfort in the country. We must find
    An evident calamity, though we had
    Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
    Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
    With manacles thorough our streets, or else
    triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
    And bear the palm for having bravely shed
    Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
    I purpose not to wait on fortune till
    These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
    Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
    Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
    March to assault thy country than to tread--
    Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
    That brought thee to this world.

VIRGILIA

    Ay, and mine,
    That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
    Living to time.

Young MARCIUS

    A' shall not tread on me;
    I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.

CORIOLANUS

    Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
    Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
    I have sat too long.

    Rising

VOLUMNIA

    Nay, go not from us thus.
    If it were so that our request did tend
    To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
    The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
    As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
    Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
    May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
    'This we received;' and each in either side
    Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
    For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
    The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
    That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
    Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
    Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
    Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
    But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
    Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
    To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
    Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
    To imitate the graces of the gods;
    To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
    And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
    That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
    Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
    Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
    He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
    Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
    Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
    More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
    Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
    Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
    When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
    Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
    Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
    And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
    Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
    That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
    To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
    Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
    To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
    Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
    This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
    And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
    This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
    But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
    Does reason our petition with more strength
    Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
    This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
    His wife is in Corioli and his child
    Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
    I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
    And then I'll speak a little.

    He holds her by the hand, silent

CORIOLANUS

    O mother, mother!
    What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
    The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
    They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
    You have won a happy victory to Rome;
    But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
    Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
    If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
    Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
    I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
    Were you in my stead, would you have heard
    A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?

AUFIDIUS

    I was moved withal.

CORIOLANUS

    I dare be sworn you were:
    And, sir, it is no little thing to make
    Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
    What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
    I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
    Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!

AUFIDIUS

    [Aside] I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
    thy honour
    At difference in thee: out of that I'll work
    Myself a former fortune.

    The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS

CORIOLANUS

    Ay, by and by;

    To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, & c
    But we will drink together; and you shall bear
    A better witness back than words, which we,
    On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
    Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
    To have a temple built you: all the swords
    In Italy, and her confederate arms,
    Could not have made this peace.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Rome. A public place.

    Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS

MENENIUS

    See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
    corner-stone?

SICINIUS

    Why, what of that?

MENENIUS

    If it be possible for you to displace it with your
    little finger, there is some hope the ladies of
    Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
    But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
    sentenced and stay upon execution.

SICINIUS

    Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
    condition of a man!

MENENIUS

    There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
    yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
    from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
    creeping thing.

SICINIUS

    He loved his mother dearly.

MENENIUS

    So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
    now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
    of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
    moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
    his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
    his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
    battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for
    Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
    his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
    and a heaven to throne in.

SICINIUS

    Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.

MENENIUS

    I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
    mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
    in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that
    shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
    you.

SICINIUS

    The gods be good unto us!

MENENIUS

    No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
    us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
    and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
    The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
    And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
    The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
    They'll give him death by inches.

    Enter a second Messenger

SICINIUS

    What's the news?

Second Messenger

    Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
    The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
    A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
    No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.

SICINIUS

    Friend,
    Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?

Second Messenger

    As certain as I know the sun is fire:
    Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
    Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
    As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!

    Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together
    The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
    Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
    Make the sun dance. Hark you!

    A shout within

MENENIUS

    This is good news:
    I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
    Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
    A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
    A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
    This morning for ten thousand of your throats
    I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!

    Music still, with shouts

SICINIUS

    First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
    Accept my thankfulness.

Second Messenger

    Sir, we have all
    Great cause to give great thanks.

SICINIUS

    They are near the city?

Second Messenger

    Almost at point to enter.

SICINIUS

    We will meet them,
    And help the joy.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. The same. A street near the gate.

    Enter two Senators with VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, VALERIA, & c. passing over the stage, followed by Patricians and others

First Senator

    Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
    Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
    And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
    Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
    Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
    Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'

All

    Welcome, ladies, Welcome!

    A flourish with drums and trumpets. Exeunt

SCENE VI. Antium. A public place.

    Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with Attendants

AUFIDIUS

    Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
    Deliver them this paper: having read it,
    Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
    Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
    Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
    The city ports by this hath enter'd and
    Intends to appear before the people, hoping
    To purge herself with words: dispatch.

    Exeunt Attendants

    Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction
    Most welcome!

First Conspirator

    How is it with our general?

AUFIDIUS

    Even so
    As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
    And with his charity slain.

Second Conspirator

    Most noble sir,
    If you do hold the same intent wherein
    You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
    Of your great danger.

AUFIDIUS

    Sir, I cannot tell:
    We must proceed as we do find the people.

Third Conspirator

    The people will remain uncertain whilst
    'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
    Makes the survivor heir of all.

AUFIDIUS

    I know it;
    And my pretext to strike at him admits
    A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
    Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
    He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
    Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
    He bow'd his nature, never known before
    But to be rough, unswayable and free.

Third Conspirator

    Sir, his stoutness
    When he did stand for consul, which he lost
    By lack of stooping,--

AUFIDIUS

    That I would have spoke of:
    Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
    Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
    Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
    In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
    Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
    My best and freshest men; served his designments
    In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
    Which he did end all his; and took some pride
    To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
    I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
    He waged me with his countenance, as if
    I had been mercenary.

First Conspirator

    So he did, my lord:
    The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
    When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
    For no less spoil than glory,--

AUFIDIUS

    There was it:
    For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
    At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
    As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
    Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
    And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!

    Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of the People

First Conspirator

    Your native town you enter'd like a post,
    And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
    Splitting the air with noise.

Second Conspirator

    And patient fools,
    Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
    With giving him glory.

Third Conspirator

    Therefore, at your vantage,
    Ere he express himself, or move the people
    With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
    Which we will second. When he lies along,
    After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
    His reasons with his body.

AUFIDIUS

    Say no more:
    Here come the lords.

    Enter the Lords of the city

All The Lords

    You are most welcome home.

AUFIDIUS

    I have not deserved it.
    But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
    What I have written to you?

Lords

    We have.

First Lord

    And grieve to hear't.
    What faults he made before the last, I think
    Might have found easy fines: but there to end
    Where he was to begin and give away
    The benefit of our levies, answering us
    With our own charge, making a treaty where
    There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.

AUFIDIUS

    He approaches: you shall hear him.

    Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and colours; commoners being with him

CORIOLANUS

    Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
    No more infected with my country's love
    Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
    Under your great command. You are to know
    That prosperously I have attempted and
    With bloody passage led your wars even to
    The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
    Do more than counterpoise a full third part
    The charges of the action. We have made peace
    With no less honour to the Antiates
    Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
    Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
    Together with the seal o' the senate, what
    We have compounded on.

AUFIDIUS

    Read it not, noble lords;
    But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
    He hath abused your powers.

CORIOLANUS

    Traitor! how now!

AUFIDIUS

    Ay, traitor, Marcius!

CORIOLANUS

    Marcius!

AUFIDIUS

    Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
    I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
    Coriolanus in Corioli?
    You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
    He has betray'd your business, and given up,
    For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
    I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
    Breaking his oath and resolution like
    A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
    Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
    He whined and roar'd away your victory,
    That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
    Look'd wondering each at other.

CORIOLANUS

    Hear'st thou, Mars?

AUFIDIUS

    Name not the god, thou boy of tears!

CORIOLANUS

    Ha!

AUFIDIUS

    No more.

CORIOLANUS

    Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
    Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
    Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
    I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
    Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
    Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
    Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
    To thrust the lie unto him.

First Lord

    Peace, both, and hear me speak.

CORIOLANUS

    Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
    Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
    If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
    That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
    Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
    Alone I did it. Boy!

AUFIDIUS

    Why, noble lords,
    Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
    Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
    'Fore your own eyes and ears?

All Conspirators

    Let him die for't.

All The People

    'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
    my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
    Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'

Second Lord

    Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
    The man is noble and his fame folds-in
    This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
    Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
    And trouble not the peace.

CORIOLANUS

    O that I had him,
    With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
    To use my lawful sword!

AUFIDIUS

    Insolent villain!

All Conspirators

    Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!

    The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS: AUFIDIUS stands on his body

Lords

    Hold, hold, hold, hold!

AUFIDIUS

    My noble masters, hear me speak.

First Lord

    O Tullus,--

Second Lord

    Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.

Third Lord

    Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
    Put up your swords.

AUFIDIUS

    My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
    Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
    Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
    That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
    To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
    Myself your loyal servant, or endure
    Your heaviest censure.

First Lord

    Bear from hence his body;
    And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
    As the most noble corse that ever herald
    Did follow to his urn.

Second Lord

    His own impatience
    Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
    Let's make the best of it.

AUFIDIUS

    My rage is gone;
    And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
    Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
    Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
    Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
    Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
    Which to this hour bewail the injury,
    Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.

    Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS. A dead march sounded


The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark

ACT I
SCENE I. Elsinore. A platform before the castle.

    FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO

BERNARDO

    Who's there?

FRANCISCO

    Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.

BERNARDO

    Long live the king!

FRANCISCO

    Bernardo?

BERNARDO

    He.

FRANCISCO

    You come most carefully upon your hour.

BERNARDO

    'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.

FRANCISCO

    For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
    And I am sick at heart.

BERNARDO

    Have you had quiet guard?

FRANCISCO

    Not a mouse stirring.

BERNARDO

    Well, good night.
    If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
    The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.

FRANCISCO

    I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?

    Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

HORATIO

    Friends to this ground.

MARCELLUS

    And liegemen to the Dane.

FRANCISCO

    Give you good night.

MARCELLUS

    O, farewell, honest soldier:
    Who hath relieved you?

FRANCISCO

    Bernardo has my place.
    Give you good night.

    Exit

MARCELLUS

    Holla! Bernardo!

BERNARDO

    Say,
    What, is Horatio there?

HORATIO

    A piece of him.

BERNARDO

    Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.

MARCELLUS

    What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?

BERNARDO

    I have seen nothing.

MARCELLUS

    Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
    And will not let belief take hold of him
    Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
    Therefore I have entreated him along
    With us to watch the minutes of this night;
    That if again this apparition come,
    He may approve our eyes and speak to it.

HORATIO

    Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.

BERNARDO

    Sit down awhile;
    And let us once again assail your ears,
    That are so fortified against our story
    What we have two nights seen.

HORATIO

    Well, sit we down,
    And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.

BERNARDO

    Last night of all,
    When yond same star that's westward from the pole
    Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
    Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
    The bell then beating one,--

    Enter Ghost

MARCELLUS

    Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!

BERNARDO

    In the same figure, like the king that's dead.

MARCELLUS

    Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.

BERNARDO

    Looks it not like the king? mark it, Horatio.

HORATIO

    Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.

BERNARDO

    It would be spoke to.

MARCELLUS

    Question it, Horatio.

HORATIO

    What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
    Together with that fair and warlike form
    In which the majesty of buried Denmark
    Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!

MARCELLUS

    It is offended.

BERNARDO

    See, it stalks away!

HORATIO

    Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!

    Exit Ghost

MARCELLUS

    'Tis gone, and will not answer.

BERNARDO

    How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
    Is not this something more than fantasy?
    What think you on't?

HORATIO

    Before my God, I might not this believe
    Without the sensible and true avouch
    Of mine own eyes.

MARCELLUS

    Is it not like the king?

HORATIO

    As thou art to thyself:
    Such was the very armour he had on
    When he the ambitious Norway combated;
    So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
    He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
    'Tis strange.

MARCELLUS

    Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
    With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.

HORATIO

    In what particular thought to work I know not;
    But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    This bodes some strange eruption to our state.

MARCELLUS

    Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
    Why this same strict and most observant watch
    So nightly toils the subject of the land,
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
    What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
    Who is't that can inform me?

HORATIO

    That can I;
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
    Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
    Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
    Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
    For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
    Well ratified by law and heraldry,
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
    Against the which, a moiety competent
    Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
    To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
    Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
    Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
    Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
    Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
    As it doth well appear unto our state--
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
    Is the main motive of our preparations,
    The source of this our watch and the chief head
    Of this post-haste and romage in the land.

BERNARDO

    I think it be no other but e'en so:
    Well may it sort that this portentous figure
    Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
    That was and is the question of these wars.

HORATIO

    A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
    As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
    Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
    Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
    But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!

    Re-enter Ghost
    I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
    If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
    Speak to me:
    If there be any good thing to be done,
    That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
    Speak to me:

    Cock crows
    If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
    Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
    Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
    For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
    Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.

MARCELLUS

    Shall I strike at it with my partisan?

HORATIO

    Do, if it will not stand.

BERNARDO

    'Tis here!

HORATIO

    'Tis here!

MARCELLUS

    'Tis gone!

    Exit Ghost
    We do it wrong, being so majestical,
    To offer it the show of violence;
    For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.

BERNARDO

    It was about to speak, when the cock crew.

HORATIO

    And then it started like a guilty thing
    Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
    The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
    Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
    The extravagant and erring spirit hies
    To his confine: and of the truth herein
    This present object made probation.

MARCELLUS

    It faded on the crowing of the cock.
    Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
    Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
    The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
    The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
    No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
    So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.

HORATIO

    So have I heard and do in part believe it.
    But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
    Let us impart what we have seen to-night
    Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
    This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?

MARCELLUS

    Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
    Where we shall find him most conveniently.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room of state in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants

KING CLAUDIUS

    Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
    The memory be green, and that it us befitted
    To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
    To be contracted in one brow of woe,
    Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
    That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
    Together with remembrance of ourselves.
    Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
    The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
    Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
    With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
    With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
    In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
    Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
    Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
    With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
    Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
    Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
    Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
    Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
    Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
    He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
    Importing the surrender of those lands
    Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
    To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
    Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
    Thus much the business is: we have here writ
    To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
    Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
    Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
    His further gait herein; in that the levies,
    The lists and full proportions, are all made
    Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
    You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
    Giving to you no further personal power
    To business with the king, more than the scope
    Of these delated articles allow.
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.

CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND

    In that and all things will we show our duty.

KING CLAUDIUS

    We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.

    Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
    You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
    And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
    The head is not more native to the heart,
    The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
    Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
    What wouldst thou have, Laertes?

LAERTES

    My dread lord,
    Your leave and favour to return to France;
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
    To show my duty in your coronation,
    Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
    My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?

LORD POLONIUS

    He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
    I do beseech you, give him leave to go.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--

HAMLET

    [Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.

KING CLAUDIUS

    How is it that the clouds still hang on you?

HAMLET

    Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
    Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
    Passing through nature to eternity.

HAMLET

    Ay, madam, it is common.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    If it be,
    Why seems it so particular with thee?

HAMLET

    Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
    'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
    Nor customary suits of solemn black,
    Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
    No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
    Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
    Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
    That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
    For they are actions that a man might play:
    But I have that within which passeth show;
    These but the trappings and the suits of woe.

KING CLAUDIUS

    'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
    To give these mourning duties to your father:
    But, you must know, your father lost a father;
    That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
    In filial obligation for some term
    To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
    In obstinate condolement is a course
    Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
    It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    An understanding simple and unschool'd:
    For what we know must be and is as common
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    Why should we in our peevish opposition
    Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    To reason most absurd: whose common theme
    Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
    This unprevailing woe, and think of us
    As of a father: for let the world take note,
    You are the most immediate to our throne;
    And with no less nobility of love
    Than that which dearest father bears his son,
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    In going back to school in Wittenberg,
    It is most retrograde to our desire:
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
    Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
    I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.

HAMLET

    I shall in all my best obey you, madam.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
    This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
    Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
    No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
    Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.

    Exeunt all but HAMLET

HAMLET

    O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
    Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
    Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
    His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
    How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
    Seem to me all the uses of this world!
    Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
    That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
    Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
    But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
    So excellent a king; that was, to this,
    Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
    That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
    Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
    Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
    Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
    Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
    O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
    Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
    My father's brother, but no more like my father
    Than I to Hercules: within a month:
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
    She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
    With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
    It is not nor it cannot come to good:
    But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.

    Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO

HORATIO

    Hail to your lordship!

HAMLET

    I am glad to see you well:
    Horatio,--or I do forget myself.

HORATIO

    The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.

HAMLET

    Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?

MARCELLUS

    My good lord--

HAMLET

    I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?

HORATIO

    A truant disposition, good my lord.

HAMLET

    I would not hear your enemy say so,
    Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
    To make it truster of your own report
    Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.

HORATIO

    My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.

HAMLET

    I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
    I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

HORATIO

    Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.

HAMLET

    Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
    Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
    My father!--methinks I see my father.

HORATIO

    Where, my lord?

HAMLET

    In my mind's eye, Horatio.

HORATIO

    I saw him once; he was a goodly king.

HAMLET

    He was a man, take him for all in all,
    I shall not look upon his like again.

HORATIO

    My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.

HAMLET

    Saw? who?

HORATIO

    My lord, the king your father.

HAMLET

    The king my father!

HORATIO

    Season your admiration for awhile
    With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
    Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
    This marvel to you.

HAMLET

    For God's love, let me hear.

HORATIO

    Two nights together had these gentlemen,
    Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
    In the dead vast and middle of the night,
    Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    Appears before them, and with solemn march
    Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
    In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    The apparition comes: I knew your father;
    These hands are not more like.

HAMLET

    But where was this?

MARCELLUS

    My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.

HAMLET

    Did you not speak to it?

HORATIO

    My lord, I did;
    But answer made it none: yet once methought
    It lifted up its head and did address
    Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
    And vanish'd from our sight.

HAMLET

    'Tis very strange.

HORATIO

    As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    To let you know of it.

HAMLET

    Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
    Hold you the watch to-night?

MARCELLUS BERNARDO

    We do, my lord.

HAMLET

    Arm'd, say you?

MARCELLUS BERNARDO

    Arm'd, my lord.

HAMLET

    From top to toe?

MARCELLUS BERNARDO

    My lord, from head to foot.

HAMLET

    Then saw you not his face?

HORATIO

    O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.

HAMLET

    What, look'd he frowningly?

HORATIO

    A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.

HAMLET

    Pale or red?

HORATIO

    Nay, very pale.

HAMLET

    And fix'd his eyes upon you?

HORATIO

    Most constantly.

HAMLET

    I would I had been there.

HORATIO

    It would have much amazed you.

HAMLET

    Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?

HORATIO

    While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.

MARCELLUS BERNARDO

    Longer, longer.

HORATIO

    Not when I saw't.

HAMLET

    His beard was grizzled--no?

HORATIO

    It was, as I have seen it in his life,
    A sable silver'd.

HAMLET

    I will watch to-night;
    Perchance 'twill walk again.

HORATIO

    I warrant it will.

HAMLET

    If it assume my noble father's person,
    I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
    And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
    If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
    Let it be tenable in your silence still;
    And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
    Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
    I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
    Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
    I'll visit you.

All

    Our duty to your honour.

HAMLET

    Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.

    Exeunt all but HAMLET
    My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
    I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
    Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
    Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.

    Exit

SCENE III. A room in Polonius' house.

    Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA

LAERTES

    My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
    And, sister, as the winds give benefit
    And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
    But let me hear from you.

OPHELIA

    Do you doubt that?

LAERTES

    For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
    Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
    A violet in the youth of primy nature,
    Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
    The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.

OPHELIA

    No more but so?

LAERTES

    Think it no more;
    For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
    In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
    The inward service of the mind and soul
    Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
    And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
    The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
    His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
    For he himself is subject to his birth:
    He may not, as unvalued persons do,
    Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
    The safety and health of this whole state;
    And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
    Unto the voice and yielding of that body
    Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
    It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
    As he in his particular act and place
    May give his saying deed; which is no further
    Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
    Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
    If with too credent ear you list his songs,
    Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
    To his unmaster'd importunity.
    Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
    And keep you in the rear of your affection,
    Out of the shot and danger of desire.
    The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
    If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
    Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
    The canker galls the infants of the spring,
    Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
    And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
    Contagious blastments are most imminent.
    Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
    Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.

OPHELIA

    I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
    As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
    Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
    Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
    Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
    Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
    And recks not his own rede.

LAERTES

    O, fear me not.
    I stay too long: but here my father comes.

    Enter POLONIUS
    A double blessing is a double grace,
    Occasion smiles upon a second leave.

LORD POLONIUS

    Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
    The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
    And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
    And these few precepts in thy memory
    See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
    Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
    Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
    Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
    Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
    But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
    Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
    Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
    Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
    Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
    Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
    Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
    But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
    For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
    And they in France of the best rank and station
    Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
    Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
    For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
    And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
    This above all: to thine ownself be true,
    And it must follow, as the night the day,
    Thou canst not then be false to any man.
    Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!

LAERTES

    Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    The time invites you; go; your servants tend.

LAERTES

    Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
    What I have said to you.

OPHELIA

    'Tis in my memory lock'd,
    And you yourself shall keep the key of it.

LAERTES

    Farewell.

    Exit

LORD POLONIUS

    What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?

OPHELIA

    So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.

LORD POLONIUS

    Marry, well bethought:
    'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
    Given private time to you; and you yourself
    Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
    If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
    And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
    You do not understand yourself so clearly
    As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
    What is between you? give me up the truth.

OPHELIA

    He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
    Of his affection to me.

LORD POLONIUS

    Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
    Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
    Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?

OPHELIA

    I do not know, my lord, what I should think.

LORD POLONIUS

    Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
    That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
    Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
    Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
    Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.

OPHELIA

    My lord, he hath importuned me with love
    In honourable fashion.

LORD POLONIUS

    Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.

OPHELIA

    And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
    With almost all the holy vows of heaven.

LORD POLONIUS

    Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
    When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
    Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
    Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
    Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
    You must not take for fire. From this time
    Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
    Set your entreatments at a higher rate
    Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
    Believe so much in him, that he is young
    And with a larger tether may he walk
    Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
    Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
    Not of that dye which their investments show,
    But mere implorators of unholy suits,
    Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
    The better to beguile. This is for all:
    I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
    Have you so slander any moment leisure,
    As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
    Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.

OPHELIA

    I shall obey, my lord.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The platform.

    Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS

HAMLET

    The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.

HORATIO

    It is a nipping and an eager air.

HAMLET

    What hour now?

HORATIO

    I think it lacks of twelve.

HAMLET

    No, it is struck.

HORATIO

    Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
    Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.

    A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within
    What does this mean, my lord?

HAMLET

    The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
    Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
    And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
    The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
    The triumph of his pledge.

HORATIO

    Is it a custom?

HAMLET

    Ay, marry, is't:
    But to my mind, though I am native here
    And to the manner born, it is a custom
    More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
    This heavy-headed revel east and west
    Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
    They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
    Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
    From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
    The pith and marrow of our attribute.
    So, oft it chances in particular men,
    That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
    As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
    Since nature cannot choose his origin--
    By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
    Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
    Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
    The form of plausive manners, that these men,
    Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
    Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
    Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
    As infinite as man may undergo--
    Shall in the general censure take corruption
    From that particular fault: the dram of eale
    Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
    To his own scandal.

HORATIO

    Look, my lord, it comes!

    Enter Ghost

HAMLET

    Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
    Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
    Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
    Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
    Thou comest in such a questionable shape
    That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
    King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
    Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
    Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
    Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
    Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
    Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
    To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
    That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
    Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
    Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
    So horridly to shake our disposition
    With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
    Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?

    Ghost beckons HAMLET

HORATIO

    It beckons you to go away with it,
    As if it some impartment did desire
    To you alone.

MARCELLUS

    Look, with what courteous action
    It waves you to a more removed ground:
    But do not go with it.

HORATIO

    No, by no means.

HAMLET

    It will not speak; then I will follow it.

HORATIO

    Do not, my lord.

HAMLET

    Why, what should be the fear?
    I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
    And for my soul, what can it do to that,
    Being a thing immortal as itself?
    It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.

HORATIO

    What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
    Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
    That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
    And there assume some other horrible form,
    Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
    And draw you into madness? think of it:
    The very place puts toys of desperation,
    Without more motive, into every brain
    That looks so many fathoms to the sea
    And hears it roar beneath.

HAMLET

    It waves me still.
    Go on; I'll follow thee.

MARCELLUS

    You shall not go, my lord.

HAMLET

    Hold off your hands.

HORATIO

    Be ruled; you shall not go.

HAMLET

    My fate cries out,
    And makes each petty artery in this body
    As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
    Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
    By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
    I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.

    Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET

HORATIO

    He waxes desperate with imagination.

MARCELLUS

    Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.

HORATIO

    Have after. To what issue will this come?

MARCELLUS

    Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.

HORATIO

    Heaven will direct it.

MARCELLUS

    Nay, let's follow him.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the platform.

    Enter GHOST and HAMLET

HAMLET

    Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.

Ghost

    Mark me.

HAMLET

    I will.

Ghost

    My hour is almost come,
    When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
    Must render up myself.

HAMLET

    Alas, poor ghost!

Ghost

    Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
    To what I shall unfold.

HAMLET

    Speak; I am bound to hear.

Ghost

    So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.

HAMLET

    What?

Ghost

    I am thy father's spirit,
    Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
    And for the day confined to fast in fires,
    Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
    Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
    To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
    I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
    Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
    Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
    Thy knotted and combined locks to part
    And each particular hair to stand on end,
    Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
    But this eternal blazon must not be
    To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
    If thou didst ever thy dear father love--

HAMLET

    O God!

Ghost

    Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.

HAMLET

    Murder!

Ghost

    Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
    But this most foul, strange and unnatural.

HAMLET

    Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
    As meditation or the thoughts of love,
    May sweep to my revenge.

Ghost

    I find thee apt;
    And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
    That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
    Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
    'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
    A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
    Is by a forged process of my death
    Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
    The serpent that did sting thy father's life
    Now wears his crown.

HAMLET

    O my prophetic soul! My uncle!

Ghost

    Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
    With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
    O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
    So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
    The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
    O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
    From me, whose love was of that dignity
    That it went hand in hand even with the vow
    I made to her in marriage, and to decline
    Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
    To those of mine!
    But virtue, as it never will be moved,
    Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
    So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
    Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
    And prey on garbage.
    But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
    Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
    My custom always of the afternoon,
    Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
    With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
    And in the porches of my ears did pour
    The leperous distilment; whose effect
    Holds such an enmity with blood of man
    That swift as quicksilver it courses through
    The natural gates and alleys of the body,
    And with a sudden vigour doth posset
    And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
    The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
    And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
    Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
    All my smooth body.
    Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
    Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
    Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
    Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
    No reckoning made, but sent to my account
    With all my imperfections on my head:
    O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
    If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
    Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
    A couch for luxury and damned incest.
    But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
    Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
    Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
    And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
    To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
    The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
    And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
    Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.

    Exit

HAMLET

    O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
    And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
    And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
    But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
    Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
    In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
    Yea, from the table of my memory
    I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
    That youth and observation copied there;
    And thy commandment all alone shall live
    Within the book and volume of my brain,
    Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
    O most pernicious woman!
    O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
    My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
    That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
    At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:

    Writing
    So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
    It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
    I have sworn 't.

MARCELLUS HORATIO

    [Within] My lord, my lord,--

MARCELLUS

    [Within] Lord Hamlet,--

HORATIO

    [Within] Heaven secure him!

HAMLET

    So be it!

HORATIO

    [Within] Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!

HAMLET

    Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.

    Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS

MARCELLUS

    How is't, my noble lord?

HORATIO

    What news, my lord?

HAMLET

    O, wonderful!

HORATIO

    Good my lord, tell it.

HAMLET

    No; you'll reveal it.

HORATIO

    Not I, my lord, by heaven.

MARCELLUS

    Nor I, my lord.

HAMLET

    How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
    But you'll be secret?

HORATIO MARCELLUS

    Ay, by heaven, my lord.

HAMLET

    There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
    But he's an arrant knave.

HORATIO

    There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
    To tell us this.

HAMLET

    Why, right; you are i' the right;
    And so, without more circumstance at all,
    I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
    You, as your business and desire shall point you;
    For every man has business and desire,
    Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
    Look you, I'll go pray.

HORATIO

    These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.

HAMLET

    I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
    Yes, 'faith heartily.

HORATIO

    There's no offence, my lord.

HAMLET

    Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
    And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
    It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
    For your desire to know what is between us,
    O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
    As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
    Give me one poor request.

HORATIO

    What is't, my lord? we will.

HAMLET

    Never make known what you have seen to-night.

HORATIO MARCELLUS

    My lord, we will not.

HAMLET

    Nay, but swear't.

HORATIO

    In faith,
    My lord, not I.

MARCELLUS

    Nor I, my lord, in faith.

HAMLET

    Upon my sword.

MARCELLUS

    We have sworn, my lord, already.

HAMLET

    Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.

Ghost

    [Beneath] Swear.

HAMLET

    Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
    truepenny?
    Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
    Consent to swear.

HORATIO

    Propose the oath, my lord.

HAMLET

    Never to speak of this that you have seen,
    Swear by my sword.

Ghost

    [Beneath] Swear.

HAMLET

    Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
    Come hither, gentlemen,
    And lay your hands again upon my sword:
    Never to speak of this that you have heard,
    Swear by my sword.

Ghost

    [Beneath] Swear.

HAMLET

    Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
    A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.

HORATIO

    O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!

HAMLET

    And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
    There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
    Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
    Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
    How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
    As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
    To put an antic disposition on,
    That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
    With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
    Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
    As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
    Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
    Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
    That you know aught of me: this not to do,
    So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.

Ghost

    [Beneath] Swear.

HAMLET

    Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!

    They swear
    So, gentlemen,
    With all my love I do commend me to you:
    And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
    May do, to express his love and friending to you,
    God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
    And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
    The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
    That ever I was born to set it right!
    Nay, come, let's go together.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. A room in POLONIUS' house.

    Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO

LORD POLONIUS

    Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.

REYNALDO

    I will, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
    Before you visit him, to make inquire
    Of his behavior.

REYNALDO

    My lord, I did intend it.

LORD POLONIUS

    Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
    Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
    And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
    What company, at what expense; and finding
    By this encompassment and drift of question
    That they do know my son, come you more nearer
    Than your particular demands will touch it:
    Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
    As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
    And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?

REYNALDO

    Ay, very well, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
    But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
    Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
    What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
    As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
    But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
    As are companions noted and most known
    To youth and liberty.

REYNALDO

    As gaming, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
    Drabbing: you may go so far.

REYNALDO

    My lord, that would dishonour him.

LORD POLONIUS

    'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
    You must not put another scandal on him,
    That he is open to incontinency;
    That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
    That they may seem the taints of liberty,
    The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
    A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
    Of general assault.

REYNALDO

    But, my good lord,--

LORD POLONIUS

    Wherefore should you do this?

REYNALDO

    Ay, my lord,
    I would know that.

LORD POLONIUS

    Marry, sir, here's my drift;
    And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
    You laying these slight sullies on my son,
    As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
    Your party in converse, him you would sound,
    Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
    The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
    He closes with you in this consequence;
    'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
    According to the phrase or the addition
    Of man and country.

REYNALDO

    Very good, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
    about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
    something: where did I leave?

REYNALDO

    At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
    and 'gentleman.'

LORD POLONIUS

    At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
    He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
    I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
    Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
    There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
    There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
    'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
    Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
    See you now;
    Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
    And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
    With windlasses and with assays of bias,
    By indirections find directions out:
    So by my former lecture and advice,
    Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?

REYNALDO

    My lord, I have.

LORD POLONIUS

    God be wi' you; fare you well.

REYNALDO

    Good my lord!

LORD POLONIUS

    Observe his inclination in yourself.

REYNALDO

    I shall, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    And let him ply his music.

REYNALDO

    Well, my lord.

LORD POLONIUS

    Farewell!

    Exit REYNALDO

    Enter OPHELIA
    How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?

OPHELIA

    O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!

LORD POLONIUS

    With what, i' the name of God?

OPHELIA

    My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
    Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
    No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
    Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
    Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
    And with a look so piteous in purport
    As if he had been loosed out of hell
    To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.

LORD POLONIUS

    Mad for thy love?

OPHELIA

    My lord, I do not know;
    But truly, I do fear it.

LORD POLONIUS

    What said he?

OPHELIA

    He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
    Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
    And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
    He falls to such perusal of my face
    As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
    At last, a little shaking of mine arm
    And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
    He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
    As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
    And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
    And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
    He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
    For out o' doors he went without their helps,
    And, to the last, bended their light on me.

LORD POLONIUS

    Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
    This is the very ecstasy of love,
    Whose violent property fordoes itself
    And leads the will to desperate undertakings
    As oft as any passion under heaven
    That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
    What, have you given him any hard words of late?

OPHELIA

    No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
    I did repel his fetters and denied
    His access to me.

LORD POLONIUS

    That hath made him mad.
    I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
    I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
    And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
    By heaven, it is as proper to our age
    To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
    As it is common for the younger sort
    To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
    This must be known; which, being kept close, might
    move
    More grief to hide than hate to utter love.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants

KING CLAUDIUS

    Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
    Moreover that we much did long to see you,
    The need we have to use you did provoke
    Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
    Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
    Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
    Resembles that it was. What it should be,
    More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
    So much from the understanding of himself,
    I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
    That, being of so young days brought up with him,
    And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
    That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
    Some little time: so by your companies
    To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
    So much as from occasion you may glean,
    Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
    That, open'd, lies within our remedy.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
    And sure I am two men there are not living
    To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
    To show us so much gentry and good will
    As to expend your time with us awhile,
    For the supply and profit of our hope,
    Your visitation shall receive such thanks
    As fits a king's remembrance.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Both your majesties
    Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
    Put your dread pleasures more into command
    Than to entreaty.

GUILDENSTERN

    But we both obey,
    And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
    To lay our service freely at your feet,
    To be commanded.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
    And I beseech you instantly to visit
    My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
    And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.

GUILDENSTERN

    Heavens make our presence and our practises
    Pleasant and helpful to him!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Ay, amen!

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some Attendants

    Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS

    The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
    Are joyfully return'd.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Thou still hast been the father of good news.

LORD POLONIUS

    Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
    I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
    Both to my God and to my gracious king:
    And I do think, or else this brain of mine
    Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
    As it hath used to do, that I have found
    The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.

KING CLAUDIUS

    O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.

LORD POLONIUS

    Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
    My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.

    Exit POLONIUS
    He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
    The head and source of all your son's distemper.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    I doubt it is no other but the main;
    His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Well, we shall sift him.

    Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
    Welcome, my good friends!
    Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?

VOLTIMAND

    Most fair return of greetings and desires.
    Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
    His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
    To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
    But, better look'd into, he truly found
    It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
    That so his sickness, age and impotence
    Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
    On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
    Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
    Makes vow before his uncle never more
    To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
    Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
    Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
    And his commission to employ those soldiers,
    So levied as before, against the Polack:
    With an entreaty, herein further shown,

    Giving a paper
    That it might please you to give quiet pass
    Through your dominions for this enterprise,
    On such regards of safety and allowance
    As therein are set down.

KING CLAUDIUS

    It likes us well;
    And at our more consider'd time well read,
    Answer, and think upon this business.
    Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
    Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
    Most welcome home!

    Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS

LORD POLONIUS

    This business is well ended.
    My liege, and madam, to expostulate
    What majesty should be, what duty is,
    Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
    Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
    Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
    And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
    I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
    Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
    What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
    But let that go.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    More matter, with less art.

LORD POLONIUS

    Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
    That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
    And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
    But farewell it, for I will use no art.
    Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
    That we find out the cause of this effect,
    Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
    For this effect defective comes by cause:
    Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
    I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
    Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
    Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.

    Reads
    'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
    beautified Ophelia,'--
    That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
    a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:

    Reads
    'In her excellent white bosom, these, & c.'

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Came this from Hamlet to her?

LORD POLONIUS

    Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.

    Reads
    'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
    Doubt that the sun doth move;
    Doubt truth to be a liar;
    But never doubt I love.
    'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
    I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
    I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
    'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
    this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
    This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
    And more above, hath his solicitings,
    As they fell out by time, by means and place,
    All given to mine ear.

KING CLAUDIUS

    But how hath she
    Received his love?

LORD POLONIUS

    What do you think of me?

KING CLAUDIUS

    As of a man faithful and honourable.

LORD POLONIUS

    I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
    When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
    As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
    Before my daughter told me--what might you,
    Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
    If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
    Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
    Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
    What might you think? No, I went round to work,
    And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
    'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
    This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
    That she should lock herself from his resort,
    Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
    Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
    And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
    Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
    Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
    Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
    Into the madness wherein now he raves,
    And all we mourn for.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Do you think 'tis this?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    It may be, very likely.

LORD POLONIUS

    Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
    That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
    When it proved otherwise?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Not that I know.

LORD POLONIUS

    [Pointing to his head and shoulder]
    Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
    If circumstances lead me, I will find
    Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
    Within the centre.

KING CLAUDIUS

    How may we try it further?

LORD POLONIUS

    You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
    Here in the lobby.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    So he does indeed.

LORD POLONIUS

    At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
    Be you and I behind an arras then;
    Mark the encounter: if he love her not
    And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
    Let me be no assistant for a state,
    But keep a farm and carters.

KING CLAUDIUS

    We will try it.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.

LORD POLONIUS

    Away, I do beseech you, both away:
    I'll board him presently.

    Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and Attendants

    Enter HAMLET, reading
    O, give me leave:
    How does my good Lord Hamlet?

HAMLET

    Well, God-a-mercy.

LORD POLONIUS

    Do you know me, my lord?

HAMLET

    Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.

LORD POLONIUS

    Not I, my lord.

HAMLET

    Then I would you were so honest a man.

LORD POLONIUS

    Honest, my lord!

HAMLET

    Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
    one man picked out of ten thousand.

LORD POLONIUS

    That's very true, my lord.

HAMLET

    For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
    god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?

LORD POLONIUS

    I have, my lord.

HAMLET

    Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
    blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
    Friend, look to 't.

LORD POLONIUS

    [Aside] How say you by that? Still harping on my
    daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
    was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
    truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
    love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
    What do you read, my lord?

HAMLET

    Words, words, words.

LORD POLONIUS

    What is the matter, my lord?

HAMLET

    Between who?

LORD POLONIUS

    I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.

HAMLET

    Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
    that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
    wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
    plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
    wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
    though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
    I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
    yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
    you could go backward.

LORD POLONIUS

    [Aside] Though this be madness, yet there is method
    in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?

HAMLET

    Into my grave.

LORD POLONIUS

    Indeed, that is out o' the air.

    Aside
    How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
    that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
    could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
    leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
    meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
    lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.

HAMLET

    You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
    more willingly part withal: except my life, except
    my life, except my life.

LORD POLONIUS

    Fare you well, my lord.

HAMLET

    These tedious old fools!

    Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

LORD POLONIUS

    You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.

ROSENCRANTZ

    [To POLONIUS] God save you, sir!

    Exit POLONIUS

GUILDENSTERN

    My honoured lord!

ROSENCRANTZ

    My most dear lord!

HAMLET

    My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
    Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?

ROSENCRANTZ

    As the indifferent children of the earth.

GUILDENSTERN

    Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
    On fortune's cap we are not the very button.

HAMLET

    Nor the soles of her shoe?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Neither, my lord.

HAMLET

    Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
    her favours?

GUILDENSTERN

    'Faith, her privates we.

HAMLET

    In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
    is a strumpet. What's the news?

ROSENCRANTZ

    None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.

HAMLET

    Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
    Let me question more in particular: what have you,
    my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
    that she sends you to prison hither?

GUILDENSTERN

    Prison, my lord!

HAMLET

    Denmark's a prison.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Then is the world one.

HAMLET

    A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
    wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.

ROSENCRANTZ

    We think not so, my lord.

HAMLET

    Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
    either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
    it is a prison.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
    narrow for your mind.

HAMLET

    O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
    myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
    have bad dreams.

GUILDENSTERN

    Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
    substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.

HAMLET

    A dream itself is but a shadow.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
    quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.

HAMLET

    Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
    outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
    to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.

ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN

    We'll wait upon you.

HAMLET

    No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
    of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
    man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
    beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?

ROSENCRANTZ

    To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.

HAMLET

    Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
    thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
    too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
    your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
    deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.

GUILDENSTERN

    What should we say, my lord?

HAMLET

    Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
    for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
    which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
    I know the good king and queen have sent for you.

ROSENCRANTZ

    To what end, my lord?

HAMLET

    That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
    the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
    our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
    love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
    charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
    whether you were sent for, or no?

ROSENCRANTZ

    [Aside to GUILDENSTERN] What say you?

HAMLET

    [Aside] Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
    love me, hold not off.

GUILDENSTERN

    My lord, we were sent for.

HAMLET

    I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
    prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
    and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
    wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
    custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
    with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
    earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
    excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
    o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
    with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
    me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
    What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
    how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
    express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
    in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
    world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
    what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
    me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
    you seem to say so.

ROSENCRANTZ

    My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.

HAMLET

    Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?

ROSENCRANTZ

    To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
    lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
    you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
    coming, to offer you service.

HAMLET

    He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
    shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
    shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
    sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
    in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
    lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
    say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
    for't. What players are they?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
    tragedians of the city.

HAMLET

    How chances it they travel? their residence, both
    in reputation and profit, was better both ways.

ROSENCRANTZ

    I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
    late innovation.

HAMLET

    Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
    in the city? are they so followed?

ROSENCRANTZ

    No, indeed, are they not.

HAMLET

    How comes it? do they grow rusty?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
    there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
    that cry out on the top of question, and are most
    tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
    fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
    call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
    goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.

HAMLET

    What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
    they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
    longer than they can sing? will they not say
    afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
    players--as it is most like, if their means are no
    better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
    exclaim against their own succession?

ROSENCRANTZ

    'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
    the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
    controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
    for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
    cuffs in the question.

HAMLET

    Is't possible?

GUILDENSTERN

    O, there has been much throwing about of brains.

HAMLET

    Do the boys carry it away?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.

HAMLET

    It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
    Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
    my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
    hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
    'Sblood, there is something in this more than
    natural, if philosophy could find it out.

    Flourish of trumpets within

GUILDENSTERN

    There are the players.

HAMLET

    Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
    come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
    and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
    lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
    must show fairly outward, should more appear like
    entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
    uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.

GUILDENSTERN

    In what, my dear lord?

HAMLET

    I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
    southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.

    Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS

    Well be with you, gentlemen!

HAMLET

    Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
    hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
    out of his swaddling-clouts.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
    say an old man is twice a child.

HAMLET

    I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
    mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
    'twas so indeed.

LORD POLONIUS

    My lord, I have news to tell you.

HAMLET

    My lord, I have news to tell you.
    When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--

LORD POLONIUS

    The actors are come hither, my lord.

HAMLET

    Buz, buz!

LORD POLONIUS

    Upon mine honour,--

HAMLET

    Then came each actor on his ass,--

LORD POLONIUS

    The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
    comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
    historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
    comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
    poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
    Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
    liberty, these are the only men.

HAMLET

    O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!

LORD POLONIUS

    What a treasure had he, my lord?

HAMLET

    Why,
    'One fair daughter and no more,
    The which he loved passing well.'

LORD POLONIUS

    [Aside] Still on my daughter.

HAMLET

    Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?

LORD POLONIUS

    If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
    that I love passing well.

HAMLET

    Nay, that follows not.

LORD POLONIUS

    What follows, then, my lord?

HAMLET

    Why,
    'As by lot, God wot,'
    and then, you know,
    'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
    the first row of the pious chanson will show you
    more; for look, where my abridgement comes.

    Enter four or five Players
    You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
    to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
    friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
    comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
    lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
    nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
    altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
    apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
    ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
    to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
    we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
    of your quality; come, a passionate speech.

First Player

    What speech, my lord?

HAMLET

    I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
    never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
    play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
    caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
    it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
    cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
    digested in the scenes, set down with as much
    modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
    were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
    savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
    indict the author of affectation; but called it an
    honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
    much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
    chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
    thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
    Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
    at this line: let me see, let me see--
    'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
    it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
    'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
    Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
    When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
    Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
    With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
    Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
    With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
    Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
    That lend a tyrannous and damned light
    To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
    And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
    With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
    Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
    So, proceed you.

LORD POLONIUS

    'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
    good discretion.

First Player

    'Anon he finds him
    Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
    Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
    Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
    Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
    But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
    The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
    Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
    Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
    Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
    Which was declining on the milky head
    Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
    So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
    And like a neutral to his will and matter,
    Did nothing.
    But, as we often see, against some storm,
    A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
    The bold winds speechless and the orb below
    As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
    Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
    Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
    And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
    On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
    With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
    Now falls on Priam.
    Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
    In general synod 'take away her power;
    Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
    And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
    As low as to the fiends!'

LORD POLONIUS

    This is too long.

HAMLET

    It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
    say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
    sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.

First Player

    'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'

HAMLET

    'The mobled queen?'

LORD POLONIUS

    That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.

First Player

    'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
    With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
    Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
    About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
    A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
    Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
    'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
    pronounced:
    But if the gods themselves did see her then
    When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
    In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
    The instant burst of clamour that she made,
    Unless things mortal move them not at all,
    Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
    And passion in the gods.'

LORD POLONIUS

    Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
    tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.

HAMLET

    'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
    Good my lord, will you see the players well
    bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
    they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
    time: after your death you were better have a bad
    epitaph than their ill report while you live.

LORD POLONIUS

    My lord, I will use them according to their desert.

HAMLET

    God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
    after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
    Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
    they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
    Take them in.

LORD POLONIUS

    Come, sirs.

HAMLET

    Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.

    Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First
    Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
    Murder of Gonzago?

First Player

    Ay, my lord.

HAMLET

    We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
    study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
    I would set down and insert in't, could you not?

First Player

    Ay, my lord.

HAMLET

    Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
    not.

    Exit First Player
    My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
    welcome to Elsinore.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Good my lord!

HAMLET

    Ay, so, God be wi' ye;

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Now I am alone.
    O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
    Is it not monstrous that this player here,
    But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
    Could force his soul so to his own conceit
    That from her working all his visage wann'd,
    Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
    A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
    With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
    For Hecuba!
    What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
    That he should weep for her? What would he do,
    Had he the motive and the cue for passion
    That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
    And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
    Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
    Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
    The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
    A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
    Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
    And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
    Upon whose property and most dear life
    A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
    Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
    Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
    Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
    As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
    Ha!
    'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
    But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
    To make oppression bitter, or ere this
    I should have fatted all the region kites
    With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
    Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
    O, vengeance!
    Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
    That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
    Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
    Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
    And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
    A scullion!
    Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
    That guilty creatures sitting at a play
    Have by the very cunning of the scene
    Been struck so to the soul that presently
    They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
    For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
    With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
    Play something like the murder of my father
    Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
    I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
    I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
    May be the devil: and the devil hath power
    To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
    Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
    As he is very potent with such spirits,
    Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
    More relative than this: the play 's the thing
    Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS

    And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
    Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
    Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
    With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

ROSENCRANTZ

    He does confess he feels himself distracted;
    But from what cause he will by no means speak.

GUILDENSTERN

    Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
    But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
    When we would bring him on to some confession
    Of his true state.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Did he receive you well?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Most like a gentleman.

GUILDENSTERN

    But with much forcing of his disposition.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
    Most free in his reply.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Did you assay him?
    To any pastime?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
    We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
    And there did seem in him a kind of joy
    To hear of it: they are about the court,
    And, as I think, they have already order
    This night to play before him.

LORD POLONIUS

    'Tis most true:
    And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
    To hear and see the matter.

KING CLAUDIUS

    With all my heart; and it doth much content me
    To hear him so inclined.
    Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
    And drive his purpose on to these delights.

ROSENCRANTZ

    We shall, my lord.

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS

    Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
    For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
    That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
    Affront Ophelia:
    Her father and myself, lawful espials,
    Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
    We may of their encounter frankly judge,
    And gather by him, as he is behaved,
    If 't be the affliction of his love or no
    That thus he suffers for.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    I shall obey you.
    And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
    That your good beauties be the happy cause
    Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
    Will bring him to his wonted way again,
    To both your honours.

OPHELIA

    Madam, I wish it may.

    Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE

LORD POLONIUS

    Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
    We will bestow ourselves.

    To OPHELIA
    Read on this book;
    That show of such an exercise may colour
    Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
    'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
    And pious action we do sugar o'er
    The devil himself.

KING CLAUDIUS

    [Aside] O, 'tis too true!
    How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
    The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
    Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
    Than is my deed to my most painted word:
    O heavy burthen!

LORD POLONIUS

    I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.

    Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS

    Enter HAMLET

HAMLET

    To be, or not to be: that is the question:
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
    No more; and by a sleep to say we end
    The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
    That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
    Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
    To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
    For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
    When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
    Must give us pause: there's the respect
    That makes calamity of so long life;
    For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
    The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
    The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
    The insolence of office and the spurns
    That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
    When he himself might his quietus make
    With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
    To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
    But that the dread of something after death,
    The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
    No traveller returns, puzzles the will
    And makes us rather bear those ills we have
    Than fly to others that we know not of?
    Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
    And thus the native hue of resolution
    Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
    And enterprises of great pith and moment
    With this regard their currents turn awry,
    And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
    The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
    Be all my sins remember'd.

OPHELIA

    Good my lord,
    How does your honour for this many a day?

HAMLET

    I humbly thank you; well, well, well.

OPHELIA

    My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
    That I have longed long to re-deliver;
    I pray you, now receive them.

HAMLET

    No, not I;
    I never gave you aught.

OPHELIA

    My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
    And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
    As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
    Take these again; for to the noble mind
    Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
    There, my lord.

HAMLET

    Ha, ha! are you honest?

OPHELIA

    My lord?

HAMLET

    Are you fair?

OPHELIA

    What means your lordship?

HAMLET

    That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
    admit no discourse to your beauty.

OPHELIA

    Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
    with honesty?

HAMLET

    Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
    transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
    force of honesty can translate beauty into his
    likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
    time gives it proof. I did love you once.

OPHELIA

    Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.

HAMLET

    You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
    so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
    it: I loved you not.

OPHELIA

    I was the more deceived.

HAMLET

    Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
    breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
    but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
    were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
    proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
    my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
    imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
    in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
    between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
    all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
    Where's your father?

OPHELIA

    At home, my lord.

HAMLET

    Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
    fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.

OPHELIA

    O, help him, you sweet heavens!

HAMLET

    If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
    thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
    snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
    nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
    marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
    what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
    and quickly too. Farewell.

OPHELIA

    O heavenly powers, restore him!

HAMLET

    I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
    has given you one face, and you make yourselves
    another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
    nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
    your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
    made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
    those that are married already, all but one, shall
    live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
    nunnery, go.

    Exit

OPHELIA

    O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
    The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
    The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
    The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
    The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
    And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
    That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
    Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
    Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
    That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
    Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
    To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!

    Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS

KING CLAUDIUS

    Love! his affections do not that way tend;
    Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
    Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
    O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
    And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
    Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
    I have in quick determination
    Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
    For the demand of our neglected tribute
    Haply the seas and countries different
    With variable objects shall expel
    This something-settled matter in his heart,
    Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
    From fashion of himself. What think you on't?

LORD POLONIUS

    It shall do well: but yet do I believe
    The origin and commencement of his grief
    Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
    You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
    We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
    But, if you hold it fit, after the play
    Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
    To show his grief: let her be round with him;
    And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
    Of all their conference. If she find him not,
    To England send him, or confine him where
    Your wisdom best shall think.

KING CLAUDIUS

    It shall be so:
    Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.

    Enter HAMLET and Players

HAMLET

    Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
    you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
    as many of your players do, I had as lief the
    town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
    too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
    for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
    the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
    a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
    offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
    periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
    very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
    for the most part are capable of nothing but
    inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
    a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
    out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.

First Player

    I warrant your honour.

HAMLET

    Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
    be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
    word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
    the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
    from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
    first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
    mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
    scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
    the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
    or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
    laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
    censure of the which one must in your allowance
    o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
    players that I have seen play, and heard others
    praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
    that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
    the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
    strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
    nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
    well, they imitated humanity so abominably.

First Player

    I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
    sir.

HAMLET

    O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
    your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
    for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
    set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
    too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
    question of the play be then to be considered:
    that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
    in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.

    Exeunt Players

    Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN
    How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?

LORD POLONIUS

    And the queen too, and that presently.

HAMLET

    Bid the players make haste.

    Will you two help to hasten them?

HORATIO

    Here, sweet lord, at your service.

HAMLET

    Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
    As e'er my conversation coped withal.

HORATIO

    O, my dear lord,--

HAMLET

    Nay, do not think I flatter;
    For what advancement may I hope from thee
    That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
    To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
    No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
    And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
    Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
    Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
    And could of men distinguish, her election
    Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
    As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
    A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
    Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
    Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
    That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
    To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
    That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
    In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
    As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
    There is a play to-night before the king;
    One scene of it comes near the circumstance
    Which I have told thee of my father's death:
    I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
    Even with the very comment of thy soul
    Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
    Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
    It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
    And my imaginations are as foul
    As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
    For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
    And after we will both our judgments join
    In censure of his seeming.

HORATIO

    Well, my lord:
    If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
    And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.

HAMLET

    They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
    Get you a place.

    Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others

KING CLAUDIUS

    How fares our cousin Hamlet?

HAMLET

    Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
    the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.

KING CLAUDIUS

    I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
    are not mine.

HAMLET

    No, nor mine now.

    To POLONIUS
    My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?

LORD POLONIUS

    That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.

HAMLET

    What did you enact?

LORD POLONIUS

    I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
    Capitol; Brutus killed me.

HAMLET

    It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
    there. Be the players ready?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.

HAMLET

    No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.

LORD POLONIUS

    [To KING CLAUDIUS] O, ho! do you mark that?

HAMLET

    Lady, shall I lie in your lap?

    Lying down at OPHELIA's feet

OPHELIA

    No, my lord.

HAMLET

    I mean, my head upon your lap?

OPHELIA

    Ay, my lord.

HAMLET

    Do you think I meant country matters?

OPHELIA

    I think nothing, my lord.

HAMLET

    That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.

OPHELIA

    What is, my lord?

HAMLET

    Nothing.

OPHELIA

    You are merry, my lord.

HAMLET

    Who, I?

OPHELIA

    Ay, my lord.

HAMLET

    O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
    but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
    mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.

OPHELIA

    Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

HAMLET

    So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
    I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
    months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
    hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
    a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
    then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
    the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
    the hobby-horse is forgot.'

    Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters

    Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes show of protestation unto him. He takes her up, and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep, leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner, with some two or three Mutes, comes in again, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but in the end accepts his love

    Exeunt

OPHELIA

    What means this, my lord?

HAMLET

    Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.

OPHELIA

    Belike this show imports the argument of the play.

    Enter Prologue

HAMLET

    We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
    keep counsel; they'll tell all.

OPHELIA

    Will he tell us what this show meant?

HAMLET

    Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
    ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.

OPHELIA

    You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.

Prologue

    For us, and for our tragedy,
    Here stooping to your clemency,
    We beg your hearing patiently.

    Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
    And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
    About the world have times twelve thirties been,
    Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
    Unite commutual in most sacred bands.

Player Queen

    So many journeys may the sun and moon
    Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
    But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
    So far from cheer and from your former state,
    That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
    Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
    For women's fear and love holds quantity;
    In neither aught, or in extremity.
    Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
    And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
    Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
    Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.

Player King

    'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
    My operant powers their functions leave to do:
    And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
    Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
    For husband shalt thou--

Player Queen

    O, confound the rest!
    Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
    In second husband let me be accurst!
    None wed the second but who kill'd the first.

HAMLET

    [Aside] Wormwood, wormwood.

Player Queen

    The instances that second marriage move
    Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
    A second time I kill my husband dead,
    When second husband kisses me in bed.

Player King

    I do believe you think what now you speak;
    But what we do determine oft we break.
    Purpose is but the slave to memory,
    Of violent birth, but poor validity;
    Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
    But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
    Most necessary 'tis that we forget
    To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
    What to ourselves in passion we propose,
    The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
    The violence of either grief or joy
    Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
    Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
    Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
    This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
    That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
    For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
    Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
    The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
    The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
    And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
    For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
    And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
    Directly seasons him his enemy.
    But, orderly to end where I begun,
    Our wills and fates do so contrary run
    That our devices still are overthrown;
    Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
    So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
    But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.

Player Queen

    Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
    Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
    To desperation turn my trust and hope!
    An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
    Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
    Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
    Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
    If, once a widow, ever I be wife!

HAMLET

    If she should break it now!

Player King

    'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
    My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
    The tedious day with sleep.

    Sleeps

Player Queen

    Sleep rock thy brain,
    And never come mischance between us twain!

    Exit

HAMLET

    Madam, how like you this play?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    The lady protests too much, methinks.

HAMLET

    O, but she'll keep her word.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?

HAMLET

    No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
    i' the world.

KING CLAUDIUS

    What do you call the play?

HAMLET

    The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
    is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
    the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
    anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
    that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
    touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
    withers are unwrung.

    Enter LUCIANUS
    This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.

OPHELIA

    You are as good as a chorus, my lord.

HAMLET

    I could interpret between you and your love, if I
    could see the puppets dallying.

OPHELIA

    You are keen, my lord, you are keen.

HAMLET

    It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.

OPHELIA

    Still better, and worse.

HAMLET

    So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
    pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
    'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'

LUCIANUS

    Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
    Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
    Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
    With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
    Thy natural magic and dire property,
    On wholesome life usurp immediately.

    Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears

HAMLET

    He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
    name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
    choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
    gets the love of Gonzago's wife.

OPHELIA

    The king rises.

HAMLET

    What, frighted with false fire!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    How fares my lord?

LORD POLONIUS

    Give o'er the play.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Give me some light: away!

All

    Lights, lights, lights!

    Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO

HAMLET

    Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
    The hart ungalled play;
    For some must watch, while some must sleep:
    So runs the world away.
    Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
    the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
    Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
    fellowship in a cry of players, sir?

HORATIO

    Half a share.

HAMLET

    A whole one, I.
    For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
    This realm dismantled was
    Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
    A very, very--pajock.

HORATIO

    You might have rhymed.

HAMLET

    O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
    thousand pound. Didst perceive?

HORATIO

    Very well, my lord.

HAMLET

    Upon the talk of the poisoning?

HORATIO

    I did very well note him.

HAMLET

    Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
    For if the king like not the comedy,
    Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
    Come, some music!

    Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

GUILDENSTERN

    Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.

HAMLET

    Sir, a whole history.

GUILDENSTERN

    The king, sir,--

HAMLET

    Ay, sir, what of him?

GUILDENSTERN

    Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.

HAMLET

    With drink, sir?

GUILDENSTERN

    No, my lord, rather with choler.

HAMLET

    Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
    signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
    to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
    more choler.

GUILDENSTERN

    Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
    start not so wildly from my affair.

HAMLET

    I am tame, sir: pronounce.

GUILDENSTERN

    The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
    spirit, hath sent me to you.

HAMLET

    You are welcome.

GUILDENSTERN

    Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
    breed. If it shall please you to make me a
    wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
    commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
    shall be the end of my business.

HAMLET

    Sir, I cannot.

GUILDENSTERN

    What, my lord?

HAMLET

    Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
    sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
    or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
    more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--

ROSENCRANTZ

    Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
    into amazement and admiration.

HAMLET

    O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
    is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
    admiration? Impart.

ROSENCRANTZ

    She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
    go to bed.

HAMLET

    We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
    you any further trade with us?

ROSENCRANTZ

    My lord, you once did love me.

HAMLET

    So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
    do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
    you deny your griefs to your friend.

HAMLET

    Sir, I lack advancement.

ROSENCRANTZ

    How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
    himself for your succession in Denmark?

HAMLET

    Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
    is something musty.

    Re-enter Players with recorders
    O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
    you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
    as if you would drive me into a toil?

GUILDENSTERN

    O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
    unmannerly.

HAMLET

    I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
    this pipe?

GUILDENSTERN

    My lord, I cannot.

HAMLET

    I pray you.

GUILDENSTERN

    Believe me, I cannot.

HAMLET

    I do beseech you.

GUILDENSTERN

    I know no touch of it, my lord.

HAMLET

    'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
    your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
    mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
    Look you, these are the stops.

GUILDENSTERN

    But these cannot I command to any utterance of
    harmony; I have not the skill.

HAMLET

    Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
    me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
    my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
    mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
    the top of my compass: and there is much music,
    excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
    you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
    easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
    instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
    cannot play upon me.

    Enter POLONIUS
    God bless you, sir!

LORD POLONIUS

    My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
    presently.

HAMLET

    Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?

LORD POLONIUS

    By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.

HAMLET

    Methinks it is like a weasel.

LORD POLONIUS

    It is backed like a weasel.

HAMLET

    Or like a whale?

LORD POLONIUS

    Very like a whale.

HAMLET

    Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
    me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.

LORD POLONIUS

    I will say so.

HAMLET

    By and by is easily said.

    Exit POLONIUS
    Leave me, friends.

    Exeunt all but HAMLET
    Tis now the very witching time of night,
    When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
    Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
    And do such bitter business as the day
    Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
    O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
    The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
    Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
    I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
    My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
    How in my words soever she be shent,
    To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

    Exit

SCENE III. A room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS

    I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
    To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
    I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
    And he to England shall along with you:
    The terms of our estate may not endure
    Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
    Out of his lunacies.

GUILDENSTERN

    We will ourselves provide:
    Most holy and religious fear it is
    To keep those many many bodies safe
    That live and feed upon your majesty.

ROSENCRANTZ

    The single and peculiar life is bound,
    With all the strength and armour of the mind,
    To keep itself from noyance; but much more
    That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
    The lives of many. The cease of majesty
    Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
    What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
    Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
    To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
    Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
    Each small annexment, petty consequence,
    Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
    Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
    For we will fetters put upon this fear,
    Which now goes too free-footed.

ROSENCRANTZ GUILDENSTERN

    We will haste us.

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

    Enter POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS

    My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
    Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
    To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
    And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
    'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
    Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
    The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
    I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
    And tell you what I know.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Thanks, dear my lord.

    Exit POLONIUS
    O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
    It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
    A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
    Though inclination be as sharp as will:
    My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
    And, like a man to double business bound,
    I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
    And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
    Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
    Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
    To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
    But to confront the visage of offence?
    And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
    To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
    Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
    My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
    Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
    That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
    Of those effects for which I did the murder,
    My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
    May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
    In the corrupted currents of this world
    Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
    And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
    Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
    There is no shuffling, there the action lies
    In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
    Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
    To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
    Try what repentance can: what can it not?
    Yet what can it when one can not repent?
    O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
    O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
    Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
    Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
    Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
    All may be well.

    Retires and kneels

    Enter HAMLET

HAMLET

    Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
    And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
    And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
    A villain kills my father; and for that,
    I, his sole son, do this same villain send
    To heaven.
    O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
    He took my father grossly, full of bread;
    With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
    And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
    But in our circumstance and course of thought,
    'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
    To take him in the purging of his soul,
    When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
    No!
    Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
    When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
    Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
    At gaming, swearing, or about some act
    That has no relish of salvation in't;
    Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
    And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
    As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
    This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.

    Exit

KING CLAUDIUS

    [Rising] My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:
    Words without thoughts never to heaven go.

    Exit

SCENE IV. The Queen's closet.

    Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE and POLONIUS

LORD POLONIUS

    He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
    Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
    And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
    Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
    Pray you, be round with him.

HAMLET

    [Within] Mother, mother, mother!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    I'll warrant you,
    Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.

    POLONIUS hides behind the arras

    Enter HAMLET

HAMLET

    Now, mother, what's the matter?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.

HAMLET

    Mother, you have my father much offended.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.

HAMLET

    Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Why, how now, Hamlet!

HAMLET

    What's the matter now?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Have you forgot me?

HAMLET

    No, by the rood, not so:
    You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
    And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.

HAMLET

    Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
    You go not till I set you up a glass
    Where you may see the inmost part of you.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
    Help, help, ho!

LORD POLONIUS

    [Behind] What, ho! help, help, help!

HAMLET

    [Drawing] How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!

    Makes a pass through the arras

LORD POLONIUS

    [Behind] O, I am slain!

    Falls and dies

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O me, what hast thou done?

HAMLET

    Nay, I know not:
    Is it the king?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

HAMLET

    A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
    As kill a king, and marry with his brother.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    As kill a king!

HAMLET

    Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

    Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS
    Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
    I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
    Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
    Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
    And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
    If it be made of penetrable stuff,
    If damned custom have not brass'd it so
    That it is proof and bulwark against sense.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
    In noise so rude against me?

HAMLET

    Such an act
    That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
    Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
    From the fair forehead of an innocent love
    And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
    As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
    As from the body of contraction plucks
    The very soul, and sweet religion makes
    A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
    Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
    With tristful visage, as against the doom,
    Is thought-sick at the act.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Ay me, what act,
    That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?

HAMLET

    Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
    The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
    See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
    Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
    An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
    A station like the herald Mercury
    New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
    A combination and a form indeed,
    Where every god did seem to set his seal,
    To give the world assurance of a man:
    This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
    Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
    Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
    Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
    And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
    You cannot call it love; for at your age
    The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
    And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
    Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
    Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
    Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
    Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
    But it reserved some quantity of choice,
    To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
    That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
    Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
    Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
    Or but a sickly part of one true sense
    Could not so mope.
    O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
    If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
    To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
    And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
    When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
    Since frost itself as actively doth burn
    And reason panders will.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O Hamlet, speak no more:
    Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
    And there I see such black and grained spots
    As will not leave their tinct.

HAMLET

    Nay, but to live
    In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
    Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
    Over the nasty sty,--

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O, speak to me no more;
    These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
    No more, sweet Hamlet!

HAMLET

    A murderer and a villain;
    A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
    Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
    A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
    That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
    And put it in his pocket!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    No more!

HAMLET

    A king of shreds and patches,--

    Enter Ghost
    Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
    You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alas, he's mad!

HAMLET

    Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
    That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
    The important acting of your dread command? O, say!

Ghost

    Do not forget: this visitation
    Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
    But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
    O, step between her and her fighting soul:
    Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
    Speak to her, Hamlet.

HAMLET

    How is it with you, lady?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alas, how is't with you,
    That you do bend your eye on vacancy
    And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
    Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
    And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
    Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
    Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
    Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
    Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?

HAMLET

    On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
    His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
    Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
    Lest with this piteous action you convert
    My stern effects: then what I have to do
    Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    To whom do you speak this?

HAMLET

    Do you see nothing there?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.

HAMLET

    Nor did you nothing hear?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    No, nothing but ourselves.

HAMLET

    Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
    My father, in his habit as he lived!
    Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!

    Exit Ghost

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    This the very coinage of your brain:
    This bodiless creation ecstasy
    Is very cunning in.

HAMLET

    Ecstasy!
    My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
    And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
    That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
    And I the matter will re-word; which madness
    Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
    Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
    That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
    It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
    Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
    Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
    Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
    And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
    To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
    For in the fatness of these pursy times
    Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
    Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

HAMLET

    O, throw away the worser part of it,
    And live the purer with the other half.
    Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
    Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
    That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
    Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
    That to the use of actions fair and good
    He likewise gives a frock or livery,
    That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
    And that shall lend a kind of easiness
    To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
    For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
    And either [ ] the devil, or throw him out
    With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
    And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
    I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,

    Pointing to POLONIUS
    I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
    To punish me with this and this with me,
    That I must be their scourge and minister.
    I will bestow him, and will answer well
    The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
    I must be cruel, only to be kind:
    Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
    One word more, good lady.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    What shall I do?

HAMLET

    Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
    Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
    Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
    And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
    Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
    Make you to ravel all this matter out,
    That I essentially am not in madness,
    But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
    For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
    Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
    Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
    No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
    Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
    Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
    To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
    And break your own neck down.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
    And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
    What thou hast said to me.

HAMLET

    I must to England; you know that?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alack,
    I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.

HAMLET

    There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
    Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
    They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
    And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
    For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
    Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
    But I will delve one yard below their mines,
    And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
    When in one line two crafts directly meet.
    This man shall set me packing:
    I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
    Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
    Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
    Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
    Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
    Good night, mother.

    Exeunt severally; HAMLET dragging in POLONIUS

ACT IV
SCENE I. A room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS

    There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
    You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
    Where is your son?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Bestow this place on us a little while.

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!

KING CLAUDIUS

    What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
    Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
    Behind the arras hearing something stir,
    Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
    And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
    The unseen good old man.

KING CLAUDIUS

    O heavy deed!
    It had been so with us, had we been there:
    His liberty is full of threats to all;
    To you yourself, to us, to every one.
    Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
    It will be laid to us, whose providence
    Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
    This mad young man: but so much was our love,
    We would not understand what was most fit;
    But, like the owner of a foul disease,
    To keep it from divulging, let it feed
    Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
    O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
    Among a mineral of metals base,
    Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.

KING CLAUDIUS

    O Gertrude, come away!
    The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
    But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
    We must, with all our majesty and skill,
    Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!

    Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
    Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
    And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
    Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
    Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
    And let them know, both what we mean to do,
    And what's untimely done. O, come away!
    My soul is full of discord and dismay.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Another room in the castle.

    Enter HAMLET

HAMLET

    Safely stowed.

ROSENCRANTZ: GUILDENSTERN:

    [Within] Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

HAMLET

    What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
    O, here they come.

    Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN

ROSENCRANTZ

    What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?

HAMLET

    Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
    And bear it to the chapel.

HAMLET

    Do not believe it.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Believe what?

HAMLET

    That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
    Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
    replication should be made by the son of a king?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

HAMLET

    Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
    rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
    king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
    an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
    be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
    gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
    shall be dry again.

ROSENCRANTZ

    I understand you not, my lord.

HAMLET

    I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
    foolish ear.

ROSENCRANTZ

    My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
    with us to the king.

HAMLET

    The body is with the king, but the king is not with
    the body. The king is a thing--

GUILDENSTERN

    A thing, my lord!

HAMLET

    Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Another room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended

KING CLAUDIUS

    I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
    How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
    Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
    He's loved of the distracted multitude,
    Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
    And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
    But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
    This sudden sending him away must seem
    Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
    By desperate appliance are relieved,
    Or not at all.

    Enter ROSENCRANTZ
    How now! what hath befall'n?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
    We cannot get from him.

KING CLAUDIUS

    But where is he?

ROSENCRANTZ

    Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Bring him before us.

ROSENCRANTZ

    Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.

    Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN

KING CLAUDIUS

    Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?

HAMLET

    At supper.

KING CLAUDIUS

    At supper! where?

HAMLET

    Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
    convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
    worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
    creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
    maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
    variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
    that's the end.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Alas, alas!

HAMLET

    A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
    king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.

KING CLAUDIUS

    What dost you mean by this?

HAMLET

    Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
    progress through the guts of a beggar.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Where is Polonius?

HAMLET

    In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
    find him not there, seek him i' the other place
    yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
    this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
    stairs into the lobby.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Go seek him there.

    To some Attendants

HAMLET

    He will stay till ye come.

    Exeunt Attendants

KING CLAUDIUS

    Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
    Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
    For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
    With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
    The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
    The associates tend, and every thing is bent
    For England.

HAMLET

    For England!

KING CLAUDIUS

    Ay, Hamlet.

HAMLET

    Good.

KING CLAUDIUS

    So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.

HAMLET

    I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
    England! Farewell, dear mother.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Thy loving father, Hamlet.

HAMLET

    My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
    and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!

    Exit

KING CLAUDIUS

    Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
    Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
    Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
    That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.

    Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN
    And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
    As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
    Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
    After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
    Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
    Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
    By letters congruing to that effect,
    The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
    For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
    And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
    Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.

    Exit

SCENE IV. A plain in Denmark.

    Enter FORTINBRAS, a Captain, and Soldiers, marching

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;
    Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
    Craves the conveyance of a promised march
    Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
    If that his majesty would aught with us,
    We shall express our duty in his eye;
    And let him know so.

Captain

    I will do't, my lord.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Go softly on.

    Exeunt FORTINBRAS and Soldiers

    Enter HAMLET, ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and others

HAMLET

    Good sir, whose powers are these?

Captain

    They are of Norway, sir.

HAMLET

    How purposed, sir, I pray you?

Captain

    Against some part of Poland.

HAMLET

    Who commands them, sir?

Captain

    The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.

HAMLET

    Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
    Or for some frontier?

Captain

    Truly to speak, and with no addition,
    We go to gain a little patch of ground
    That hath in it no profit but the name.
    To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
    Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
    A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

HAMLET

    Why, then the Polack never will defend it.

Captain

    Yes, it is already garrison'd.

HAMLET

    Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
    Will not debate the question of this straw:
    This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
    That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
    Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.

Captain

    God be wi' you, sir.

    Exit

ROSENCRANTZ

    Wilt please you go, my lord?

HAMLET

    I'll be with you straight go a little before.

    Exeunt all except HAMLET
    How all occasions do inform against me,
    And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
    If his chief good and market of his time
    Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
    Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
    Looking before and after, gave us not
    That capability and god-like reason
    To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
    Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
    Of thinking too precisely on the event,
    A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
    And ever three parts coward, I do not know
    Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
    Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
    To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
    Witness this army of such mass and charge
    Led by a delicate and tender prince,
    Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
    Makes mouths at the invisible event,
    Exposing what is mortal and unsure
    To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
    Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
    Is not to stir without great argument,
    But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
    When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
    That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
    Excitements of my reason and my blood,
    And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
    The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
    That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
    Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
    Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
    Which is not tomb enough and continent
    To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
    My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

    Exit

SCENE V. Elsinore. A room in the castle.

    Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    I will not speak with her.

Gentleman

    She is importunate, indeed distract:
    Her mood will needs be pitied.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    What would she have?

Gentleman

    She speaks much of her father; says she hears
    There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
    Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
    That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
    Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
    The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
    And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
    Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
    yield them,
    Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
    Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

HORATIO

    'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
    Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Let her come in.

    Exit HORATIO
    To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
    Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
    So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
    It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

    Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA

OPHELIA

    Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    How now, Ophelia!

OPHELIA

    [Sings]
    How should I your true love know
    From another one?
    By his cockle hat and staff,
    And his sandal shoon.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?

OPHELIA

    Say you? nay, pray you, mark.

    Sings
    He is dead and gone, lady,
    He is dead and gone;
    At his head a grass-green turf,
    At his heels a stone.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Nay, but, Ophelia,--

OPHELIA

    Pray you, mark.

    Sings
    White his shroud as the mountain snow,--

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alas, look here, my lord.

OPHELIA

    [Sings]
    Larded with sweet flowers
    Which bewept to the grave did go
    With true-love showers.

KING CLAUDIUS

    How do you, pretty lady?

OPHELIA

    Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
    daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
    what we may be. God be at your table!

KING CLAUDIUS

    Conceit upon her father.

OPHELIA

    Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
    ask you what it means, say you this:

    Sings
    To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
    All in the morning betime,
    And I a maid at your window,
    To be your Valentine.
    Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
    And dupp'd the chamber-door;
    Let in the maid, that out a maid
    Never departed more.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Pretty Ophelia!

OPHELIA

    Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:

    Sings
    By Gis and by Saint Charity,
    Alack, and fie for shame!
    Young men will do't, if they come to't;
    By cock, they are to blame.
    Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
    You promised me to wed.
    So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
    An thou hadst not come to my bed.

KING CLAUDIUS

    How long hath she been thus?

OPHELIA

    I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
    cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him
    i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
    and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
    coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
    good night, good night.

    Exit

KING CLAUDIUS

    Follow her close; give her good watch,
    I pray you.

    Exit HORATIO
    O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
    All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
    When sorrows come, they come not single spies
    But in battalions. First, her father slain:
    Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
    Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
    Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
    For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
    In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
    Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
    Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
    Last, and as much containing as all these,
    Her brother is in secret come from France;
    Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
    And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
    With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
    Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
    Will nothing stick our person to arraign
    In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
    Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
    Gives me superfluous death.

    A noise within

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Alack, what noise is this?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.

    Enter another Gentleman
    What is the matter?

Gentleman

    Save yourself, my lord:
    The ocean, overpeering of his list,
    Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
    Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
    O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
    And, as the world were now but to begin,
    Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
    The ratifiers and props of every word,
    They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
    Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
    'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
    O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!

KING CLAUDIUS

    The doors are broke.

    Noise within

    Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following

LAERTES

    Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.

Danes

    No, let's come in.

LAERTES

    I pray you, give me leave.

Danes

    We will, we will.

    They retire without the door

LAERTES

    I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
    Give me my father!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Calmly, good Laertes.

LAERTES

    That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
    Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
    Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
    Of my true mother.

KING CLAUDIUS

    What is the cause, Laertes,
    That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
    Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
    There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
    That treason can but peep to what it would,
    Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
    Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
    Speak, man.

LAERTES

    Where is my father?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Dead.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    But not by him.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Let him demand his fill.

LAERTES

    How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
    To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
    Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
    I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
    That both the worlds I give to negligence,
    Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
    Most thoroughly for my father.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Who shall stay you?

LAERTES

    My will, not all the world:
    And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
    They shall go far with little.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Good Laertes,
    If you desire to know the certainty
    Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
    That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
    Winner and loser?

LAERTES

    None but his enemies.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Will you know them then?

LAERTES

    To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
    And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
    Repast them with my blood.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Why, now you speak
    Like a good child and a true gentleman.
    That I am guiltless of your father's death,
    And am most sensible in grief for it,
    It shall as level to your judgment pierce
    As day does to your eye.

Danes

    [Within] Let her come in.

LAERTES

    How now! what noise is that?

    Re-enter OPHELIA
    O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
    Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
    By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
    Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
    Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
    O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
    Should be as moral as an old man's life?
    Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
    It sends some precious instance of itself
    After the thing it loves.

OPHELIA

    [Sings]
    They bore him barefaced on the bier;
    Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
    And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
    Fare you well, my dove!

LAERTES

    Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
    It could not move thus.

OPHELIA

    [Sings]
    You must sing a-down a-down,
    An you call him a-down-a.
    O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
    steward, that stole his master's daughter.

LAERTES

    This nothing's more than matter.

OPHELIA

    There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
    love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.

LAERTES

    A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.

OPHELIA

    There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
    for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
    herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
    a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
    some violets, but they withered all when my father
    died: they say he made a good end,--

    Sings
    For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.

LAERTES

    Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
    She turns to favour and to prettiness.

OPHELIA

    [Sings]
    And will he not come again?
    And will he not come again?
    No, no, he is dead:
    Go to thy death-bed:
    He never will come again.
    His beard was as white as snow,
    All flaxen was his poll:
    He is gone, he is gone,
    And we cast away moan:
    God ha' mercy on his soul!
    And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.

    Exit

LAERTES

    Do you see this, O God?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
    Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
    Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
    And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
    If by direct or by collateral hand
    They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
    Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
    To you in satisfaction; but if not,
    Be you content to lend your patience to us,
    And we shall jointly labour with your soul
    To give it due content.

LAERTES

    Let this be so;
    His means of death, his obscure funeral--
    No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
    No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
    Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
    That I must call't in question.

KING CLAUDIUS

    So you shall;
    And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
    I pray you, go with me.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Another room in the castle.

    Enter HORATIO and a Servant

HORATIO

    What are they that would speak with me?

Servant

    Sailors, sir: they say they have letters for you.

HORATIO

    Let them come in.

    Exit Servant
    I do not know from what part of the world
    I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet.

    Enter Sailors

First Sailor

    God bless you, sir.

HORATIO

    Let him bless thee too.

First Sailor

    He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
    you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was
    bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am
    let to know it is.

HORATIO

    [Reads] 'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
    this, give these fellows some means to the king:
    they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
    at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
    chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
    a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
    them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
    I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
    me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
    did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
    have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
    with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
    have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
    dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
    the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
    where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
    course for England: of them I have much to tell
    thee. Farewell.
    'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
    Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
    And do't the speedier, that you may direct me
    To him from whom you brought them.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. Another room in the castle.

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES

KING CLAUDIUS

    Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
    And you must put me in your heart for friend,
    Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
    That he which hath your noble father slain
    Pursued my life.

LAERTES

    It well appears: but tell me
    Why you proceeded not against these feats,
    So crimeful and so capital in nature,
    As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
    You mainly were stirr'd up.

KING CLAUDIUS

    O, for two special reasons;
    Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
    But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
    Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
    My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
    She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
    That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
    I could not but by her. The other motive,
    Why to a public count I might not go,
    Is the great love the general gender bear him;
    Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
    Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
    Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
    Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
    Would have reverted to my bow again,
    And not where I had aim'd them.

LAERTES

    And so have I a noble father lost;
    A sister driven into desperate terms,
    Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
    Stood challenger on mount of all the age
    For her perfections: but my revenge will come.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
    That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
    That we can let our beard be shook with danger
    And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
    I loved your father, and we love ourself;
    And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--

    Enter a Messenger
    How now! what news?

Messenger

    Letters, my lord, from Hamlet:
    This to your majesty; this to the queen.

KING CLAUDIUS

    From Hamlet! who brought them?

Messenger

    Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
    They were given me by Claudio; he received them
    Of him that brought them.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Laertes, you shall hear them. Leave us.

    Exit Messenger

    Reads
    'High and mighty, You shall know I am set naked on
    your kingdom. To-morrow shall I beg leave to see
    your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your
    pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
    and more strange return. 'HAMLET.'
    What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
    Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?

LAERTES

    Know you the hand?

KING CLAUDIUS

    'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
    And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
    Can you advise me?

LAERTES

    I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
    It warms the very sickness in my heart,
    That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
    'Thus didest thou.'

KING CLAUDIUS

    If it be so, Laertes--
    As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
    Will you be ruled by me?

LAERTES

    Ay, my lord;
    So you will not o'errule me to a peace.

KING CLAUDIUS

    To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
    As checking at his voyage, and that he means
    No more to undertake it, I will work him
    To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
    Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
    And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
    But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
    And call it accident.

LAERTES

    My lord, I will be ruled;
    The rather, if you could devise it so
    That I might be the organ.

KING CLAUDIUS

    It falls right.
    You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
    And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
    Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
    Did not together pluck such envy from him
    As did that one, and that, in my regard,
    Of the unworthiest siege.

LAERTES

    What part is that, my lord?

KING CLAUDIUS

    A very riband in the cap of youth,
    Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
    The light and careless livery that it wears
    Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
    Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
    Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
    I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
    And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
    Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
    And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
    As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
    With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
    That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
    Come short of what he did.

LAERTES

    A Norman was't?

KING CLAUDIUS

    A Norman.

LAERTES

    Upon my life, Lamond.

KING CLAUDIUS

    The very same.

LAERTES

    I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
    And gem of all the nation.

KING CLAUDIUS

    He made confession of you,
    And gave you such a masterly report
    For art and exercise in your defence
    And for your rapier most especially,
    That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
    If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
    He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
    If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
    Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
    That he could nothing do but wish and beg
    Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
    Now, out of this,--

LAERTES

    What out of this, my lord?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Laertes, was your father dear to you?
    Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
    A face without a heart?

LAERTES

    Why ask you this?

KING CLAUDIUS

    Not that I think you did not love your father;
    But that I know love is begun by time;
    And that I see, in passages of proof,
    Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
    There lives within the very flame of love
    A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
    And nothing is at a like goodness still;
    For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
    Dies in his own too much: that we would do
    We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
    And hath abatements and delays as many
    As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
    And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
    That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
    Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
    To show yourself your father's son in deed
    More than in words?

LAERTES

    To cut his throat i' the church.

KING CLAUDIUS

    No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
    Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
    Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
    Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
    We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
    And set a double varnish on the fame
    The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
    And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
    Most generous and free from all contriving,
    Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
    Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
    A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
    Requite him for your father.

LAERTES

    I will do't:
    And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
    I bought an unction of a mountebank,
    So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
    Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
    Collected from all simples that have virtue
    Under the moon, can save the thing from death
    That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
    With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
    It may be death.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Let's further think of this;
    Weigh what convenience both of time and means
    May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
    And that our drift look through our bad performance,
    'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
    Should have a back or second, that might hold,
    If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
    We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
    When in your motion you are hot and dry--
    As make your bouts more violent to that end--
    And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
    A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
    If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
    Our purpose may hold there.

    Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE
    How now, sweet queen!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
    So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.

LAERTES

    Drown'd! O, where?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
    That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
    There with fantastic garlands did she come
    Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
    That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
    But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
    There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
    Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
    When down her weedy trophies and herself
    Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
    And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
    Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
    As one incapable of her own distress,
    Or like a creature native and indued
    Unto that element: but long it could not be
    Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
    Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
    To muddy death.

LAERTES

    Alas, then, she is drown'd?

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Drown'd, drown'd.

LAERTES

    Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
    And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
    It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
    Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
    The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
    I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
    But that this folly douts it.

    Exit

KING CLAUDIUS

    Let's follow, Gertrude:
    How much I had to do to calm his rage!
    Now fear I this will give it start again;
    Therefore let's follow.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. A churchyard.

    Enter two Clowns, with spades, & c

First Clown

    Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
    wilfully seeks her own salvation?

Second Clown

    I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
    straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
    Christian burial.

First Clown

    How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
    own defence?

Second Clown

    Why, 'tis found so.

First Clown

    It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
    here lies the point: if I drown myself wittingly,
    it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
    is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
    herself wittingly.

Second Clown

    Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--

First Clown

    Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
    stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
    and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
    goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
    and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
    that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.

Second Clown

    But is this law?

First Clown

    Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.

Second Clown

    Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
    a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
    Christian burial.

First Clown

    Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
    great folk should have countenance in this world to
    drown or hang themselves, more than their even
    Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
    gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
    they hold up Adam's profession.

Second Clown

    Was he a gentleman?

First Clown

    He was the first that ever bore arms.

Second Clown

    Why, he had none.

First Clown

    What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
    Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
    could he dig without arms? I'll put another
    question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
    purpose, confess thyself--

Second Clown

    Go to.

First Clown

    What is he that builds stronger than either the
    mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?

Second Clown

    The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
    thousand tenants.

First Clown

    I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
    does well; but how does it well? it does well to
    those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
    gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
    the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.

Second Clown

    'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
    a carpenter?'

First Clown

    Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.

Second Clown

    Marry, now I can tell.

First Clown

    To't.

Second Clown

    Mass, I cannot tell.

    Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance

First Clown

    Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
    ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
    you are asked this question next, say 'a
    grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
    doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
    stoup of liquor.

    Exit Second Clown

    He digs and sings
    In youth, when I did love, did love,
    Methought it was very sweet,
    To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
    O, methought, there was nothing meet.

HAMLET

    Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
    sings at grave-making?

HORATIO

    Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.

HAMLET

    'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
    the daintier sense.

First Clown

    [Sings]
    But age, with his stealing steps,
    Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
    And hath shipped me intil the land,
    As if I had never been such.

    Throws up a skull

HAMLET

    That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
    how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
    Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
    might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
    now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
    might it not?

HORATIO

    It might, my lord.

HAMLET

    Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
    sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
    be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
    such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?

HORATIO

    Ay, my lord.

HAMLET

    Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
    knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
    here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
    see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
    but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.

First Clown

    [Sings]
    A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
    For and a shrouding sheet:
    O, a pit of clay for to be made
    For such a guest is meet.

    Throws up another skull

HAMLET

    There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
    lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
    his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
    suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
    sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
    his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
    in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
    his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
    his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
    the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
    pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
    no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
    the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
    very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
    this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?

HORATIO

    Not a jot more, my lord.

HAMLET

    Is not parchment made of sheepskins?

HORATIO

    Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.

HAMLET

    They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
    in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
    grave's this, sirrah?

First Clown

    Mine, sir.

    Sings
    O, a pit of clay for to be made
    For such a guest is meet.

HAMLET

    I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.

First Clown

    You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
    yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.

HAMLET

    'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
    'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.

First Clown

    'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
    you.

HAMLET

    What man dost thou dig it for?

First Clown

    For no man, sir.

HAMLET

    What woman, then?

First Clown

    For none, neither.

HAMLET

    Who is to be buried in't?

First Clown

    One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.

HAMLET

    How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
    card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
    Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
    it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
    peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
    gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
    grave-maker?

First Clown

    Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
    that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.

HAMLET

    How long is that since?

First Clown

    Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
    was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
    is mad, and sent into England.

HAMLET

    Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?

First Clown

    Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
    there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.

HAMLET

    Why?

First Clown

    'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
    are as mad as he.

HAMLET

    How came he mad?

First Clown

    Very strangely, they say.

HAMLET

    How strangely?

First Clown

    Faith, e'en with losing his wits.

HAMLET

    Upon what ground?

First Clown

    Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
    and boy, thirty years.

HAMLET

    How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?

First Clown

    I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
    have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
    hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
    or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.

HAMLET

    Why he more than another?

First Clown

    Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
    he will keep out water a great while; and your water
    is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
    Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
    three and twenty years.

HAMLET

    Whose was it?

First Clown

    A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?

HAMLET

    Nay, I know not.

First Clown

    A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
    flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
    sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.

HAMLET

    This?

First Clown

    E'en that.

HAMLET

    Let me see.

    Takes the skull
    Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
    of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
    borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
    abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
    it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
    not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
    gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
    that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
    now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
    Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
    her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
    come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
    me one thing.

HORATIO

    What's that, my lord?

HAMLET

    Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
    the earth?

HORATIO

    E'en so.

HAMLET

    And smelt so? pah!

    Puts down the skull

HORATIO

    E'en so, my lord.

HAMLET

    To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
    not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
    till he find it stopping a bung-hole?

HORATIO

    'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.

HAMLET

    No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
    modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
    thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
    Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
    earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
    was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
    Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
    Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
    O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
    Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
    But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.

    Enter Priest, & c. in procession; the Corpse of OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, & c
    The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
    And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
    The corse they follow did with desperate hand
    Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
    Couch we awhile, and mark.

    Retiring with HORATIO

LAERTES

    What ceremony else?

HAMLET

    That is Laertes,
    A very noble youth: mark.

LAERTES

    What ceremony else?

First Priest

    Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
    As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
    And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
    She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
    Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
    Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
    Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
    Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
    Of bell and burial.

LAERTES

    Must there no more be done?

First Priest

    No more be done:
    We should profane the service of the dead
    To sing a requiem and such rest to her
    As to peace-parted souls.

LAERTES

    Lay her i' the earth:
    And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
    May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
    A ministering angel shall my sister be,
    When thou liest howling.

HAMLET

    What, the fair Ophelia!

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Sweets to the sweet: farewell!

    Scattering flowers
    I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
    I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
    And not have strew'd thy grave.

LAERTES

    O, treble woe
    Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
    Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
    Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
    Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:

    Leaps into the grave
    Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
    Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
    To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
    Of blue Olympus.

HAMLET

    [Advancing] What is he whose grief
    Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
    Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
    Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
    Hamlet the Dane.

    Leaps into the grave

LAERTES

    The devil take thy soul!

    Grappling with him

HAMLET

    Thou pray'st not well.
    I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
    For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
    Yet have I something in me dangerous,
    Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Pluck them asunder.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Hamlet, Hamlet!

All

    Gentlemen,--

HORATIO

    Good my lord, be quiet.

    The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave

HAMLET

    Why I will fight with him upon this theme
    Until my eyelids will no longer wag.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    O my son, what theme?

HAMLET

    I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
    Could not, with all their quantity of love,
    Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?

KING CLAUDIUS

    O, he is mad, Laertes.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    For love of God, forbear him.

HAMLET

    'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
    Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
    Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
    I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
    To outface me with leaping in her grave?
    Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
    And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
    Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
    Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
    Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
    I'll rant as well as thou.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    This is mere madness:
    And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
    Anon, as patient as the female dove,
    When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
    His silence will sit drooping.

HAMLET

    Hear you, sir;
    What is the reason that you use me thus?
    I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
    Let Hercules himself do what he may,
    The cat will mew and dog will have his day.

    Exit

KING CLAUDIUS

    I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.

    Exit HORATIO

    To LAERTES
    Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
    We'll put the matter to the present push.
    Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
    This grave shall have a living monument:
    An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
    Till then, in patience our proceeding be.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A hall in the castle.

    Enter HAMLET and HORATIO

HAMLET

    So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
    You do remember all the circumstance?

HORATIO

    Remember it, my lord?

HAMLET

    Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
    That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
    Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
    And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
    Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
    When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
    There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
    Rough-hew them how we will,--

HORATIO

    That is most certain.

HAMLET

    Up from my cabin,
    My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
    Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
    Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
    To mine own room again; making so bold,
    My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
    Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
    O royal knavery!--an exact command,
    Larded with many several sorts of reasons
    Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
    With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
    That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
    No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
    My head should be struck off.

HORATIO

    Is't possible?

HAMLET

    Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
    But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?

HORATIO

    I beseech you.

HAMLET

    Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
    Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
    They had begun the play--I sat me down,
    Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
    I once did hold it, as our statists do,
    A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
    How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
    It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
    The effect of what I wrote?

HORATIO

    Ay, good my lord.

HAMLET

    An earnest conjuration from the king,
    As England was his faithful tributary,
    As love between them like the palm might flourish,
    As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
    And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
    And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
    That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
    Without debatement further, more or less,
    He should the bearers put to sudden death,
    Not shriving-time allow'd.

HORATIO

    How was this seal'd?

HAMLET

    Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
    I had my father's signet in my purse,
    Which was the model of that Danish seal;
    Folded the writ up in form of the other,
    Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
    The changeling never known. Now, the next day
    Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
    Thou know'st already.

HORATIO

    So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.

HAMLET

    Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
    They are not near my conscience; their defeat
    Does by their own insinuation grow:
    'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
    Between the pass and fell incensed points
    Of mighty opposites.

HORATIO

    Why, what a king is this!

HAMLET

    Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
    He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
    Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
    Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
    And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
    To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
    To let this canker of our nature come
    In further evil?

HORATIO

    It must be shortly known to him from England
    What is the issue of the business there.

HAMLET

    It will be short: the interim is mine;
    And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
    But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
    That to Laertes I forgot myself;
    For, by the image of my cause, I see
    The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
    But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
    Into a towering passion.

HORATIO

    Peace! who comes here?

    Enter OSRIC

OSRIC

    Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.

HAMLET

    I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?

HORATIO

    No, my good lord.

HAMLET

    Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
    know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
    beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
    the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
    spacious in the possession of dirt.

OSRIC

    Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
    should impart a thing to you from his majesty.

HAMLET

    I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
    spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.

OSRIC

    I thank your lordship, it is very hot.

HAMLET

    No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
    northerly.

OSRIC

    It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.

HAMLET

    But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
    complexion.

OSRIC

    Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
    'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
    majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
    great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--

HAMLET

    I beseech you, remember--

    HAMLET moves him to put on his hat

OSRIC

    Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
    Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
    me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
    differences, of very soft society and great showing:
    indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
    calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
    continent of what part a gentleman would see.

HAMLET

    Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
    though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
    dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
    neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
    verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
    great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
    rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
    semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
    him, his umbrage, nothing more.

OSRIC

    Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.

HAMLET

    The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
    in our more rawer breath?

OSRIC

    Sir?

HORATIO

    Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
    You will do't, sir, really.

HAMLET

    What imports the nomination of this gentleman?

OSRIC

    Of Laertes?

HORATIO

    His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.

HAMLET

    Of him, sir.

OSRIC

    I know you are not ignorant--

HAMLET

    I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
    it would not much approve me. Well, sir?

OSRIC

    You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--

HAMLET

    I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
    him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
    know himself.

OSRIC

    I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
    laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.

HAMLET

    What's his weapon?

OSRIC

    Rapier and dagger.

HAMLET

    That's two of his weapons: but, well.

OSRIC

    The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
    horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
    it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
    assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
    carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
    responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
    and of very liberal conceit.

HAMLET

    What call you the carriages?

HORATIO

    I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.

OSRIC

    The carriages, sir, are the hangers.

HAMLET

    The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
    could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
    be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
    against six French swords, their assigns, and three
    liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
    against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?

OSRIC

    The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
    between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
    three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
    would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
    would vouchsafe the answer.

HAMLET

    How if I answer 'no'?

OSRIC

    I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.

HAMLET

    Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
    majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
    the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
    king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
    if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.

OSRIC

    Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?

HAMLET

    To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.

OSRIC

    I commend my duty to your lordship.

HAMLET

    Yours, yours.

    Exit OSRIC
    He does well to commend it himself; there are no
    tongues else for's turn.

HORATIO

    This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.

HAMLET

    He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
    Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
    know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
    the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
    yesty collection, which carries them through and
    through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
    but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.

    Enter a Lord

Lord

    My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
    Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
    the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
    play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.

HAMLET

    I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
    pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
    or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.

Lord

    The king and queen and all are coming down.

HAMLET

    In happy time.

Lord

    The queen desires you to use some gentle
    entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.

HAMLET

    She well instructs me.

    Exit Lord

HORATIO

    You will lose this wager, my lord.

HAMLET

    I do not think so: since he went into France, I
    have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
    odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
    about my heart: but it is no matter.

HORATIO

    Nay, good my lord,--

HAMLET

    It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
    gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.

HORATIO

    If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
    forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
    fit.

HAMLET

    Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
    providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
    'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
    now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
    readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
    leaves, what is't to leave betimes?

    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, & c

KING CLAUDIUS

    Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.

    KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's

HAMLET

    Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
    But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
    This presence knows,
    And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
    With sore distraction. What I have done,
    That might your nature, honour and exception
    Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
    Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
    If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
    And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
    Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
    Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
    Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
    His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
    Sir, in this audience,
    Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
    Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
    That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
    And hurt my brother.

LAERTES

    I am satisfied in nature,
    Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
    To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
    I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
    Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
    I have a voice and precedent of peace,
    To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
    I do receive your offer'd love like love,
    And will not wrong it.

HAMLET

    I embrace it freely;
    And will this brother's wager frankly play.
    Give us the foils. Come on.

LAERTES

    Come, one for me.

HAMLET

    I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
    Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
    Stick fiery off indeed.

LAERTES

    You mock me, sir.

HAMLET

    No, by this hand.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
    You know the wager?

HAMLET

    Very well, my lord
    Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.

KING CLAUDIUS

    I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
    But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.

LAERTES

    This is too heavy, let me see another.

HAMLET

    This likes me well. These foils have all a length?

    They prepare to play

OSRIC

    Ay, my good lord.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
    If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
    Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
    Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
    The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
    And in the cup an union shall he throw,
    Richer than that which four successive kings
    In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
    And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
    The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
    The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
    'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
    And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.

HAMLET

    Come on, sir.

LAERTES

    Come, my lord.

    They play

HAMLET

    One.

LAERTES

    No.

HAMLET

    Judgment.

OSRIC

    A hit, a very palpable hit.

LAERTES

    Well; again.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
    Here's to thy health.

    Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within
    Give him the cup.

HAMLET

    I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.

    They play
    Another hit; what say you?

LAERTES

    A touch, a touch, I do confess.

KING CLAUDIUS

    Our son shall win.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    He's fat, and scant of breath.
    Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
    The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.

HAMLET

    Good madam!

KING CLAUDIUS

    Gertrude, do not drink.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.

KING CLAUDIUS

    [Aside] It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.

HAMLET

    I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    Come, let me wipe thy face.

LAERTES

    My lord, I'll hit him now.

KING CLAUDIUS

    I do not think't.

LAERTES

    [Aside] And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.

HAMLET

    Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
    I pray you, pass with your best violence;
    I am afeard you make a wanton of me.

LAERTES

    Say you so? come on.

    They play

OSRIC

    Nothing, neither way.

LAERTES

    Have at you now!

    LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES

KING CLAUDIUS

    Part them; they are incensed.

HAMLET

    Nay, come, again.

    QUEEN GERTRUDE falls

OSRIC

    Look to the queen there, ho!

HORATIO

    They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?

OSRIC

    How is't, Laertes?

LAERTES

    Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
    I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.

HAMLET

    How does the queen?

KING CLAUDIUS

    She swounds to see them bleed.

QUEEN GERTRUDE

    No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
    The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.

    Dies

HAMLET

    O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
    Treachery! Seek it out.

LAERTES

    It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
    No medicine in the world can do thee good;
    In thee there is not half an hour of life;
    The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
    Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
    Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
    Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
    I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.

HAMLET

    The point!--envenom'd too!
    Then, venom, to thy work.

    Stabs KING CLAUDIUS

All

    Treason! treason!

KING CLAUDIUS

    O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.

HAMLET

    Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
    Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
    Follow my mother.

    KING CLAUDIUS dies

LAERTES

    He is justly served;
    It is a poison temper'd by himself.
    Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
    Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
    Nor thine on me.

    Dies

HAMLET

    Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
    I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
    You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
    That are but mutes or audience to this act,
    Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
    Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
    But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
    Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
    To the unsatisfied.

HORATIO

    Never believe it:
    I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
    Here's yet some liquor left.

HAMLET

    As thou'rt a man,
    Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
    O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
    Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
    If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
    Absent thee from felicity awhile,
    And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
    To tell my story.

    March afar off, and shot within
    What warlike noise is this?

OSRIC

    Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
    To the ambassadors of England gives
    This warlike volley.

HAMLET

    O, I die, Horatio;
    The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
    I cannot live to hear the news from England;
    But I do prophesy the election lights
    On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
    So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
    Which have solicited. The rest is silence.

    Dies

HORATIO

    Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
    And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
    Why does the drum come hither?

    March within

    Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors, and others

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Where is this sight?

HORATIO

    What is it ye would see?
    If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
    What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
    That thou so many princes at a shot
    So bloodily hast struck?

First Ambassador

    The sight is dismal;
    And our affairs from England come too late:
    The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
    To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
    That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
    Where should we have our thanks?

HORATIO

    Not from his mouth,
    Had it the ability of life to thank you:
    He never gave commandment for their death.
    But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
    You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
    Are here arrived give order that these bodies
    High on a stage be placed to the view;
    And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
    How these things came about: so shall you hear
    Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
    Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
    Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
    And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
    Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
    Truly deliver.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Let us haste to hear it,
    And call the noblest to the audience.
    For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
    I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
    Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.

HORATIO

    Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
    And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
    But let this same be presently perform'd,
    Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
    On plots and errors, happen.

PRINCE FORTINBRAS

    Let four captains
    Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
    For he was likely, had he been put on,
    To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
    The soldiers' music and the rites of war
    Speak loudly for him.
    Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
    Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
    Go, bid the soldiers shoot.

    A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off


The Life and Death of Julius Caesar

ACT I
SCENE I. Rome. A street.

    Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners

FLAVIUS

    Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:
    Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
    Being mechanical, you ought not walk
    Upon a labouring day without the sign
    Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?

First Commoner

    Why, sir, a carpenter.

MARULLUS

    Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
    What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
    You, sir, what trade are you?

Second Commoner

    Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
    as you would say, a cobbler.

MARULLUS

    But what trade art thou? answer me directly.

Second Commoner

    A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
    conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.

MARULLUS

    What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?

Second Commoner

    Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
    if you be out, sir, I can mend you.

MARULLUS

    What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!

Second Commoner

    Why, sir, cobble you.

FLAVIUS

    Thou art a cobbler, art thou?

Second Commoner

    Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
    meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
    matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
    to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
    recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
    neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.

FLAVIUS

    But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
    Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?

Second Commoner

    Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
    into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
    to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.

MARULLUS

    Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
    What tributaries follow him to Rome,
    To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
    You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
    O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
    Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
    Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
    To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
    Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
    The livelong day, with patient expectation,
    To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
    And when you saw his chariot but appear,
    Have you not made an universal shout,
    That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
    To hear the replication of your sounds
    Made in her concave shores?
    And do you now put on your best attire?
    And do you now cull out a holiday?
    And do you now strew flowers in his way
    That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
    Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
    Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
    That needs must light on this ingratitude.

FLAVIUS

    Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
    Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
    Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
    Into the channel, till the lowest stream
    Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.

    Exeunt all the Commoners
    See whether their basest metal be not moved;
    They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
    Go you down that way towards the Capitol;

This way will I

    disrobe the images,
    If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.

MARULLUS

    May we do so?
    You know it is the feast of Lupercal.

FLAVIUS

    It is no matter; let no images
    Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
    And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
    So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
    These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
    Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
    Who else would soar above the view of men
    And keep us all in servile fearfulness.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A public place.

    Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course; CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer

CAESAR

    Calpurnia!

CASCA

    Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.

CAESAR

    Calpurnia!

CALPURNIA

    Here, my lord.

CAESAR

    Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
    When he doth run his course. Antonius!

ANTONY

    Caesar, my lord?

CAESAR

    Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
    To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
    The barren, touched in this holy chase,
    Shake off their sterile curse.

ANTONY

    I shall remember:
    When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.

CAESAR

    Set on; and leave no ceremony out.

    Flourish

Soothsayer

    Caesar!

CAESAR

    Ha! who calls?

CASCA

    Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!

CAESAR

    Who is it in the press that calls on me?
    I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
    Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.

Soothsayer

    Beware the ides of March.

CAESAR

    What man is that?

BRUTUS

    A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.

CAESAR

    Set him before me; let me see his face.

CASSIUS

    Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.

CAESAR

    What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.

Soothsayer

    Beware the ides of March.

CAESAR

    He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.

    Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS

CASSIUS

    Will you go see the order of the course?

BRUTUS

    Not I.

CASSIUS

    I pray you, do.

BRUTUS

    I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
    Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
    Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
    I'll leave you.

CASSIUS

    Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
    I have not from your eyes that gentleness
    And show of love as I was wont to have:
    You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
    Over your friend that loves you.

BRUTUS

    Cassius,
    Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
    I turn the trouble of my countenance
    Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
    Of late with passions of some difference,
    Conceptions only proper to myself,
    Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
    But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
    Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
    Nor construe any further my neglect,
    Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
    Forgets the shows of love to other men.

CASSIUS

    Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
    By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
    Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
    Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?

BRUTUS

    No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
    But by reflection, by some other things.

CASSIUS

    'Tis just:
    And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
    That you have no such mirrors as will turn
    Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
    That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
    Where many of the best respect in Rome,
    Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
    And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
    Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.

BRUTUS

    Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
    That you would have me seek into myself
    For that which is not in me?

CASSIUS

    Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
    And since you know you cannot see yourself
    So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
    Will modestly discover to yourself
    That of yourself which you yet know not of.
    And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
    Were I a common laugher, or did use
    To stale with ordinary oaths my love
    To every new protester; if you know
    That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
    And after scandal them, or if you know
    That I profess myself in banqueting
    To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.

    Flourish, and shout

BRUTUS

    What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
    Choose Caesar for their king.

CASSIUS

    Ay, do you fear it?
    Then must I think you would not have it so.

BRUTUS

    I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
    But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
    What is it that you would impart to me?
    If it be aught toward the general good,
    Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
    And I will look on both indifferently,
    For let the gods so speed me as I love
    The name of honour more than I fear death.

CASSIUS

    I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
    As well as I do know your outward favour.
    Well, honour is the subject of my story.
    I cannot tell what you and other men
    Think of this life; but, for my single self,
    I had as lief not be as live to be
    In awe of such a thing as I myself.
    I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
    We both have fed as well, and we can both
    Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
    For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
    The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
    Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
    Leap in with me into this angry flood,
    And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
    Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
    And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
    The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
    With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
    And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
    But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
    Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
    I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
    Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
    The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
    Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
    Is now become a god, and Cassius is
    A wretched creature and must bend his body,
    If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
    He had a fever when he was in Spain,
    And when the fit was on him, I did mark
    How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
    His coward lips did from their colour fly,
    And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
    Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
    Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
    Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
    Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
    As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
    A man of such a feeble temper should
    So get the start of the majestic world
    And bear the palm alone.

    Shout. Flourish

BRUTUS

    Another general shout!
    I do believe that these applauses are
    For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.

CASSIUS

    Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
    Like a Colossus, and we petty men
    Walk under his huge legs and peep about
    To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
    Men at some time are masters of their fates:
    The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
    But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
    Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
    Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
    Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
    Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
    Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
    Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
    Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
    Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
    That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
    Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
    When went there by an age, since the great flood,
    But it was famed with more than with one man?
    When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
    That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
    Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
    When there is in it but one only man.
    O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
    There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
    The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
    As easily as a king.

BRUTUS

    That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
    What you would work me to, I have some aim:
    How I have thought of this and of these times,
    I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
    I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
    Be any further moved. What you have said
    I will consider; what you have to say
    I will with patience hear, and find a time
    Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
    Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
    Brutus had rather be a villager
    Than to repute himself a son of Rome
    Under these hard conditions as this time
    Is like to lay upon us.

CASSIUS

    I am glad that my weak words
    Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.

BRUTUS

    The games are done and Caesar is returning.

CASSIUS

    As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
    And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
    What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.

    Re-enter CAESAR and his Train

BRUTUS

    I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
    The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
    And all the rest look like a chidden train:
    Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
    Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
    As we have seen him in the Capitol,
    Being cross'd in conference by some senators.

CASSIUS

    Casca will tell us what the matter is.

CAESAR

    Antonius!

ANTONY

    Caesar?

CAESAR

    Let me have men about me that are fat;
    Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
    Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
    He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.

ANTONY

    Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
    He is a noble Roman and well given.

CAESAR

    Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
    Yet if my name were liable to fear,
    I do not know the man I should avoid
    So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
    He is a great observer and he looks
    Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
    As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
    Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
    As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
    That could be moved to smile at any thing.
    Such men as he be never at heart's ease
    Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
    And therefore are they very dangerous.
    I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
    Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
    Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
    And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.

    Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA

CASCA

    You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?

BRUTUS

    Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
    That Caesar looks so sad.

CASCA

    Why, you were with him, were you not?

BRUTUS

    I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.

CASCA

    Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
    offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
    thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.

BRUTUS

    What was the second noise for?

CASCA

    Why, for that too.

CASSIUS

    They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?

CASCA

    Why, for that too.

BRUTUS

    Was the crown offered him thrice?

CASCA

    Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
    time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
    mine honest neighbours shouted.

CASSIUS

    Who offered him the crown?

CASCA

    Why, Antony.

BRUTUS

    Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.

CASCA

    I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
    it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
    Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
    neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
    you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
    thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
    offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
    but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
    fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
    time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
    refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
    chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
    and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
    Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
    Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
    for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
    opening my lips and receiving the bad air.

CASSIUS

    But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?

CASCA

    He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
    mouth, and was speechless.

BRUTUS

    'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.

CASSIUS

    No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
    And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.

CASCA

    I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
    Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
    clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
    displeased them, as they use to do the players in
    the theatre, I am no true man.

BRUTUS

    What said he when he came unto himself?

CASCA

    Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
    common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
    plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
    throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
    occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
    I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
    he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
    If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
    their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
    or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
    soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
    there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
    stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.

BRUTUS

    And after that, he came, thus sad, away?

CASCA

    Ay.

CASSIUS

    Did Cicero say any thing?

CASCA

    Ay, he spoke Greek.

CASSIUS

    To what effect?

CASCA

    Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
    face again: but those that understood him smiled at
    one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
    part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
    news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
    off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
    well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
    remember it.

CASSIUS

    Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?

CASCA

    No, I am promised forth.

CASSIUS

    Will you dine with me to-morrow?

CASCA

    Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
    worth the eating.

CASSIUS

    Good: I will expect you.

CASCA

    Do so. Farewell, both.

    Exit

BRUTUS

    What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
    He was quick mettle when he went to school.

CASSIUS

    So is he now in execution
    Of any bold or noble enterprise,
    However he puts on this tardy form.
    This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
    Which gives men stomach to digest his words
    With better appetite.

BRUTUS

    And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
    To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
    I will come home to you; or, if you will,
    Come home to me, and I will wait for you.

CASSIUS

    I will do so: till then, think of the world.

    Exit BRUTUS
    Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
    Thy honourable metal may be wrought
    From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
    That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
    For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
    Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
    If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
    He should not humour me. I will this night,
    In several hands, in at his windows throw,
    As if they came from several citizens,
    Writings all tending to the great opinion
    That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
    Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
    And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
    For we will shake him, or worse days endure.

    Exit

SCENE III. The same. A street.

    Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides, CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO

CICERO

    Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
    Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?

CASCA

    Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
    Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
    I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
    Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
    The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
    To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
    But never till to-night, never till now,
    Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
    Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
    Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
    Incenses them to send destruction.

CICERO

    Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?

CASCA

    A common slave--you know him well by sight--
    Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
    Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
    Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
    Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
    Against the Capitol I met a lion,
    Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
    Without annoying me: and there were drawn
    Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
    Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
    Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
    And yesterday the bird of night did sit
    Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
    Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
    Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
    'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
    For, I believe, they are portentous things
    Unto the climate that they point upon.

CICERO

    Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
    But men may construe things after their fashion,
    Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
    Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?

CASCA

    He doth; for he did bid Antonius
    Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.

CICERO

    Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
    Is not to walk in.

CASCA

    Farewell, Cicero.

    Exit CICERO

    Enter CASSIUS

CASSIUS

    Who's there?

CASCA

    A Roman.

CASSIUS

    Casca, by your voice.

CASCA

    Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!

CASSIUS

    A very pleasing night to honest men.

CASCA

    Who ever knew the heavens menace so?

CASSIUS

    Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
    For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
    Submitting me unto the perilous night,
    And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
    Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
    And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
    The breast of heaven, I did present myself
    Even in the aim and very flash of it.

CASCA

    But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
    It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
    When the most mighty gods by tokens send
    Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.

CASSIUS

    You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
    That should be in a Roman you do want,
    Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
    And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
    To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
    But if you would consider the true cause
    Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
    Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
    Why old men fool and children calculate,
    Why all these things change from their ordinance
    Their natures and preformed faculties
    To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
    That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
    To make them instruments of fear and warning
    Unto some monstrous state.
    Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
    Most like this dreadful night,
    That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
    As doth the lion in the Capitol,
    A man no mightier than thyself or me
    In personal action, yet prodigious grown
    And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.

CASCA

    'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?

CASSIUS

    Let it be who it is: for Romans now
    Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
    But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
    And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
    Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.

CASCA

    Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
    Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
    And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
    In every place, save here in Italy.

CASSIUS

    I know where I will wear this dagger then;
    Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
    Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
    Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
    Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
    Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
    Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
    But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
    Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
    If I know this, know all the world besides,
    That part of tyranny that I do bear
    I can shake off at pleasure.

    Thunder still

CASCA

    So can I:
    So every bondman in his own hand bears
    The power to cancel his captivity.

CASSIUS

    And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
    Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
    But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
    He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
    Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
    Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
    What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
    For the base matter to illuminate
    So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
    Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
    Before a willing bondman; then I know
    My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
    And dangers are to me indifferent.

CASCA

    You speak to Casca, and to such a man
    That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
    Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
    And I will set this foot of mine as far
    As who goes farthest.

CASSIUS

    There's a bargain made.
    Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
    Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
    To undergo with me an enterprise
    Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
    And I do know, by this, they stay for me
    In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
    There is no stir or walking in the streets;
    And the complexion of the element
    In favour's like the work we have in hand,
    Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.

CASCA

    Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.

CASSIUS

    'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
    He is a friend.

    Enter CINNA
    Cinna, where haste you so?

CINNA

    To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?

CASSIUS

    No, it is Casca; one incorporate
    To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?

CINNA

    I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
    There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.

CASSIUS

    Am I not stay'd for? tell me.

CINNA

    Yes, you are.
    O Cassius, if you could
    But win the noble Brutus to our party--

CASSIUS

    Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
    And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
    Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
    In at his window; set this up with wax
    Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
    Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
    Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?

CINNA

    All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
    To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
    And so bestow these papers as you bade me.

CASSIUS

    That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.

    Exit CINNA
    Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
    See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
    Is ours already, and the man entire
    Upon the next encounter yields him ours.

CASCA

    O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
    And that which would appear offence in us,
    His countenance, like richest alchemy,
    Will change to virtue and to worthiness.

CASSIUS

    Him and his worth and our great need of him
    You have right well conceited. Let us go,
    For it is after midnight; and ere day
    We will awake him and be sure of him.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.

    Enter BRUTUS

BRUTUS

    What, Lucius, ho!
    I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
    Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
    I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
    When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!

    Enter LUCIUS

LUCIUS

    Call'd you, my lord?

BRUTUS

    Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
    When it is lighted, come and call me here.

LUCIUS

    I will, my lord.

    Exit

BRUTUS

    It must be by his death: and for my part,
    I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
    But for the general. He would be crown'd:
    How that might change his nature, there's the question.
    It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
    And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
    And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
    That at his will he may do danger with.
    The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
    Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
    I have not known when his affections sway'd
    More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
    That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
    Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
    But when he once attains the upmost round.
    He then unto the ladder turns his back,
    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
    By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
    Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
    Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
    Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
    Would run to these and these extremities:
    And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
    Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
    And kill him in the shell.

    Re-enter LUCIUS

LUCIUS

    The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
    Searching the window for a flint, I found
    This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
    It did not lie there when I went to bed.

    Gives him the letter

BRUTUS

    Get you to bed again; it is not day.
    Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?

LUCIUS

    I know not, sir.

BRUTUS

    Look in the calendar, and bring me word.

LUCIUS

    I will, sir.

    Exit

BRUTUS

    The exhalations whizzing in the air
    Give so much light that I may read by them.

    Opens the letter and reads
    'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.
    Shall Rome, & c. Speak, strike, redress!
    Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'
    Such instigations have been often dropp'd
    Where I have took them up.
    'Shall Rome, & c.' Thus must I piece it out:
    Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
    My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
    The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
    'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
    To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
    If the redress will follow, thou receivest
    Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!

    Re-enter LUCIUS

LUCIUS

    Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.

    Knocking within

BRUTUS

    'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.

    Exit LUCIUS
    Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
    I have not slept.
    Between the acting of a dreadful thing
    And the first motion, all the interim is
    Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
    The Genius and the mortal instruments
    Are then in council; and the state of man,
    Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
    The nature of an insurrection.

    Re-enter LUCIUS

LUCIUS

    Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
    Who doth desire to see you.

BRUTUS

    Is he alone?

LUCIUS

    No, sir, there are moe with him.

BRUTUS

    Do you know them?

LUCIUS

    No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
    And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
    That by no means I may discover them
    By any mark of favour.

BRUTUS

    Let 'em enter.

    Exit LUCIUS
    They are the faction. O conspiracy,
    Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
    When evils are most free? O, then by day
    Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
    To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
    Hide it in smiles and affability:
    For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
    Not Erebus itself were dim enough
    To hide thee from prevention.

    Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS

CASSIUS

    I think we are too bold upon your rest:
    Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?

BRUTUS

    I have been up this hour, awake all night.
    Know I these men that come along with you?

CASSIUS

    Yes, every man of them, and no man here
    But honours you; and every one doth wish
    You had but that opinion of yourself
    Which every noble Roman bears of you.
    This is Trebonius.

BRUTUS

    He is welcome hither.

CASSIUS

    This, Decius Brutus.

BRUTUS

    He is welcome too.

CASSIUS

    This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.

BRUTUS

    They are all welcome.
    What watchful cares do interpose themselves
    Betwixt your eyes and night?

CASSIUS

    Shall I entreat a word?

    BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper

DECIUS BRUTUS

    Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?

CASCA

    No.

CINNA

    O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
    That fret the clouds are messengers of day.

CASCA

    You shall confess that you are both deceived.
    Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
    Which is a great way growing on the south,
    Weighing the youthful season of the year.
    Some two months hence up higher toward the north
    He first presents his fire; and the high east
    Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.

BRUTUS

    Give me your hands all over, one by one.

CASSIUS

    And let us swear our resolution.

BRUTUS

    No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
    The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
    If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
    And every man hence to his idle bed;
    So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
    Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
    As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
    To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
    The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
    What need we any spur but our own cause,
    To prick us to redress? what other bond
    Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
    And will not palter? and what other oath
    Than honesty to honesty engaged,
    That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
    Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
    Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
    That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
    Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
    The even virtue of our enterprise,
    Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
    To think that or our cause or our performance
    Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
    That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
    Is guilty of a several bastardy,
    If he do break the smallest particle
    Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.

CASSIUS

    But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
    I think he will stand very strong with us.

CASCA

    Let us not leave him out.

CINNA

    No, by no means.

METELLUS CIMBER

    O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
    Will purchase us a good opinion
    And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
    It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
    Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
    But all be buried in his gravity.

BRUTUS

    O, name him not: let us not break with him;
    For he will never follow any thing
    That other men begin.

CASSIUS

    Then leave him out.

CASCA

    Indeed he is not fit.

DECIUS BRUTUS

    Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?

CASSIUS

    Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
    Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
    Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
    A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
    If he improve them, may well stretch so far
    As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
    Let Antony and Caesar fall together.

BRUTUS

    Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
    To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
    Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
    For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
    Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
    We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
    And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
    O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
    And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
    Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
    Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
    Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
    Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
    And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
    Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
    And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
    Our purpose necessary and not envious:
    Which so appearing to the common eyes,
    We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
    And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
    For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
    When Caesar's head is off.

CASSIUS

    Yet I fear him;
    For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--

BRUTUS

    Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
    If he love Caesar, all that he can do
    Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
    And that were much he should; for he is given
    To sports, to wildness and much company.

TREBONIUS

    There is no fear in him; let him not die;
    For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.

    Clock strikes

BRUTUS

    Peace! count the clock.

CASSIUS

    The clock hath stricken three.

TREBONIUS

    'Tis time to part.

CASSIUS

    But it is doubtful yet,
    Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
    For he is superstitious grown of late,
    Quite from the main opinion he held once
    Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
    It may be, these apparent prodigies,
    The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
    And the persuasion of his augurers,
    May hold him from the Capitol to-day.

DECIUS BRUTUS

    Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
    I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
    That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
    And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
    Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
    But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
    He says he does, being then most flattered.
    Let me work;
    For I can give his humour the true bent,
    And I will bring him to the Capitol.

CASSIUS

    Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.

BRUTUS

    By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?

CINNA

    Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.

METELLUS CIMBER

    Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
    Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
    I wonder none of you have thought of him.

BRUTUS

    Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
    He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
    Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.

CASSIUS

    The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
    And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
    What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.

BRUTUS

    Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
    Let not our looks put on our purposes,
    But bear it as our Roman actors do,
    With untired spirits and formal constancy:
    And so good morrow to you every one.

    Exeunt all but BRUTUS
    Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
    Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
    Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
    Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
    Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.

    Enter PORTIA

PORTIA

    Brutus, my lord!

BRUTUS

    Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
    It is not for your health thus to commit
    Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.

PORTIA

    Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
    Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
    You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
    Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
    And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
    You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
    I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
    And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
    Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
    But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
    Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
    Fearing to strengthen that impatience
    Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
    Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
    Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
    It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
    And could it work so much upon your shape
    As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
    I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
    Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.

BRUTUS

    I am not well in health, and that is all.

PORTIA

    Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
    He would embrace the means to come by it.

BRUTUS

    Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.

PORTIA

    Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
    To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
    Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
    And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
    To dare the vile contagion of the night
    And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
    To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
    You have some sick offence within your mind,
    Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
    I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
    I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
    By all your vows of love and that great vow
    Which did incorporate and make us one,
    That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
    Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
    Have had to resort to you: for here have been
    Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
    Even from darkness.

BRUTUS

    Kneel not, gentle Portia.

PORTIA

    I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
    Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
    Is it excepted I should know no secrets
    That appertain to you? Am I yourself
    But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
    To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
    And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
    Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
    Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.

BRUTUS

    You are my true and honourable wife,
    As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
    That visit my sad heart

PORTIA

    If this were true, then should I know this secret.
    I grant I am a woman; but withal
    A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
    I grant I am a woman; but withal
    A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
    Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
    Being so father'd and so husbanded?
    Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
    I have made strong proof of my constancy,
    Giving myself a voluntary wound
    Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
    And not my husband's secrets?

BRUTUS

    O ye gods,
    Render me worthy of this noble wife!

    Knocking within
    Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
    And by and by thy bosom shall partake
    The secrets of my heart.
    All my engagements I will construe to thee,
    All the charactery of my sad brows:
    Leave me with haste.

    Exit PORTIA
    Lucius, who's that knocks?

    Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS

LUCIUS

    He is a sick man that would speak with you.

BRUTUS

    Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
    Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?

LIGARIUS

    Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.

BRUTUS

    O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
    To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!

LIGARIUS

    I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
    Any exploit worthy the name of honour.

BRUTUS

    Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
    Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.

LIGARIUS

    By all the gods that Romans bow before,
    I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
    Brave son, derived from honourable loins!
    Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
    My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
    And I will strive with things impossible;
    Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?

BRUTUS

    A piece of work that will make sick men whole.

LIGARIUS

    But are not some whole that we must make sick?

BRUTUS

    That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
    I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
    To whom it must be done.

LIGARIUS

    Set on your foot,
    And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
    To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
    That Brutus leads me on.

BRUTUS

    Follow me, then.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. CAESAR's house.

    Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his night-gown

CAESAR

    Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
    Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
    'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?

    Enter a Servant

Servant

    My lord?

CAESAR

    Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
    And bring me their opinions of success.

Servant

    I will, my lord.

    Exit

    Enter CALPURNIA

CALPURNIA

    What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?
    You shall not stir out of your house to-day.

CAESAR

    Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
    Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
    The face of Caesar, they are vanished.

CALPURNIA

    Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
    Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
    Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
    Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
    A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
    And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
    Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
    In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
    Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
    The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
    Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
    And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
    O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
    And I do fear them.

CAESAR

    What can be avoided
    Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
    Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
    Are to the world in general as to Caesar.

CALPURNIA

    When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
    The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.

CAESAR

    Cowards die many times before their deaths;
    The valiant never taste of death but once.
    Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
    It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
    Seeing that death, a necessary end,
    Will come when it will come.

    Re-enter Servant
    What say the augurers?

Servant

    They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
    Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
    They could not find a heart within the beast.

CAESAR

    The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
    Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
    If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
    No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
    That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
    We are two lions litter'd in one day,
    And I the elder and more terrible:
    And Caesar shall go forth.

CALPURNIA

    Alas, my lord,
    Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
    Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
    That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
    We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
    And he shall say you are not well to-day:
    Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.

CAESAR

    Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
    And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.

    Enter DECIUS BRUTUS
    Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.

DECIUS BRUTUS

    Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:
    I come to fetch you to the senate-house.

CAESAR

    And you are come in very happy time,
    To bear my greeting to the senators
    And tell them that I will not come to-day:
    Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
    I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.

CALPURNIA

    Say he is sick.

CAESAR

    Shall Caesar send a lie?
    Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
    To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
    Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.

DECIUS BRUTUS

    Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
    Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.

CAESAR

    The cause is in my will: I will not come;
    That is enough to satisfy the senate.
    But for your private satisfaction,
    Because I love you, I will let you know:
    Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
    She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
    Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
    Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
    Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
    And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
    And evils imminent; and on her knee
    Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.

DECIUS BRUTUS

    This dream is all amiss interpreted;
    It was a vision fair and fortunate:
    Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
    In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
    Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
    Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
    For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
    This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.

CAESAR

    And this way have you well expounded it.

DECIUS BRUTUS

    I have, when you have heard what I can say:
    And know it now: the senate have concluded
    To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
    If you shall send them word you will not come,
    Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
    Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
    'Break up the senate till another time,
    When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
    If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
    'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
    Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
    To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
    And reason to my love is liable.

CAESAR

    How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
    I am ashamed I did yield to them.
    Give me my robe, for I will go.

    Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA, TREBONIUS, and CINNA
    And look where Publius is come to fetch me.

PUBLIUS

    Good morrow, Caesar.

CAESAR

    Welcome, Publius.
    What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
    Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
    Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
    As that same ague which hath made you lean.
    What is 't o'clock?

BRUTUS

    Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.

CAESAR

    I thank you for your pains and courtesy.

    Enter ANTONY
    See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
    Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.

ANTONY

    So to most noble Caesar.

CAESAR

    Bid them prepare within:
    I am to blame to be thus waited for.
    Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!
    I have an hour's talk in store for you;
    Remember that you call on me to-day:
    Be near me, that I may remember you.

TREBONIUS

    Caesar, I will:

    Aside
    and so near will I be,
    That your best friends shall wish I had been further.

CAESAR

    Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
    And we, like friends, will straightway go together.

BRUTUS

    [Aside] That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
    The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A street near the Capitol.

    Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paper

ARTEMIDORUS

    'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;
    come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not
    Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus
    loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
    There is but one mind in all these men, and it is
    bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,
    look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.
    The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,
    'ARTEMIDORUS.'
    Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
    And as a suitor will I give him this.
    My heart laments that virtue cannot live
    Out of the teeth of emulation.
    If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;
    If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.

    Exit

SCENE IV. Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS.

    Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS

PORTIA

    I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;
    Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:
    Why dost thou stay?

LUCIUS

    To know my errand, madam.

PORTIA

    I would have had thee there, and here again,
    Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
    O constancy, be strong upon my side,
    Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
    I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
    How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
    Art thou here yet?

LUCIUS

    Madam, what should I do?
    Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
    And so return to you, and nothing else?

PORTIA

    Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
    For he went sickly forth: and take good note
    What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
    Hark, boy! what noise is that?

LUCIUS

    I hear none, madam.

PORTIA

    Prithee, listen well;
    I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
    And the wind brings it from the Capitol.

LUCIUS

    Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.

    Enter the Soothsayer

PORTIA

    Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?

Soothsayer

    At mine own house, good lady.

PORTIA

    What is't o'clock?

Soothsayer

    About the ninth hour, lady.

PORTIA

    Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?

Soothsayer

    Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
    To see him pass on to the Capitol.

PORTIA

    Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?

Soothsayer

    That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar
    To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
    I shall beseech him to befriend himself.

PORTIA

    Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?

Soothsayer

    None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
    Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
    The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
    Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
    Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
    I'll get me to a place more void, and there
    Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.

    Exit

PORTIA

    I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
    The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
    The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
    Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
    That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
    Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
    Say I am merry: come to me again,
    And bring me word what he doth say to thee.

    Exeunt severally

ACT III
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.

    A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR, BRUTUS, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, METELLUS CIMBER, TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS, PUBLIUS, and others

CAESAR

    [To the Soothsayer] The ides of March are come.

Soothsayer

    Ay, Caesar; but not gone.

ARTEMIDORUS

    Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.

DECIUS BRUTUS

    Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,
    At your best leisure, this his humble suit.

ARTEMIDORUS

    O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit
    That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.

CAESAR

    What touches us ourself shall be last served.

ARTEMIDORUS

    Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.

CAESAR

    What, is the fellow mad?

PUBLIUS

    Sirrah, give place.

CASSIUS

    What, urge you your petitions in the street?
    Come to the Capitol.

    CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest following

POPILIUS

    I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.

CASSIUS

    What enterprise, Popilius?

POPILIUS

    Fare you well.

    Advances to CAESAR

BRUTUS

    What said Popilius Lena?

CASSIUS

    He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
    I fear our purpose is discovered.

BRUTUS

    Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.

CASSIUS

    Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
    Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
    Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
    For I will slay myself.

BRUTUS

    Cassius, be constant:
    Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
    For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.

CASSIUS

    Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.
    He draws Mark Antony out of the way.

    Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS

DECIUS BRUTUS

    Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
    And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.

BRUTUS

    He is address'd: press near and second him.

CINNA

    Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.

CAESAR

    Are we all ready? What is now amiss
    That Caesar and his senate must redress?

METELLUS CIMBER

    Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
    Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
    An humble heart,--

    Kneeling

CAESAR

    I must prevent thee, Cimber.
    These couchings and these lowly courtesies
    Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
    And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
    Into the law of children. Be not fond,
    To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
    That will be thaw'd from the true quality
    With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
    Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.
    Thy brother by decree is banished:
    If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
    I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
    Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
    Will he be satisfied.

METELLUS CIMBER

    Is there no voice more worthy than my own
    To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
    For the repealing of my banish'd brother?

BRUTUS

    I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
    Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
    Have an immediate freedom of repeal.

CAESAR

    What, Brutus!

CASSIUS

    Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:
    As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
    To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.

CASSIUS

    I could be well moved, if I were as you:
    If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
    But I am constant as the northern star,
    Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
    There is no fellow in the firmament.
    The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
    They are all fire and every one doth shine,
    But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
    So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
    And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
    Yet in the number I do know but one
    That unassailable holds on his rank,
    Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
    Let me a little show it, even in this;
    That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
    And constant do remain to keep him so.

CINNA

    O Caesar,--

CAESAR

    Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?

DECIUS BRUTUS

    Great Caesar,--

CAESAR

    Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?

CASCA

    Speak, hands for me!

    CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and BRUTUS stab CAESAR

CAESAR

    Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.

    Dies

CINNA

    Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
    Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.

CASSIUS

    Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
    'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'

BRUTUS

    People and senators, be not affrighted;
    Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.

CASCA

    Go to the pulpit, Brutus.

DECIUS BRUTUS

    And Cassius too.

BRUTUS

    Where's Publius?

CINNA

    Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.

METELLUS CIMBER

    Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
    Should chance--

BRUTUS

    Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;
    There is no harm intended to your person,
    Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.

CASSIUS

    And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,
    Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.

BRUTUS

    Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
    But we the doers.

    Re-enter TREBONIUS

CASSIUS

    Where is Antony?

TREBONIUS

    Fled to his house amazed:
    Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
    As it were doomsday.

BRUTUS

    Fates, we will know your pleasures:
    That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
    And drawing days out, that men stand upon.

CASSIUS

    Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
    Cuts off so many years of fearing death.

BRUTUS

    Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
    So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
    His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
    And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
    Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
    Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
    And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
    Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'

CASSIUS

    Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
    Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
    In states unborn and accents yet unknown!

BRUTUS

    How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
    That now on Pompey's basis lies along
    No worthier than the dust!

CASSIUS

    So oft as that shall be,
    So often shall the knot of us be call'd
    The men that gave their country liberty.

DECIUS BRUTUS

    What, shall we forth?

CASSIUS

    Ay, every man away:
    Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
    With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.

    Enter a Servant

BRUTUS

    Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.

Servant

    Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:
    Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
    And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
    Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
    Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:
    Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;
    Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.
    If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
    May safely come to him, and be resolved
    How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
    Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
    So well as Brutus living; but will follow
    The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
    Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
    With all true faith. So says my master Antony.

BRUTUS

    Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
    I never thought him worse.
    Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
    He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,
    Depart untouch'd.

Servant

    I'll fetch him presently.

    Exit

BRUTUS

    I know that we shall have him well to friend.

CASSIUS

    I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
    That fears him much; and my misgiving still
    Falls shrewdly to the purpose.

BRUTUS

    But here comes Antony.

    Re-enter ANTONY
    Welcome, Mark Antony.

ANTONY

    O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
    Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
    Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
    I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
    Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
    If I myself, there is no hour so fit
    As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument
    Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
    With the most noble blood of all this world.
    I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
    Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
    Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
    I shall not find myself so apt to die:
    No place will please me so, no mean of death,
    As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
    The choice and master spirits of this age.

BRUTUS

    O Antony, beg not your death of us.
    Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
    As, by our hands and this our present act,
    You see we do, yet see you but our hands
    And this the bleeding business they have done:
    Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
    And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
    As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
    Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
    To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
    Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
    Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
    With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.

CASSIUS

    Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
    In the disposing of new dignities.

BRUTUS

    Only be patient till we have appeased
    The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
    And then we will deliver you the cause,
    Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
    Have thus proceeded.

ANTONY

    I doubt not of your wisdom.
    Let each man render me his bloody hand:
    First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
    Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
    Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;
    Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
    Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
    Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
    My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
    That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
    Either a coward or a flatterer.
    That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
    If then thy spirit look upon us now,
    Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
    To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
    Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
    Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
    Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
    Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
    It would become me better than to close
    In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
    Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
    Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
    Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
    O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
    And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
    How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
    Dost thou here lie!

CASSIUS

    Mark Antony,--

ANTONY

    Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
    The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
    Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.

CASSIUS

    I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
    But what compact mean you to have with us?
    Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
    Or shall we on, and not depend on you?

ANTONY

    Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
    Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
    Friends am I with you all and love you all,
    Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
    Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.

BRUTUS

    Or else were this a savage spectacle:
    Our reasons are so full of good regard
    That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
    You should be satisfied.

ANTONY

    That's all I seek:
    And am moreover suitor that I may
    Produce his body to the market-place;
    And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
    Speak in the order of his funeral.

BRUTUS

    You shall, Mark Antony.

CASSIUS

    Brutus, a word with you.

    Aside to BRUTUS
    You know not what you do: do not consent
    That Antony speak in his funeral:
    Know you how much the people may be moved
    By that which he will utter?

BRUTUS

    By your pardon;
    I will myself into the pulpit first,
    And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
    What Antony shall speak, I will protest
    He speaks by leave and by permission,
    And that we are contented Caesar shall
    Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
    It shall advantage more than do us wrong.

CASSIUS

    I know not what may fall; I like it not.

BRUTUS

    Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
    You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
    But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
    And say you do't by our permission;
    Else shall you not have any hand at all
    About his funeral: and you shall speak
    In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
    After my speech is ended.

ANTONY

    Be it so.
    I do desire no more.

BRUTUS

    Prepare the body then, and follow us.

    Exeunt all but ANTONY

ANTONY

    O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
    That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
    Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
    That ever lived in the tide of times.
    Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
    Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
    Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
    To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
    A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
    Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
    Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
    Blood and destruction shall be so in use
    And dreadful objects so familiar
    That mothers shall but smile when they behold
    Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
    All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
    And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
    With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
    Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
    Cry 'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
    That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
    With carrion men, groaning for burial.

    Enter a Servant
    You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?

Servant

    I do, Mark Antony.

ANTONY

    Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.

Servant

    He did receive his letters, and is coming;
    And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
    O Caesar!--

    Seeing the body

ANTONY

    Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
    Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
    Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
    Began to water. Is thy master coming?

Servant

    He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.

ANTONY

    Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:
    Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
    No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
    Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
    Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
    Into the market-place: there shall I try
    In my oration, how the people take
    The cruel issue of these bloody men;
    According to the which, thou shalt discourse
    To young Octavius of the state of things.
    Lend me your hand.

    Exeunt with CAESAR's body

SCENE II. The Forum.

    Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens

Citizens

    We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.

BRUTUS

    Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
    Cassius, go you into the other street,
    And part the numbers.
    Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
    Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
    And public reasons shall be rendered
    Of Caesar's death.

First Citizen

    I will hear Brutus speak.

Second Citizen

    I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,
    When severally we hear them rendered.

    Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit

Third Citizen

    The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!

BRUTUS

    Be patient till the last.
    Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
    cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
    for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
    you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
    awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
    If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
    Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
    was no less than his. If then that friend demand
    why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
    --Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
    Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
    die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
    all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
    as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
    valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
    slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
    fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
    ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
    bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
    Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
    any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
    vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
    for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.

All

    None, Brutus, none.

BRUTUS

    Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
    Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
    his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
    extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
    enforced, for which he suffered death.

    Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body
    Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
    though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
    the benefit of his dying, a place in the
    commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
    I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
    good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
    when it shall please my country to need my death.

All

    Live, Brutus! live, live!

First Citizen

    Bring him with triumph home unto his house.

Second Citizen

    Give him a statue with his ancestors.

Third Citizen

    Let him be Caesar.

Fourth Citizen

    Caesar's better parts
    Shall be crown'd in Brutus.

First Citizen

    We'll bring him to his house
    With shouts and clamours.

BRUTUS

    My countrymen,--

Second Citizen

    Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.

First Citizen

    Peace, ho!

BRUTUS

    Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
    And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
    Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
    Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,
    By our permission, is allow'd to make.
    I do entreat you, not a man depart,
    Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.

    Exit

First Citizen

    Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.

Third Citizen

    Let him go up into the public chair;
    We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.

ANTONY

    For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.

    Goes into the pulpit

Fourth Citizen

    What does he say of Brutus?

Third Citizen

    He says, for Brutus' sake,
    He finds himself beholding to us all.

Fourth Citizen

    'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.

First Citizen

    This Caesar was a tyrant.

Third Citizen

    Nay, that's certain:
    We are blest that Rome is rid of him.

Second Citizen

    Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.

ANTONY

    You gentle Romans,--

Citizens

    Peace, ho! let us hear him.

ANTONY

    Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
    I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
    The evil that men do lives after them;
    The good is oft interred with their bones;
    So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
    Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
    If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
    And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
    Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
    For Brutus is an honourable man;
    So are they all, all honourable men--
    Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
    He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
    But Brutus says he was ambitious;
    And Brutus is an honourable man.
    He hath brought many captives home to Rome
    Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
    Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
    When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
    Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
    And Brutus is an honourable man.
    You all did see that on the Lupercal
    I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
    Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
    Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
    And, sure, he is an honourable man.
    I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
    But here I am to speak what I do know.
    You all did love him once, not without cause:
    What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
    O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
    And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
    My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
    And I must pause till it come back to me.

First Citizen

    Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.

Second Citizen

    If thou consider rightly of the matter,
    Caesar has had great wrong.

Third Citizen

    Has he, masters?
    I fear there will a worse come in his place.

Fourth Citizen

    Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
    Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.

First Citizen

    If it be found so, some will dear abide it.

Second Citizen

    Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.

Third Citizen

    There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.

Fourth Citizen

    Now mark him, he begins again to speak.

ANTONY

    But yesterday the word of Caesar might
    Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
    And none so poor to do him reverence.
    O masters, if I were disposed to stir
    Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
    I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
    Who, you all know, are honourable men:
    I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
    To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
    Than I will wrong such honourable men.
    But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
    I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
    Let but the commons hear this testament--
    Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
    And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
    And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
    Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
    And, dying, mention it within their wills,
    Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
    Unto their issue.

Fourth Citizen

    We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.

All

    The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.

ANTONY

    Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
    It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
    You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
    And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
    It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
    'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
    For, if you should, O, what would come of it!

Fourth Citizen

    Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;
    You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.

ANTONY

    Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
    I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
    I fear I wrong the honourable men
    Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.

Fourth Citizen

    They were traitors: honourable men!

All

    The will! the testament!

Second Citizen

    They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.

ANTONY

    You will compel me, then, to read the will?
    Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
    And let me show you him that made the will.
    Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?

Several Citizens

    Come down.

Second Citizen

    Descend.

Third Citizen

    You shall have leave.

    ANTONY comes down

Fourth Citizen

    A ring; stand round.

First Citizen

    Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.

Second Citizen

    Room for Antony, most noble Antony.

ANTONY

    Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.

Several Citizens

    Stand back; room; bear back.

ANTONY

    If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
    You all do know this mantle: I remember
    The first time ever Caesar put it on;
    'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
    That day he overcame the Nervii:
    Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
    See what a rent the envious Casca made:
    Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
    And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
    Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
    As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
    If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
    For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
    Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
    This was the most unkindest cut of all;
    For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
    Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
    Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
    And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
    Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
    Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
    O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
    Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
    Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
    O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
    The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
    Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
    Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
    Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.

First Citizen

    O piteous spectacle!

Second Citizen

    O noble Caesar!

Third Citizen

    O woful day!

Fourth Citizen

    O traitors, villains!

First Citizen

    O most bloody sight!

Second Citizen

    We will be revenged.

All

    Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
    Let not a traitor live!

ANTONY

    Stay, countrymen.

First Citizen

    Peace there! hear the noble Antony.

Second Citizen

    We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.

ANTONY

    Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
    To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
    They that have done this deed are honourable:
    What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
    That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
    And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
    I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
    I am no orator, as Brutus is;
    But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
    That love my friend; and that they know full well
    That gave me public leave to speak of him:
    For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
    Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
    To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
    I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
    Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
    And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
    And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
    Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
    In every wound of Caesar that should move
    The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.

All

    We'll mutiny.

First Citizen

    We'll burn the house of Brutus.

Third Citizen

    Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.

ANTONY

    Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.

All

    Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!

ANTONY

    Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
    Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
    Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
    You have forgot the will I told you of.

All

    Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.

ANTONY

    Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
    To every Roman citizen he gives,
    To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.

Second Citizen

    Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.

Third Citizen

    O royal Caesar!

ANTONY

    Hear me with patience.

All

    Peace, ho!

ANTONY

    Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
    His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
    On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
    And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
    To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
    Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?

First Citizen

    Never, never. Come, away, away!
    We'll burn his body in the holy place,
    And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
    Take up the body.

Second Citizen

    Go fetch fire.

Third Citizen

    Pluck down benches.

Fourth Citizen

    Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.

    Exeunt Citizens with the body

ANTONY

    Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
    Take thou what course thou wilt!

    Enter a Servant
    How now, fellow!

Servant

    Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.

ANTONY

    Where is he?

Servant

    He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.

ANTONY

    And thither will I straight to visit him:
    He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
    And in this mood will give us any thing.

Servant

    I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
    Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.

ANTONY

    Belike they had some notice of the people,
    How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A street.

    Enter CINNA the poet

CINNA THE POET

    I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
    And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
    I have no will to wander forth of doors,
    Yet something leads me forth.

    Enter Citizens

First Citizen

    What is your name?

Second Citizen

    Whither are you going?

Third Citizen

    Where do you dwell?

Fourth Citizen

    Are you a married man or a bachelor?

Second Citizen

    Answer every man directly.

First Citizen

    Ay, and briefly.

Fourth Citizen

    Ay, and wisely.

Third Citizen

    Ay, and truly, you were best.

CINNA THE POET

    What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
    dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to
    answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and
    truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.

Second Citizen

    That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:
    you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.

CINNA THE POET

    Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.

First Citizen

    As a friend or an enemy?

CINNA THE POET

    As a friend.

Second Citizen

    That matter is answered directly.

Fourth Citizen

    For your dwelling,--briefly.

CINNA THE POET

    Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.

Third Citizen

    Your name, sir, truly.

CINNA THE POET

    Truly, my name is Cinna.

First Citizen

    Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.

CINNA THE POET

    I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.

Fourth Citizen

    Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.

CINNA THE POET

    I am not Cinna the conspirator.

Fourth Citizen

    It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his
    name out of his heart, and turn him going.

Third Citizen

    Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands:
    to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius'
    house, and some to Casca's; some to Ligarius': away, go!

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. A house in Rome.

    ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table

ANTONY

    These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.

OCTAVIUS

    Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?

LEPIDUS

    I do consent--

OCTAVIUS

    Prick him down, Antony.

LEPIDUS

    Upon condition Publius shall not live,
    Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.

ANTONY

    He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
    But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;
    Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
    How to cut off some charge in legacies.

LEPIDUS

    What, shall I find you here?

OCTAVIUS

    Or here, or at the Capitol.

    Exit LEPIDUS

ANTONY

    This is a slight unmeritable man,
    Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
    The three-fold world divided, he should stand
    One of the three to share it?

OCTAVIUS

    So you thought him;
    And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,
    In our black sentence and proscription.

ANTONY

    Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
    And though we lay these honours on this man,
    To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
    He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
    To groan and sweat under the business,
    Either led or driven, as we point the way;
    And having brought our treasure where we will,
    Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
    Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
    And graze in commons.

OCTAVIUS

    You may do your will;
    But he's a tried and valiant soldier.

ANTONY

    So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
    I do appoint him store of provender:
    It is a creature that I teach to fight,
    To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
    His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
    And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
    He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
    A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
    On abjects, orts and imitations,
    Which, out of use and staled by other men,
    Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
    But as a property. And now, Octavius,
    Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
    Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
    Therefore let our alliance be combined,
    Our best friends made, our means stretch'd
    And let us presently go sit in council,
    How covert matters may be best disclosed,
    And open perils surest answered.

OCTAVIUS

    Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
    And bay'd about with many enemies;
    And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
    Millions of mischiefs.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Camp near Sardis. Before BRUTUS's tent.

    Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them

BRUTUS

    Stand, ho!

LUCILIUS

    Give the word, ho! and stand.

BRUTUS

    What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?

LUCILIUS

    He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
    To do you salutation from his master.

BRUTUS

    He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
    In his own change, or by ill officers,
    Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
    Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
    I shall be satisfied.

PINDARUS

    I do not doubt
    But that my noble master will appear
    Such as he is, full of regard and honour.

BRUTUS

    He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
    How he received you, let me be resolved.

LUCILIUS

    With courtesy and with respect enough;
    But not with such familiar instances,
    Nor with such free and friendly conference,
    As he hath used of old.

BRUTUS

    Thou hast described
    A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
    When love begins to sicken and decay,
    It useth an enforced ceremony.
    There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
    But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
    Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
    But when they should endure the bloody spur,
    They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
    Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?

LUCILIUS

    They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;
    The greater part, the horse in general,
    Are come with Cassius.

BRUTUS

    Hark! he is arrived.

    Low march within
    March gently on to meet him.

    Enter CASSIUS and his powers

CASSIUS

    Stand, ho!

BRUTUS

    Stand, ho! Speak the word along.

First Soldier

    Stand!

Second Soldier

    Stand!

Third Soldier

    Stand!

CASSIUS

    Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.

BRUTUS

    Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
    And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?

CASSIUS

    Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
    And when you do them--

BRUTUS

    Cassius, be content.
    Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
    Before the eyes of both our armies here,
    Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
    Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
    Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
    And I will give you audience.

CASSIUS

    Pindarus,
    Bid our commanders lead their charges off
    A little from this ground.

BRUTUS

    Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
    Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
    Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Brutus's tent.

    Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS

CASSIUS

    That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
    You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
    For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
    Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
    Because I knew the man, were slighted off.

BRUTUS

    You wronged yourself to write in such a case.

CASSIUS

    In such a time as this it is not meet
    That every nice offence should bear his comment.

BRUTUS

    Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
    Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
    To sell and mart your offices for gold
    To undeservers.

CASSIUS

    I an itching palm!
    You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
    Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.

BRUTUS

    The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
    And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.

CASSIUS

    Chastisement!

BRUTUS

    Remember March, the ides of March remember:
    Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
    What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
    And not for justice? What, shall one of us
    That struck the foremost man of all this world
    But for supporting robbers, shall we now
    Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
    And sell the mighty space of our large honours
    For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
    I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
    Than such a Roman.

CASSIUS

    Brutus, bay not me;
    I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
    To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
    Older in practise, abler than yourself
    To make conditions.

BRUTUS

    Go to; you are not, Cassius.

CASSIUS

    I am.

BRUTUS

    I say you are not.

CASSIUS

    Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
    Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.

BRUTUS

    Away, slight man!

CASSIUS

    Is't possible?

BRUTUS

    Hear me, for I will speak.
    Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
    Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?

CASSIUS

    O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?

BRUTUS

    All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
    Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
    And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
    Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
    Under your testy humour? By the gods
    You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
    Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
    I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
    When you are waspish.

CASSIUS

    Is it come to this?

BRUTUS

    You say you are a better soldier:
    Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
    And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
    I shall be glad to learn of noble men.

CASSIUS

    You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
    I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
    Did I say 'better'?

BRUTUS

    If you did, I care not.

CASSIUS

    When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.

BRUTUS

    Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.

CASSIUS

    I durst not!

BRUTUS

    No.

CASSIUS

    What, durst not tempt him!

BRUTUS

    For your life you durst not!

CASSIUS

    Do not presume too much upon my love;
    I may do that I shall be sorry for.

BRUTUS

    You have done that you should be sorry for.
    There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
    For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
    That they pass by me as the idle wind,
    Which I respect not. I did send to you
    For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
    For I can raise no money by vile means:
    By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
    And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
    From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
    By any indirection: I did send
    To you for gold to pay my legions,
    Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
    Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
    When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
    To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
    Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
    Dash him to pieces!

CASSIUS

    I denied you not.

BRUTUS

    You did.

CASSIUS

    I did not: he was but a fool that brought
    My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
    A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
    But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.

BRUTUS

    I do not, till you practise them on me.

CASSIUS

    You love me not.

BRUTUS

    I do not like your faults.

CASSIUS

    A friendly eye could never see such faults.

BRUTUS

    A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
    As huge as high Olympus.

CASSIUS

    Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
    Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
    For Cassius is aweary of the world;
    Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
    Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
    Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
    To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
    My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
    And here my naked breast; within, a heart
    Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
    If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
    I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
    Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
    When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
    Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.

BRUTUS

    Sheathe your dagger:
    Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
    Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
    O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
    That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
    Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
    And straight is cold again.

CASSIUS

    Hath Cassius lived
    To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
    When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?

BRUTUS

    When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.

CASSIUS

    Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.

BRUTUS

    And my heart too.

CASSIUS

    O Brutus!

BRUTUS

    What's the matter?

CASSIUS

    Have not you love enough to bear with me,
    When that rash humour which my mother gave me
    Makes me forgetful?

BRUTUS

    Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,
    When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
    He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.

Poet

    [Within] Let me go in to see the generals;
    There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
    They be alone.

LUCILIUS

    [Within] You shall not come to them.

Poet

    [Within] Nothing but death shall stay me.

    Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS

CASSIUS

    How now! what's the matter?

Poet

    For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
    Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
    For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.

CASSIUS

    Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!

BRUTUS

    Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!

CASSIUS

    Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.

BRUTUS

    I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
    What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
    Companion, hence!

CASSIUS

    Away, away, be gone.

    Exit Poet

BRUTUS

    Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
    Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.

CASSIUS

    And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
    Immediately to us.

    Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS

BRUTUS

    Lucius, a bowl of wine!

    Exit LUCIUS

CASSIUS

    I did not think you could have been so angry.

BRUTUS

    O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.

CASSIUS

    Of your philosophy you make no use,
    If you give place to accidental evils.

BRUTUS

    No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.

CASSIUS

    Ha! Portia!

BRUTUS

    She is dead.

CASSIUS

    How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
    O insupportable and touching loss!
    Upon what sickness?

BRUTUS

    Impatient of my absence,
    And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
    Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
    That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,
    And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.

CASSIUS

    And died so?

BRUTUS

    Even so.

CASSIUS

    O ye immortal gods!

    Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper

BRUTUS

    Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
    In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.

CASSIUS

    My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
    Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
    I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.

BRUTUS

    Come in, Titinius!

    Exit LUCIUS

    Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA
    Welcome, good Messala.
    Now sit we close about this taper here,
    And call in question our necessities.

CASSIUS

    Portia, art thou gone?

BRUTUS

    No more, I pray you.
    Messala, I have here received letters,
    That young Octavius and Mark Antony
    Come down upon us with a mighty power,
    Bending their expedition toward Philippi.

MESSALA

    Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.

BRUTUS

    With what addition?

MESSALA

    That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
    Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
    Have put to death an hundred senators.

BRUTUS

    Therein our letters do not well agree;
    Mine speak of seventy senators that died
    By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.

CASSIUS

    Cicero one!

MESSALA

    Cicero is dead,
    And by that order of proscription.
    Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?

BRUTUS

    No, Messala.

MESSALA

    Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?

BRUTUS

    Nothing, Messala.

MESSALA

    That, methinks, is strange.

BRUTUS

    Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?

MESSALA

    No, my lord.

BRUTUS

    Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.

MESSALA

    Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
    For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.

BRUTUS

    Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
    With meditating that she must die once,
    I have the patience to endure it now.

MESSALA

    Even so great men great losses should endure.

CASSIUS

    I have as much of this in art as you,
    But yet my nature could not bear it so.

BRUTUS

    Well, to our work alive. What do you think
    Of marching to Philippi presently?

CASSIUS

    I do not think it good.

BRUTUS

    Your reason?

CASSIUS

    This it is:
    'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
    So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
    Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
    Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.

BRUTUS

    Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
    The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
    Do stand but in a forced affection;
    For they have grudged us contribution:
    The enemy, marching along by them,
    By them shall make a fuller number up,
    Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
    From which advantage shall we cut him off,
    If at Philippi we do face him there,
    These people at our back.

CASSIUS

    Hear me, good brother.

BRUTUS

    Under your pardon. You must note beside,
    That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
    Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
    The enemy increaseth every day;
    We, at the height, are ready to decline.
    There is a tide in the affairs of men,
    Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
    Omitted, all the voyage of their life
    Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
    On such a full sea are we now afloat;
    And we must take the current when it serves,
    Or lose our ventures.

CASSIUS

    Then, with your will, go on;
    We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.

BRUTUS

    The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
    And nature must obey necessity;
    Which we will niggard with a little rest.
    There is no more to say?

CASSIUS

    No more. Good night:
    Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.

BRUTUS

    Lucius!

    Enter LUCIUS
    My gown.

    Exit LUCIUS
    Farewell, good Messala:
    Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
    Good night, and good repose.

CASSIUS

    O my dear brother!
    This was an ill beginning of the night:
    Never come such division 'tween our souls!
    Let it not, Brutus.

BRUTUS

    Every thing is well.

CASSIUS

    Good night, my lord.

BRUTUS

    Good night, good brother.

TITINIUS MESSALA

    Good night, Lord Brutus.

BRUTUS

    Farewell, every one.

    Exeunt all but BRUTUS

    Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown
    Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?

LUCIUS

    Here in the tent.

BRUTUS

    What, thou speak'st drowsily?
    Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.
    Call Claudius and some other of my men:
    I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.

LUCIUS

    Varro and Claudius!

    Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS

VARRO

    Calls my lord?

BRUTUS

    I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
    It may be I shall raise you by and by
    On business to my brother Cassius.

VARRO

    So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.

BRUTUS

    I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
    It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
    Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
    I put it in the pocket of my gown.

    VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down

LUCIUS

    I was sure your lordship did not give it me.

BRUTUS

    Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
    Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
    And touch thy instrument a strain or two?

LUCIUS

    Ay, my lord, an't please you.

BRUTUS

    It does, my boy:
    I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.

LUCIUS

    It is my duty, sir.

BRUTUS

    I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
    I know young bloods look for a time of rest.

LUCIUS

    I have slept, my lord, already.

BRUTUS

    It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
    I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
    I will be good to thee.

    Music, and a song
    This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
    Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
    That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
    I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
    If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
    I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
    Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
    Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.

    Enter the Ghost of CAESAR
    How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
    I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
    That shapes this monstrous apparition.
    It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
    Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
    That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
    Speak to me what thou art.

GHOST

    Thy evil spirit, Brutus.

BRUTUS

    Why comest thou?

GHOST

    To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.

BRUTUS

    Well; then I shall see thee again?

GHOST

    Ay, at Philippi.

BRUTUS

    Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.

    Exit Ghost
    Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
    Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
    Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!

LUCIUS

    The strings, my lord, are false.

BRUTUS

    He thinks he still is at his instrument.
    Lucius, awake!

LUCIUS

    My lord?

BRUTUS

    Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?

LUCIUS

    My lord, I do not know that I did cry.

BRUTUS

    Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?

LUCIUS

    Nothing, my lord.

BRUTUS

    Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!

    To VARRO
    Fellow thou, awake!

VARRO

    My lord?

CLAUDIUS

    My lord?

BRUTUS

    Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?

VARRO CLAUDIUS

    Did we, my lord?

BRUTUS

    Ay: saw you any thing?

VARRO

    No, my lord, I saw nothing.

CLAUDIUS

    Nor I, my lord.

BRUTUS

    Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
    Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
    And we will follow.

VARRO CLAUDIUS

    It shall be done, my lord.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. The plains of Philippi.

    Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army

OCTAVIUS

    Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:
    You said the enemy would not come down,
    But keep the hills and upper regions;
    It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
    They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
    Answering before we do demand of them.

ANTONY

    Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
    Wherefore they do it: they could be content
    To visit other places; and come down
    With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
    To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
    But 'tis not so.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    Prepare you, generals:
    The enemy comes on in gallant show;
    Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
    And something to be done immediately.

ANTONY

    Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
    Upon the left hand of the even field.

OCTAVIUS

    Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.

ANTONY

    Why do you cross me in this exigent?

OCTAVIUS

    I do not cross you; but I will do so.

    March

    Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army; LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others

BRUTUS

    They stand, and would have parley.

CASSIUS

    Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.

OCTAVIUS

    Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?

ANTONY

    No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
    Make forth; the generals would have some words.

OCTAVIUS

    Stir not until the signal.

BRUTUS

    Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?

OCTAVIUS

    Not that we love words better, as you do.

BRUTUS

    Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.

ANTONY

    In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
    Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
    Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'

CASSIUS

    Antony,
    The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
    But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
    And leave them honeyless.

ANTONY

    Not stingless too.

BRUTUS

    O, yes, and soundless too;
    For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
    And very wisely threat before you sting.

ANTONY

    Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers
    Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
    You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
    And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
    Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
    Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!

CASSIUS

    Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
    This tongue had not offended so to-day,
    If Cassius might have ruled.

OCTAVIUS

    Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,
    The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;
    I draw a sword against conspirators;
    When think you that the sword goes up again?
    Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
    Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
    Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.

BRUTUS

    Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
    Unless thou bring'st them with thee.

OCTAVIUS

    So I hope;
    I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.

BRUTUS

    O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
    Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.

CASSIUS

    A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
    Join'd with a masker and a reveller!

ANTONY

    Old Cassius still!

OCTAVIUS

    Come, Antony, away!
    Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
    If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
    If not, when you have stomachs.

    Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army

CASSIUS

    Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
    The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.

BRUTUS

    Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.

LUCILIUS

    [Standing forth] My lord?

    BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart

CASSIUS

    Messala!

MESSALA

    [Standing forth] What says my general?

CASSIUS

    Messala,
    This is my birth-day; as this very day
    Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
    Be thou my witness that against my will,
    As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
    Upon one battle all our liberties.
    You know that I held Epicurus strong
    And his opinion: now I change my mind,
    And partly credit things that do presage.
    Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
    Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
    Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
    Who to Philippi here consorted us:
    This morning are they fled away and gone;
    And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
    Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
    As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
    A canopy most fatal, under which
    Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.

MESSALA

    Believe not so.

CASSIUS

    I but believe it partly;
    For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
    To meet all perils very constantly.

BRUTUS

    Even so, Lucilius.

CASSIUS

    Now, most noble Brutus,
    The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
    Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
    But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
    Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
    If we do lose this battle, then is this
    The very last time we shall speak together:
    What are you then determined to do?

BRUTUS

    Even by the rule of that philosophy
    By which I did blame Cato for the death
    Which he did give himself, I know not how,
    But I do find it cowardly and vile,
    For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
    The time of life: arming myself with patience
    To stay the providence of some high powers
    That govern us below.

CASSIUS

    Then, if we lose this battle,
    You are contented to be led in triumph
    Thorough the streets of Rome?

BRUTUS

    No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
    That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
    He bears too great a mind. But this same day
    Must end that work the ides of March begun;
    And whether we shall meet again I know not.
    Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
    For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
    If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
    If not, why then, this parting was well made.

CASSIUS

    For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
    If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
    If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.

BRUTUS

    Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
    The end of this day's business ere it come!
    But it sufficeth that the day will end,
    And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. The field of battle.

    Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA

BRUTUS

    Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
    Unto the legions on the other side.

    Loud alarum
    Let them set on at once; for I perceive
    But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
    And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
    Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Another part of the field.

    Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS

CASSIUS

    O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
    Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:
    This ensign here of mine was turning back;
    I slew the coward, and did take it from him.

TITINIUS

    O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
    Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
    Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
    Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.

    Enter PINDARUS

PINDARUS

    Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
    Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord
    Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.

CASSIUS

    This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;
    Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?

TITINIUS

    They are, my lord.

CASSIUS

    Titinius, if thou lovest me,
    Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
    Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
    And here again; that I may rest assured
    Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.

TITINIUS

    I will be here again, even with a thought.

    Exit

CASSIUS

    Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
    My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
    And tell me what thou notest about the field.

    PINDARUS ascends the hill
    This day I breathed first: time is come round,
    And where I did begin, there shall I end;
    My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?

PINDARUS

    [Above] O my lord!

CASSIUS

    What news?

PINDARUS

    [Above] Titinius is enclosed round about
    With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
    Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
    Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
    He's ta'en.

    Shout
    And, hark! they shout for joy.

CASSIUS

    Come down, behold no more.
    O, coward that I am, to live so long,
    To see my best friend ta'en before my face!

    PINDARUS descends
    Come hither, sirrah:
    In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
    And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
    That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
    Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
    Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
    That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
    Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
    And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
    Guide thou the sword.

    PINDARUS stabs him
    Caesar, thou art revenged,
    Even with the sword that kill'd thee.

    Dies

PINDARUS

    So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
    Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
    Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
    Where never Roman shall take note of him.

    Exit

    Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA

MESSALA

    It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
    Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
    As Cassius' legions are by Antony.

TITINIUS

    These tidings will well comfort Cassius.

MESSALA

    Where did you leave him?

TITINIUS

    All disconsolate,
    With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.

MESSALA

    Is not that he t hat lies upon the ground?

TITINIUS

    He lies not like the living. O my heart!

MESSALA

    Is not that he?

TITINIUS

    No, this was he, Messala,
    But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
    As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
    So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;
    The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
    Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
    Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.

MESSALA

    Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
    O hateful error, melancholy's child,
    Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
    The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
    Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
    But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!

TITINIUS

    What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?

MESSALA

    Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
    The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
    Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;
    For piercing steel and darts envenomed
    Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
    As tidings of this sight.

TITINIUS

    Hie you, Messala,
    And I will seek for Pindarus the while.

    Exit MESSALA
    Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
    Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
    Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
    And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
    Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
    But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
    Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
    Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
    And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
    By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part
    Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.

    Kills himself

    Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO, STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS

BRUTUS

    Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?

MESSALA

    Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.

BRUTUS

    Titinius' face is upward.

CATO

    He is slain.

BRUTUS

    O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
    Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
    In our own proper entrails.

    Low alarums

CATO

    Brave Titinius!
    Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!

BRUTUS

    Are yet two Romans living such as these?
    The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
    It is impossible that ever Rome
    Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
    To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
    I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
    Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
    His funerals shall not be in our camp,
    Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
    And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
    Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
    'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
    We shall try fortune in a second fight.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Another part of the field.

    Alarum. Enter fighting, Soldiers of both armies; then BRUTUS, CATO, LUCILIUS, and others

BRUTUS

    Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!

CATO

    What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
    I will proclaim my name about the field:
    I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
    A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
    I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!

BRUTUS

    And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
    Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!

    Exit

LUCILIUS

    O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
    Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;
    And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.

First Soldier

    Yield, or thou diest.

LUCILIUS

    Only I yield to die:
    There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;

    Offering money
    Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.

First Soldier

    We must not. A noble prisoner!

Second Soldier

    Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.

First Soldier

    I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.

    Enter ANTONY
    Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.

ANTONY

    Where is he?

LUCILIUS

    Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
    I dare assure thee that no enemy
    Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
    The gods defend him from so great a shame!
    When you do find him, or alive or dead,
    He will be found like Brutus, like himself.

ANTONY

    This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
    A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
    Give him all kindness: I had rather have
    Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
    And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
    And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
    How every thing is chanced.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Another part of the field.

    Enter BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and VOLUMNIUS

BRUTUS

    Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.

CLITUS

    Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
    He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.

BRUTUS

    Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
    It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.

    Whispers

CLITUS

    What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.

BRUTUS

    Peace then! no words.

CLITUS

    I'll rather kill myself.

BRUTUS

    Hark thee, Dardanius.

    Whispers

DARDANIUS

    Shall I do such a deed?

CLITUS

    O Dardanius!

DARDANIUS

    O Clitus!

CLITUS

    What ill request did Brutus make to thee?

DARDANIUS

    To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.

CLITUS

    Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
    That it runs over even at his eyes.

BRUTUS

    Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.

VOLUMNIUS

    What says my lord?

BRUTUS

    Why, this, Volumnius:
    The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
    Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
    And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
    I know my hour is come.

VOLUMNIUS

    Not so, my lord.

BRUTUS

    Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
    Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
    Our enemies have beat us to the pit:

    Low alarums
    It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
    Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
    Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
    Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
    Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.

VOLUMNIUS

    That's not an office for a friend, my lord.

    Alarum still

CLITUS

    Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.

BRUTUS

    Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
    Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
    Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
    My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
    I found no man but he was true to me.
    I shall have glory by this losing day
    More than Octavius and Mark Antony
    By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
    So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
    Hath almost ended his life's history:
    Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
    That have but labour'd to attain this hour.

    Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!'

CLITUS

    Fly, my lord, fly.

BRUTUS

    Hence! I will follow.

    Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS
    I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
    Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
    Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
    Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
    While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?

STRATO

    Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.

BRUTUS

    Farewell, good Strato.

    Runs on his sword
    Caesar, now be still:
    I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.

    Dies

    Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA, LUCILIUS, and the army

OCTAVIUS

    What man is that?

MESSALA

    My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?

STRATO

    Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
    The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
    For Brutus only overcame himself,
    And no man else hath honour by his death.

LUCILIUS

    So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
    That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.

OCTAVIUS

    All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
    Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?

STRATO

    Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.

OCTAVIUS

    Do so, good Messala.

MESSALA

    How died my master, Strato?

STRATO

    I held the sword, and he did run on it.

MESSALA

    Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
    That did the latest service to my master.

ANTONY

    This was the noblest Roman of them all:
    All the conspirators save only he
    Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
    He only, in a general honest thought
    And common good to all, made one of them.
    His life was gentle, and the elements
    So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
    And say to all the world 'This was a man!'

OCTAVIUS

    According to his virtue let us use him,
    With all respect and rites of burial.
    Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
    Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.
    So call the field to rest; and let's away,
    To part the glories of this happy day.

    Exeunt


King Lear

ACT I
SCENE I. King Lear's palace.

    Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND

KENT

    I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
    Albany than Cornwall.

GLOUCESTER

    It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
    division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
    the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
    weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
    of either's moiety.

KENT

    Is not this your son, my lord?

GLOUCESTER

    His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
    so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
    brazed to it.

KENT

    I cannot conceive you.

GLOUCESTER

    Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon
    she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
    for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
    Do you smell a fault?

KENT

    I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
    being so proper.

GLOUCESTER

    But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
    elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
    though this knave came something saucily into the
    world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
    fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
    whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
    noble gentleman, Edmund?

EDMUND

    No, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

    My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
    honourable friend.

EDMUND

    My services to your lordship.

KENT

    I must love you, and sue to know you better.

EDMUND

    Sir, I shall study deserving.

GLOUCESTER

    He hath been out nine years, and away he shall
    again. The king is coming.

    Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants

KING LEAR

    Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.

GLOUCESTER

    I shall, my liege.

    Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND

KING LEAR

    Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
    Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
    In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
    To shake all cares and business from our age;
    Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
    Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
    And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
    We have this hour a constant will to publish
    Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
    May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
    Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
    Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
    And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
    Since now we will divest us both of rule,
    Interest of territory, cares of state,--
    Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
    That we our largest bounty may extend
    Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
    Our eldest-born, speak first.

GONERIL

    Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
    Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
    Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
    No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
    As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
    A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
    Beyond all manner of so much I love you.

CORDELIA

    [Aside] What shall Cordelia do?
    Love, and be silent.

LEAR

    Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
    With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
    With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
    We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
    Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
    Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.

REGAN

    Sir, I am made
    Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
    And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
    I find she names my very deed of love;
    Only she comes too short: that I profess
    Myself an enemy to all other joys,
    Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
    And find I am alone felicitate
    In your dear highness' love.

CORDELIA

    [Aside] Then poor Cordelia!
    And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
    More richer than my tongue.

KING LEAR

    To thee and thine hereditary ever
    Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
    No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
    Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
    Although the last, not least; to whose young love
    The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
    Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
    A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.

CORDELIA

    Nothing, my lord.

KING LEAR

    Nothing!

CORDELIA

    Nothing.

KING LEAR

    Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.

CORDELIA

    Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
    My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
    According to my bond; nor more nor less.

KING LEAR

    How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
    Lest it may mar your fortunes.

CORDELIA

    Good my lord,
    You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
    Return those duties back as are right fit,
    Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
    Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
    They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
    That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
    Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
    Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
    To love my father all.

KING LEAR

    But goes thy heart with this?

CORDELIA

    Ay, good my lord.

KING LEAR

    So young, and so untender?

CORDELIA

    So young, my lord, and true.

KING LEAR

    Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
    For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
    The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
    By all the operation of the orbs
    From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
    Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
    Propinquity and property of blood,
    And as a stranger to my heart and me
    Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
    Or he that makes his generation messes
    To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
    Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
    As thou my sometime daughter.

KENT

    Good my liege,--

KING LEAR

    Peace, Kent!
    Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
    I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
    On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
    So be my grave my peace, as here I give
    Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
    Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
    With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
    Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
    I do invest you jointly with my power,
    Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
    That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
    With reservation of an hundred knights,
    By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
    Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
    The name, and all the additions to a king;
    The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
    Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
    This coronet part betwixt you.

    Giving the crown

KENT

    Royal Lear,
    Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
    Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
    As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--

KING LEAR

    The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.

KENT

    Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
    The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
    When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
    Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
    When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,
    When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;
    And, in thy best consideration, cheque
    This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
    Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
    Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
    Reverbs no hollowness.

KING LEAR

    Kent, on thy life, no more.

KENT

    My life I never held but as a pawn
    To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,
    Thy safety being the motive.

KING LEAR

    Out of my sight!

KENT

    See better, Lear; and let me still remain
    The true blank of thine eye.

KING LEAR

    Now, by Apollo,--

KENT

    Now, by Apollo, king,
    Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.

KING LEAR

    O, vassal! miscreant!

    Laying his hand on his sword

ALBANY CORNWALL

    Dear sir, forbear.

KENT

    Do:
    Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
    Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
    Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
    I'll tell thee thou dost evil.

KING LEAR

    Hear me, recreant!
    On thine allegiance, hear me!
    Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
    Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
    To come between our sentence and our power,
    Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
    Our potency made good, take thy reward.
    Five days we do allot thee, for provision
    To shield thee from diseases of the world;
    And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
    Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
    Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
    The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
    This shall not be revoked.

KENT

    Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
    Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.

    To CORDELIA
    The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
    That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!

    To REGAN and GONERIL
    And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
    That good effects may spring from words of love.
    Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
    He'll shape his old course in a country new.

    Exit

    Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE, BURGUNDY, and Attendants

GLOUCESTER

    Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.

KING LEAR

    My lord of Burgundy.
    We first address towards you, who with this king
    Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
    Will you require in present dower with her,
    Or cease your quest of love?

BURGUNDY

    Most royal majesty,
    I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
    Nor will you tender less.

KING LEAR

    Right noble Burgundy,
    When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
    But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
    If aught within that little seeming substance,
    Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
    And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
    She's there, and she is yours.

BURGUNDY

    I know no answer.

KING LEAR

    Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
    Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
    Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
    Take her, or leave her?

BURGUNDY

    Pardon me, royal sir;
    Election makes not up on such conditions.

KING LEAR

    Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
    I tell you all her wealth.

    To KING OF FRANCE
    For you, great king,
    I would not from your love make such a stray,
    To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
    To avert your liking a more worthier way
    Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
    Almost to acknowledge hers.

KING OF FRANCE

    This is most strange,
    That she, that even but now was your best object,
    The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
    Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
    Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
    So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
    Must be of such unnatural degree,
    That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
    Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
    Must be a faith that reason without miracle
    Could never plant in me.

CORDELIA

    I yet beseech your majesty,--
    If for I want that glib and oily art,
    To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
    I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
    It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
    No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
    That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
    But even for want of that for which I am richer,
    A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
    As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
    Hath lost me in your liking.

KING LEAR

    Better thou
    Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.

KING OF FRANCE

    Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
    Which often leaves the history unspoke
    That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
    What say you to the lady? Love's not love
    When it is mingled with regards that stand
    Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
    She is herself a dowry.

BURGUNDY

    Royal Lear,
    Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
    And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
    Duchess of Burgundy.

KING LEAR

    Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.

BURGUNDY

    I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
    That you must lose a husband.

CORDELIA

    Peace be with Burgundy!
    Since that respects of fortune are his love,
    I shall not be his wife.

KING OF FRANCE

    Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
    Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!
    Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
    Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
    Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
    My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
    Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
    Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
    Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
    Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
    Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
    Thou losest here, a better where to find.

KING LEAR

    Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
    Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
    That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
    Without our grace, our love, our benison.
    Come, noble Burgundy.

    Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL, REGAN, and CORDELIA

KING OF FRANCE

    Bid farewell to your sisters.

CORDELIA

    The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
    Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
    And like a sister am most loath to call
    Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
    To your professed bosoms I commit him
    But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
    I would prefer him to a better place.
    So, farewell to you both.

REGAN

    Prescribe not us our duties.

GONERIL

    Let your study
    Be to content your lord, who hath received you
    At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
    And well are worth the want that you have wanted.

CORDELIA

    Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
    Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
    Well may you prosper!

KING OF FRANCE

    Come, my fair Cordelia.

    Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA

GONERIL

    Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what
    most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
    father will hence to-night.

REGAN

    That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.

GONERIL

    You see how full of changes his age is; the
    observation we have made of it hath not been
    little: he always loved our sister most; and
    with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
    appears too grossly.

REGAN

    'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
    but slenderly known himself.

GONERIL

    The best and soundest of his time hath been but
    rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
    not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
    condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
    that infirm and choleric years bring with them.

REGAN

    Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
    him as this of Kent's banishment.

GONERIL

    There is further compliment of leavetaking
    between France and him. Pray you, let's hit
    together: if our father carry authority with
    such dispositions as he bears, this last
    surrender of his will but offend us.

REGAN

    We shall further think on't.

GONERIL

    We must do something, and i' the heat.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The Earl of Gloucester's castle.

    Enter EDMUND, with a letter

EDMUND

    Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
    My services are bound. Wherefore should I
    Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
    The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
    For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
    Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
    When my dimensions are as well compact,
    My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
    As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
    With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
    Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
    More composition and fierce quality
    Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
    Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
    Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,
    Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
    Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
    As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!
    Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
    And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
    Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:
    Now, gods, stand up for bastards!

    Enter GLOUCESTER

GLOUCESTER

    Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!
    And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!
    Confined to exhibition! All this done
    Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?

EDMUND

    So please your lordship, none.

    Putting up the letter

GLOUCESTER

    Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?

EDMUND

    I know no news, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

    What paper were you reading?

EDMUND

    Nothing, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

    No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of
    it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath
    not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,
    if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.

EDMUND

    I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter
    from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;
    and for so much as I have perused, I find it not
    fit for your o'er-looking.

GLOUCESTER

    Give me the letter, sir.

EDMUND

    I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The
    contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.

GLOUCESTER

    Let's see, let's see.

EDMUND

    I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote
    this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.

GLOUCESTER

    [Reads] 'This policy and reverence of age makes
    the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps
    our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
    them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
    in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not
    as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to
    me, that of this I may speak more. If our father
    would sleep till I waked him, you should half his
    revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your
    brother, EDGAR.'
    Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you
    should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!
    Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain
    to breed it in?--When came this to you? who
    brought it?

EDMUND

    It was not brought me, my lord; there's the
    cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the
    casement of my closet.

GLOUCESTER

    You know the character to be your brother's?

EDMUND

    If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear
    it were his; but, in respect of that, I would
    fain think it were not.

GLOUCESTER

    It is his.

EDMUND

    It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is
    not in the contents.

GLOUCESTER

    Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?

EDMUND

    Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
    maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
    and fathers declining, the father should be as
    ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.

GLOUCESTER

    O villain, villain! His very opinion in the
    letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,
    brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,
    seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!
    Where is he?

EDMUND

    I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please
    you to suspend your indignation against my
    brother till you can derive from him better
    testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
    course; where, if you violently proceed against
    him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
    gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
    heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
    for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
    affection to your honour, and to no further
    pretence of danger.

GLOUCESTER

    Think you so?

EDMUND

    If your honour judge it meet, I will place you
    where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
    auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and
    that without any further delay than this very evening.

GLOUCESTER

    He cannot be such a monster--

EDMUND

    Nor is not, sure.

GLOUCESTER

    To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
    loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him
    out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the
    business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
    myself, to be in a due resolution.

EDMUND

    I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
    business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.

GLOUCESTER

    These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
    no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
    reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
    scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
    friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
    cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
    palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son
    and father. This villain of mine comes under the
    prediction; there's son against father: the king
    falls from bias of nature; there's father against
    child. We have seen the best of our time:
    machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
    ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
    graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall
    lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the
    noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
    offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.

    Exit

EDMUND

    This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,
    when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit
    of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our
    disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
    if we were villains by necessity; fools by
    heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
    treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,
    liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
    planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,
    by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
    of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
    disposition to the charge of a star! My
    father compounded with my mother under the
    dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa
    major; so that it follows, I am rough and
    lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,
    had the maidenliest star in the firmament
    twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--

    Enter EDGAR
    And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
    comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a
    sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do
    portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.

EDGAR

    How now, brother Edmund! what serious
    contemplation are you in?

EDMUND

    I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read
    this other day, what should follow these eclipses.

EDGAR

    Do you busy yourself about that?

EDMUND

    I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed
    unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child
    and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of
    ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
    maledictions against king and nobles; needless
    diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation
    of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.

EDGAR

    How long have you been a sectary astronomical?

EDMUND

    Come, come; when saw you my father last?

EDGAR

    Why, the night gone by.

EDMUND

    Spake you with him?

EDGAR

    Ay, two hours together.

EDMUND

    Parted you in good terms? Found you no
    displeasure in him by word or countenance?

EDGAR

    None at all.

EDMUND

    Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
    him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence
    till some little time hath qualified the heat of
    his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth
    in him, that with the mischief of your person it
    would scarcely allay.

EDGAR

    Some villain hath done me wrong.

EDMUND

    That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent
    forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
    slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my
    lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to
    hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:
    if you do stir abroad, go armed.

EDGAR

    Armed, brother!

EDMUND

    Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I
    am no honest man if there be any good meaning
    towards you: I have told you what I have seen
    and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image
    and horror of it: pray you, away.

EDGAR

    Shall I hear from you anon?

EDMUND

    I do serve you in this business.

    Exit EDGAR
    A credulous father! and a brother noble,
    Whose nature is so far from doing harms,
    That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty
    My practises ride easy! I see the business.
    Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
    All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.

    Exit

SCENE III. The Duke of Albany's palace.

    Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward

GONERIL

    Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?

OSWALD

    Yes, madam.

GONERIL

    By day and night he wrongs me; every hour
    He flashes into one gross crime or other,
    That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:
    His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
    On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
    I will not speak with him; say I am sick:
    If you come slack of former services,
    You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.

OSWALD

    He's coming, madam; I hear him.

    Horns within

GONERIL

    Put on what weary negligence you please,
    You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:
    If he dislike it, let him to our sister,
    Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
    Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,
    That still would manage those authorities
    That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
    Old fools are babes again; and must be used
    With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.
    Remember what I tell you.

OSWALD

    Well, madam.

GONERIL

    And let his knights have colder looks among you;
    What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:
    I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
    That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,
    To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A hall in the same.

    Enter KENT, disguised

KENT

    If but as well I other accents borrow,
    That can my speech defuse, my good intent
    May carry through itself to that full issue
    For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
    If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
    So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,
    Shall find thee full of labours.

    Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and Attendants

KING LEAR

    Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.

    Exit an Attendant
    How now! what art thou?

KENT

    A man, sir.

KING LEAR

    What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?

KENT

    I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve
    him truly that will put me in trust: to love him
    that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,
    and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I
    cannot choose; and to eat no fish.

KING LEAR

    What art thou?

KENT

    A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.

KING LEAR

    If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a
    king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?

KENT

    Service.

KING LEAR

    Who wouldst thou serve?

KENT

    You.

KING LEAR

    Dost thou know me, fellow?

KENT

    No, sir; but you have that in your countenance
    which I would fain call master.

KING LEAR

    What's that?

KENT

    Authority.

KING LEAR

    What services canst thou do?

KENT

    I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious
    tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message
    bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am
    qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.

KING LEAR

    How old art thou?

KENT

    Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor
    so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years
    on my back forty eight.

KING LEAR

    Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no
    worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.
    Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?
    Go you, and call my fool hither.

    Exit an Attendant

    Enter OSWALD
    You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?

OSWALD

    So please you,--

    Exit

KING LEAR

    What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.

    Exit a Knight
    Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.

    Re-enter Knight
    How now! where's that mongrel?

Knight

    He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.

KING LEAR

    Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.

Knight

    Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would
    not.

KING LEAR

    He would not!

Knight

    My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my
    judgment, your highness is not entertained with that
    ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a
    great abatement of kindness appears as well in the
    general dependants as in the duke himself also and
    your daughter.

KING LEAR

    Ha! sayest thou so?

Knight

    I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;
    for my duty cannot be silent when I think your
    highness wronged.

KING LEAR

    Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I
    have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I
    have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity
    than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:
    I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I
    have not seen him this two days.

Knight

    Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the
    fool hath much pined away.

KING LEAR

    No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, and
    tell my daughter I would speak with her.

    Exit an Attendant
    Go you, call hither my fool.

    Exit an Attendant

    Re-enter OSWALD
    O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,
    sir?

OSWALD

    My lady's father.

KING LEAR

    'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: your
    whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!

OSWALD

    I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.

KING LEAR

    Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?

    Striking him

OSWALD

    I'll not be struck, my lord.

KENT

    Nor tripped neither, you base football player.

    Tripping up his heels

KING LEAR

    I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll
    love thee.

KENT

    Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:
    away, away! if you will measure your lubber's
    length again, tarry: but away! go to; have you
    wisdom? so.

    Pushes OSWALD out

KING LEAR

    Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's
    earnest of thy service.

    Giving KENT money

    Enter Fool

Fool

    Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.

    Offering KENT his cap

KING LEAR

    How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?

Fool

    Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.

KENT

    Why, fool?

Fool

    Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:
    nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,
    thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:
    why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,
    and did the third a blessing against his will; if
    thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.
    How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!

KING LEAR

    Why, my boy?

Fool

    If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs
    myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.

KING LEAR

    Take heed, sirrah; the whip.

Fool

    Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped
    out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.

KING LEAR

    A pestilent gall to me!

Fool

    Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.

KING LEAR

    Do.

Fool

    Mark it, nuncle:
    Have more than thou showest,
    Speak less than thou knowest,
    Lend less than thou owest,
    Ride more than thou goest,
    Learn more than thou trowest,
    Set less than thou throwest;
    Leave thy drink and thy whore,
    And keep in-a-door,
    And thou shalt have more
    Than two tens to a score.

KENT

    This is nothing, fool.

Fool

    Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; you
    gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of
    nothing, nuncle?

KING LEAR

    Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.

Fool

    [To KENT] Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of
    his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.

KING LEAR

    A bitter fool!

Fool

    Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a
    bitter fool and a sweet fool?

KING LEAR

    No, lad; teach me.

Fool

    That lord that counsell'd thee
    To give away thy land,
    Come place him here by me,
    Do thou for him stand:
    The sweet and bitter fool
    Will presently appear;
    The one in motley here,
    The other found out there.

KING LEAR

    Dost thou call me fool, boy?

Fool

    All thy other titles thou hast given away; that
    thou wast born with.

KENT

    This is not altogether fool, my lord.

Fool

    No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if
    I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:
    and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool
    to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,
    nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.

KING LEAR

    What two crowns shall they be?

Fool

    Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat
    up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou
    clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away
    both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er
    the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,
    when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak
    like myself in this, let him be whipped that first
    finds it so.

    Singing
    Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;
    For wise men are grown foppish,
    They know not how their wits to wear,
    Their manners are so apish.

KING LEAR

    When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?

Fool

    I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy
    daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them
    the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,

    Singing
    Then they for sudden joy did weep,
    And I for sorrow sung,
    That such a king should play bo-peep,
    And go the fools among.
    Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach
    thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.

KING LEAR

    An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.

Fool

    I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:
    they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt
    have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am
    whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any
    kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be
    thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,
    and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'
    the parings.

    Enter GONERIL

KING LEAR

    How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?
    Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.

Fool

    Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to
    care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a
    figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,
    thou art nothing.

    To GONERIL
    Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face
    bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,
    He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
    Weary of all, shall want some.

    Pointing to KING LEAR
    That's a shealed peascod.

GONERIL

    Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,
    But other of your insolent retinue
    Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
    In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,
    I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
    To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
    By what yourself too late have spoke and done.
    That you protect this course, and put it on
    By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
    Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
    Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
    Might in their working do you that offence,
    Which else were shame, that then necessity
    Will call discreet proceeding.

Fool

    For, you trow, nuncle,
    The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
    That it's had it head bit off by it young.
    So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.

KING LEAR

    Are you our daughter?

GONERIL

    Come, sir,
    I would you would make use of that good wisdom,
    Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
    These dispositions, that of late transform you
    From what you rightly are.

Fool

    May not an ass know when the cart
    draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.

KING LEAR

    Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:
    Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
    Either his notion weakens, his discernings
    Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.
    Who is it that can tell me who I am?

Fool

    Lear's shadow.

KING LEAR

    I would learn that; for, by the
    marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,
    I should be false persuaded I had daughters.

Fool

    Which they will make an obedient father.

KING LEAR

    Your name, fair gentlewoman?

GONERIL

    This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour
    Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
    To understand my purposes aright:
    As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
    Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
    Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
    That this our court, infected with their manners,
    Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
    Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
    Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak
    For instant remedy: be then desired
    By her, that else will take the thing she begs,
    A little to disquantity your train;
    And the remainder, that shall still depend,
    To be such men as may besort your age,
    And know themselves and you.

KING LEAR

    Darkness and devils!
    Saddle my horses; call my train together:
    Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.
    Yet have I left a daughter.

GONERIL

    You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
    Make servants of their betters.

    Enter ALBANY

KING LEAR

    Woe, that too late repents,--

    To ALBANY
    O, sir, are you come?
    Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.
    Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
    More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
    Than the sea-monster!

ALBANY

    Pray, sir, be patient.

KING LEAR

    [To GONERIL] Detested kite! thou liest.
    My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
    That all particulars of duty know,
    And in the most exact regard support
    The worships of their name. O most small fault,
    How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
    That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
    From the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,
    And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
    Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,

    Striking his head
    And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.

ALBANY

    My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
    Of what hath moved you.

KING LEAR

    It may be so, my lord.
    Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!
    Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
    To make this creature fruitful!
    Into her womb convey sterility!
    Dry up in her the organs of increase;
    And from her derogate body never spring
    A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
    Create her child of spleen; that it may live,
    And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!
    Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
    With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
    Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
    To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
    How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
    To have a thankless child! Away, away!

    Exit

ALBANY

    Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?

GONERIL

    Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
    But let his disposition have that scope
    That dotage gives it.

    Re-enter KING LEAR

KING LEAR

    What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
    Within a fortnight!

ALBANY

    What's the matter, sir?

KING LEAR

    I'll tell thee:

    To GONERIL
    Life and death! I am ashamed
    That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
    That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
    Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
    The untented woundings of a father's curse
    Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
    Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
    And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
    To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?
    Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,
    Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
    When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
    She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
    That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
    I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,
    I warrant thee.

    Exeunt KING LEAR, KENT, and Attendants

GONERIL

    Do you mark that, my lord?

ALBANY

    I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
    To the great love I bear you,--

GONERIL

    Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!

    To the Fool
    You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.

Fool

    Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool
    with thee.
    A fox, when one has caught her,
    And such a daughter,
    Should sure to the slaughter,
    If my cap would buy a halter:
    So the fool follows after.

    Exit

GONERIL

    This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!
    'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
    At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,
    Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
    He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
    And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!

ALBANY

    Well, you may fear too far.

GONERIL

    Safer than trust too far:
    Let me still take away the harms I fear,
    Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
    What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister
    If she sustain him and his hundred knights
    When I have show'd the unfitness,--

    Re-enter OSWALD
    How now, Oswald!
    What, have you writ that letter to my sister?

OSWALD

    Yes, madam.

GONERIL

    Take you some company, and away to horse:
    Inform her full of my particular fear;
    And thereto add such reasons of your own
    As may compact it more. Get you gone;
    And hasten your return.

    Exit OSWALD
    No, no, my lord,
    This milky gentleness and course of yours
    Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,
    You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
    Than praised for harmful mildness.

ALBANY

    How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:
    Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.

GONERIL

    Nay, then--

ALBANY

    Well, well; the event.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Court before the same.

    Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool

KING LEAR

    Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
    Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you
    know than comes from her demand out of the letter.
    If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.

KENT

    I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered
    your letter.

    Exit

Fool

    If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in
    danger of kibes?

KING LEAR

    Ay, boy.

Fool

    Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go
    slip-shod.

KING LEAR

    Ha, ha, ha!

Fool

    Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
    for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
    apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.

KING LEAR

    Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?

Fool

    She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
    crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'
    the middle on's face?

KING LEAR

    No.

Fool

    Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that
    what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.

KING LEAR

    I did her wrong--

Fool

    Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?

KING LEAR

    No.

Fool

    Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.

KING LEAR

    Why?

Fool

    Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his
    daughters, and leave his horns without a case.

KING LEAR

    I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
    horses ready?

Fool

    Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
    seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.

KING LEAR

    Because they are not eight?

Fool

    Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.

KING LEAR

    To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!

Fool

    If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten
    for being old before thy time.

KING LEAR

    How's that?

Fool

    Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
    been wise.

KING LEAR

    O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven
    Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!

    Enter Gentleman
    How now! are the horses ready?

Gentleman

    Ready, my lord.

KING LEAR

    Come, boy.

Fool

    She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
    Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. GLOUCESTER's castle.

    Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him

EDMUND

    Save thee, Curan.

CURAN

    And you, sir. I have been with your father, and
    given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
    his duchess will be here with him this night.

EDMUND

    How comes that?

CURAN

    Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;
    I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
    ear-kissing arguments?

EDMUND

    Not I pray you, what are they?

CURAN

    Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the
    Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?

EDMUND

    Not a word.

CURAN

    You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.

    Exit

EDMUND

    The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
    This weaves itself perforce into my business.
    My father hath set guard to take my brother;
    And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
    Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!
    Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!

    Enter EDGAR
    My father watches: O sir, fly this place;
    Intelligence is given where you are hid;
    You have now the good advantage of the night:
    Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
    He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,
    And Regan with him: have you nothing said
    Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
    Advise yourself.

EDGAR

    I am sure on't, not a word.

EDMUND

    I hear my father coming: pardon me:
    In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
    Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.
    Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!
    Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.

    Exit EDGAR
    Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.

    Wounds his arm
    Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards
    Do more than this in sport. Father, father!
    Stop, stop! No help?

    Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches

GLOUCESTER

    Now, Edmund, where's the villain?

EDMUND

    Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
    Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
    To stand auspicious mistress,--

GLOUCESTER

    But where is he?

EDMUND

    Look, sir, I bleed.

GLOUCESTER

    Where is the villain, Edmund?

EDMUND

    Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--

GLOUCESTER

    Pursue him, ho! Go after.

    Exeunt some Servants
    By no means what?

EDMUND

    Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
    But that I told him, the revenging gods
    'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
    Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
    The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
    Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
    To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
    With his prepared sword, he charges home
    My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
    But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
    Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,
    Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
    Full suddenly he fled.

GLOUCESTER

    Let him fly far:
    Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
    And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
    My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
    By his authority I will proclaim it,
    That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
    Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
    He that conceals him, death.

EDMUND

    When I dissuaded him from his intent,
    And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
    I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
    'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
    If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
    Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
    Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--
    As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
    My very character,--I'ld turn it all
    To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
    And thou must make a dullard of the world,
    If they not thought the profits of my death
    Were very pregnant and potential spurs
    To make thee seek it.'

GLOUCESTER

    Strong and fasten'd villain
    Would he deny his letter? I never got him.

    Tucket within
    Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
    All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
    The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
    I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
    May have the due note of him; and of my land,
    Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
    To make thee capable.

    Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants

CORNWALL

    How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,
    Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.

REGAN

    If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
    Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?

GLOUCESTER

    O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!

REGAN

    What, did my father's godson seek your life?
    He whom my father named? your Edgar?

GLOUCESTER

    O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!

REGAN

    Was he not companion with the riotous knights
    That tend upon my father?

GLOUCESTER

    I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.

EDMUND

    Yes, madam, he was of that consort.

REGAN

    No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:
    'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
    To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
    I have this present evening from my sister
    Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,
    That if they come to sojourn at my house,
    I'll not be there.

CORNWALL

    Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
    Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
    A child-like office.

EDMUND

    'Twas my duty, sir.

GLOUCESTER

    He did bewray his practise; and received
    This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.

CORNWALL

    Is he pursued?

GLOUCESTER

    Ay, my good lord.

CORNWALL

    If he be taken, he shall never more
    Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
    How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
    Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
    So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
    Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
    You we first seize on.

EDMUND

    I shall serve you, sir,
    Truly, however else.

GLOUCESTER

    For him I thank your grace.

CORNWALL

    You know not why we came to visit you,--

REGAN

    Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:
    Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
    Wherein we must have use of your advice:
    Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
    Of differences, which I least thought it fit
    To answer from our home; the several messengers
    From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
    Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
    Your needful counsel to our business,
    Which craves the instant use.

GLOUCESTER

    I serve you, madam:
    Your graces are right welcome.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Before Gloucester's castle.

    Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally

OSWALD

    Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?

KENT

    Ay.

OSWALD

    Where may we set our horses?

KENT

    I' the mire.

OSWALD

    Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.

KENT

    I love thee not.

OSWALD

    Why, then, I care not for thee.

KENT

    If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee
    care for me.

OSWALD

    Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.

KENT

    Fellow, I know thee.

OSWALD

    What dost thou know me for?

KENT

    A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
    base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
    hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
    lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
    glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
    one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
    bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
    the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
    and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
    will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
    the least syllable of thy addition.

OSWALD

    Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail
    on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!

KENT

    What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou
    knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
    thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you
    rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon
    shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:
    draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.

    Drawing his sword

OSWALD

    Away! I have nothing to do with thee.

KENT

    Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the
    king; and take vanity the puppet's part against the
    royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so
    carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.

OSWALD

    Help, ho! murder! help!

KENT

    Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat
    slave, strike.

    Beating him

OSWALD

    Help, ho! murder! murder!

    Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants

EDMUND

    How now! What's the matter?

KENT

    With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll
    flesh ye; come on, young master.

GLOUCESTER

    Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?

CORNWALL

    Keep peace, upon your lives:
    He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?

REGAN

    The messengers from our sister and the king.

CORNWALL

    What is your difference? speak.

OSWALD

    I am scarce in breath, my lord.

KENT

    No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You
    cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a
    tailor made thee.

CORNWALL

    Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?

KENT

    Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could
    not have made him so ill, though he had been but two
    hours at the trade.

CORNWALL

    Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?

OSWALD

    This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared
    at suit of his gray beard,--

KENT

    Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My
    lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this
    unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of
    a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?

CORNWALL

    Peace, sirrah!
    You beastly knave, know you no reverence?

KENT

    Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.

CORNWALL

    Why art thou angry?

KENT

    That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
    Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
    Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
    Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
    That in the natures of their lords rebel;
    Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
    Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
    With every gale and vary of their masters,
    Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
    A plague upon your epileptic visage!
    Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
    Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,
    I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.

CORNWALL

    Why, art thou mad, old fellow?

GLOUCESTER

    How fell you out? say that.

KENT

    No contraries hold more antipathy
    Than I and such a knave.

CORNWALL

    Why dost thou call him a knave? What's his offence?

KENT

    His countenance likes me not.

CORNWALL

    No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.

KENT

    Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
    I have seen better faces in my time
    Than stands on any shoulder that I see
    Before me at this instant.

CORNWALL

    This is some fellow,
    Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
    A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
    Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
    An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
    An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
    These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
    Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
    Than twenty silly ducking observants
    That stretch their duties nicely.

KENT

    Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
    Under the allowance of your great aspect,
    Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
    On flickering Phoebus' front,--

CORNWALL

    What mean'st by this?

KENT

    To go out of my dialect, which you
    discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
    flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
    accent was a plain knave; which for my part
    I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
    to entreat me to 't.

CORNWALL

    What was the offence you gave him?

OSWALD

    I never gave him any:
    It pleased the king his master very late
    To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
    When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,
    Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
    And put upon him such a deal of man,
    That worthied him, got praises of the king
    For him attempting who was self-subdued;
    And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
    Drew on me here again.

KENT

    None of these rogues and cowards
    But Ajax is their fool.

CORNWALL

    Fetch forth the stocks!
    You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
    We'll teach you--

KENT

    Sir, I am too old to learn:
    Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
    On whose employment I was sent to you:
    You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
    Against the grace and person of my master,
    Stocking his messenger.

CORNWALL

    Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
    There shall he sit till noon.

REGAN

    Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.

KENT

    Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
    You should not use me so.

REGAN

    Sir, being his knave, I will.

CORNWALL

    This is a fellow of the self-same colour
    Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!

    Stocks brought out

GLOUCESTER

    Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
    His fault is much, and the good king his master
    Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction
    Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
    For pilferings and most common trespasses
    Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,
    That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,
    Should have him thus restrain'd.

CORNWALL

    I'll answer that.

REGAN

    My sister may receive it much more worse,
    To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,
    For following her affairs. Put in his legs.

    KENT is put in the stocks
    Come, my good lord, away.

    Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT

GLOUCESTER

    I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,
    Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
    Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.

KENT

    Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;
    Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
    A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
    Give you good morrow!

GLOUCESTER

    The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.

    Exit

KENT

    Good king, that must approve the common saw,
    Thou out of heaven's benediction comest
    To the warm sun!
    Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
    That by thy comfortable beams I may
    Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles
    But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
    Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
    Of my obscured course; and shall find time
    From this enormous state, seeking to give
    Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,
    Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
    This shameful lodging.
    Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!

    Sleeps

SCENE III. A wood.

    Enter EDGAR

EDGAR

    I heard myself proclaim'd;
    And by the happy hollow of a tree
    Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,
    That guard, and most unusual vigilance,
    Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,
    I will preserve myself: and am bethought
    To take the basest and most poorest shape
    That ever penury, in contempt of man,
    Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
    Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;
    And with presented nakedness out-face
    The winds and persecutions of the sky.
    The country gives me proof and precedent
    Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
    Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
    Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
    And with this horrible object, from low farms,
    Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
    Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
    Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
    That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.

    Exit

SCENE IV. Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks.

    Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman

KING LEAR

    'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
    And not send back my messenger.

Gentleman

    As I learn'd,
    The night before there was no purpose in them
    Of this remove.

KENT

    Hail to thee, noble master!

KING LEAR

    Ha!
    Makest thou this shame thy pastime?

KENT

    No, my lord.

Fool

    Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied
    by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by
    the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's
    over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden
    nether-stocks.

KING LEAR

    What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
    To set thee here?

KENT

    It is both he and she;
    Your son and daughter.

KING LEAR

    No.

KENT

    Yes.

KING LEAR

    No, I say.

KENT

    I say, yea.

KING LEAR

    No, no, they would not.

KENT

    Yes, they have.

KING LEAR

    By Jupiter, I swear, no.

KENT

    By Juno, I swear, ay.

KING LEAR

    They durst not do 't;
    They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,
    To do upon respect such violent outrage:
    Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
    Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,
    Coming from us.

KENT

    My lord, when at their home
    I did commend your highness' letters to them,
    Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
    My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
    Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
    From Goneril his mistress salutations;
    Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
    Which presently they read: on whose contents,
    They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
    Commanded me to follow, and attend
    The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
    And meeting here the other messenger,
    Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--
    Being the very fellow that of late
    Display'd so saucily against your highness,--
    Having more man than wit about me, drew:
    He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
    Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
    The shame which here it suffers.

Fool

    Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.
    Fathers that wear rags
    Do make their children blind;
    But fathers that bear bags
    Shall see their children kind.
    Fortune, that arrant whore,
    Ne'er turns the key to the poor.
    But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours
    for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.

KING LEAR

    O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
    Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
    Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?

KENT

    With the earl, sir, here within.

KING LEAR

    Follow me not;
    Stay here.

    Exit

Gentleman

    Made you no more offence but what you speak of?

KENT

    None.
    How chance the king comes with so small a train?

Fool

    And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that
    question, thou hadst well deserved it.

KENT

    Why, fool?

Fool

    We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee
    there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow
    their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and
    there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
    that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
    runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
    following it: but the great one that goes up the
    hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man
    gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
    would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
    That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
    And follows but for form,
    Will pack when it begins to rain,
    And leave thee in the storm,
    But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
    And let the wise man fly:
    The knave turns fool that runs away;
    The fool no knave, perdy.

KENT

    Where learned you this, fool?

Fool

    Not i' the stocks, fool.

    Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER

KING LEAR

    Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
    They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;
    The images of revolt and flying off.
    Fetch me a better answer.

GLOUCESTER

    My dear lord,
    You know the fiery quality of the duke;
    How unremoveable and fix'd he is
    In his own course.

KING LEAR

    Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
    Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
    I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.

GLOUCESTER

    Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.

KING LEAR

    Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?

GLOUCESTER

    Ay, my good lord.

KING LEAR

    The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
    Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
    Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
    Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--
    No, but not yet: may be he is not well:
    Infirmity doth still neglect all office
    Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
    When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
    To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
    And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
    To take the indisposed and sickly fit
    For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore

    Looking on KENT
    Should he sit here? This act persuades me
    That this remotion of the duke and her
    Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.
    Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,
    Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
    Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
    Till it cry sleep to death.

GLOUCESTER

    I would have all well betwixt you.

    Exit

KING LEAR

    O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!

Fool

    Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels
    when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em
    o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,
    wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure
    kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.

    Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants

KING LEAR

    Good morrow to you both.

CORNWALL

    Hail to your grace!

    KENT is set at liberty

REGAN

    I am glad to see your highness.

KING LEAR

    Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
    I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
    I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
    Sepulchring an adultress.

    To KENT
    O, are you free?
    Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
    Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied
    Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:

    Points to his heart
    I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
    With how depraved a quality--O Regan!

REGAN

    I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.
    You less know how to value her desert
    Than she to scant her duty.

KING LEAR

    Say, how is that?

REGAN

    I cannot think my sister in the least
    Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
    She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
    'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
    As clears her from all blame.

KING LEAR

    My curses on her!

REGAN

    O, sir, you are old.
    Nature in you stands on the very verge
    Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
    By some discretion, that discerns your state
    Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
    That to our sister you do make return;
    Say you have wrong'd her, sir.

KING LEAR

    Ask her forgiveness?
    Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
    'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;

    Kneeling
    Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
    That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'

REGAN

    Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:
    Return you to my sister.

KING LEAR

    [Rising] Never, Regan:
    She hath abated me of half my train;
    Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
    Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:
    All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
    On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
    You taking airs, with lameness!

CORNWALL

    Fie, sir, fie!

KING LEAR

    You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
    Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
    You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
    To fall and blast her pride!

REGAN

    O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,
    When the rash mood is on.

KING LEAR

    No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
    Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
    Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
    Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
    To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
    To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
    And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
    Against my coming in: thou better know'st
    The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
    Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
    Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,
    Wherein I thee endow'd.

REGAN

    Good sir, to the purpose.

KING LEAR

    Who put my man i' the stocks?

    Tucket within

CORNWALL

    What trumpet's that?

REGAN

    I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,
    That she would soon be here.

    Enter OSWALD
    Is your lady come?

KING LEAR

    This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride
    Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
    Out, varlet, from my sight!

CORNWALL

    What means your grace?

KING LEAR

    Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
    Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,

    Enter GONERIL
    If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
    Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
    Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!

    To GONERIL
    Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
    O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?

GONERIL

    Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?
    All's not offence that indiscretion finds
    And dotage terms so.

KING LEAR

    O sides, you are too tough;
    Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?

CORNWALL

    I set him there, sir: but his own disorders
    Deserved much less advancement.

KING LEAR

    You! did you?

REGAN

    I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
    If, till the expiration of your month,
    You will return and sojourn with my sister,
    Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
    I am now from home, and out of that provision
    Which shall be needful for your entertainment.

KING LEAR

    Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
    No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
    To wage against the enmity o' the air;
    To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--
    Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
    Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
    Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
    To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg
    To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
    Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
    To this detested groom.

    Pointing at OSWALD

GONERIL

    At your choice, sir.

KING LEAR

    I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:
    I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
    We'll no more meet, no more see one another:
    But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
    Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
    Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
    A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
    In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
    Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
    I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
    Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
    Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
    I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
    I and my hundred knights.

REGAN

    Not altogether so:
    I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
    For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
    For those that mingle reason with your passion
    Must be content to think you old, and so--
    But she knows what she does.

KING LEAR

    Is this well spoken?

REGAN

    I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
    Is it not well? What should you need of more?
    Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
    Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,
    Should many people, under two commands,
    Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.

GONERIL

    Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
    From those that she calls servants or from mine?

REGAN

    Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,
    We could control them. If you will come to me,--
    For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you
    To bring but five and twenty: to no more
    Will I give place or notice.

KING LEAR

    I gave you all--

REGAN

    And in good time you gave it.

KING LEAR

    Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
    But kept a reservation to be follow'd
    With such a number. What, must I come to you
    With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?

REGAN

    And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.

KING LEAR

    Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
    When others are more wicked: not being the worst
    Stands in some rank of praise.

    To GONERIL
    I'll go with thee:
    Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,
    And thou art twice her love.

GONERIL

    Hear me, my lord;
    What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
    To follow in a house where twice so many
    Have a command to tend you?

REGAN

    What need one?

KING LEAR

    O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
    Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
    Allow not nature more than nature needs,
    Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
    If only to go warm were gorgeous,
    Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
    Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--
    You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
    You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
    As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
    If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
    Against their father, fool me not so much
    To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
    And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
    Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
    I will have such revenges on you both,
    That all the world shall--I will do such things,--
    What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be
    The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep
    No, I'll not weep:
    I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
    Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,
    Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!

    Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool

    Storm and tempest

CORNWALL

    Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.

REGAN

    This house is little: the old man and his people
    Cannot be well bestow'd.

GONERIL

    'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,
    And must needs taste his folly.

REGAN

    For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
    But not one follower.

GONERIL

    So am I purposed.
    Where is my lord of Gloucester?

CORNWALL

    Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.

    Re-enter GLOUCESTER

GLOUCESTER

    The king is in high rage.

CORNWALL

    Whither is he going?

GLOUCESTER

    He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.

CORNWALL

    'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.

GONERIL

    My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.

GLOUCESTER

    Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
    Do sorely ruffle; for many miles a bout
    There's scarce a bush.

REGAN

    O, sir, to wilful men,
    The injuries that they themselves procure
    Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
    He is attended with a desperate train;
    And what they may incense him to, being apt
    To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.

CORNWALL

    Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:
    My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A heath.

    Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting

KENT

    Who's there, besides foul weather?

Gentleman

    One minded like the weather, most unquietly.

KENT

    I know you. Where's the king?

Gentleman

    Contending with the fretful element:
    Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,
    Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,
    That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
    Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
    Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
    Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
    The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
    This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
    The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
    Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
    And bids what will take all.

KENT

    But who is with him?

Gentleman

    None but the fool; who labours to out-jest
    His heart-struck injuries.

KENT

    Sir, I do know you;
    And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
    Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
    Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
    With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
    Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
    Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
    Which are to France the spies and speculations
    Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
    Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
    Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
    Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
    Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
    But, true it is, from France there comes a power
    Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
    Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
    In some of our best ports, and are at point
    To show their open banner. Now to you:
    If on my credit you dare build so far
    To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
    Some that will thank you, making just report
    Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
    The king hath cause to plain.
    I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
    And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer
    This office to you.

Gentleman

    I will talk further with you.

KENT

    No, do not.
    For confirmation that I am much more
    Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
    What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--
    As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;
    And she will tell you who your fellow is
    That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
    I will go seek the king.

Gentleman

    Give me your hand: have you no more to say?

KENT

    Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;
    That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain
    That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him
    Holla the other.

    Exeunt severally

SCENE II. Another part of the heath. Storm still.

    Enter KING LEAR and Fool

KING LEAR

    Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
    You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
    Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
    You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
    Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
    Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
    Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
    Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,
    That make ingrateful man!

Fool

    O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry
    house is better than this rain-water out o' door.
    Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters' blessing:
    here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.

KING LEAR

    Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
    Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:
    I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;
    I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
    You owe me no subscription: then let fall
    Your horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave,
    A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:
    But yet I call you servile ministers,
    That have with two pernicious daughters join'd
    Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head
    So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!

Fool

    He that has a house to put's head in has a good
    head-piece.
    The cod-piece that will house
    Before the head has any,
    The head and he shall louse;
    So beggars marry many.
    The man that makes his toe
    What he his heart should make
    Shall of a corn cry woe,
    And turn his sleep to wake.
    For there was never yet fair woman but she made
    mouths in a glass.

KING LEAR

    No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
    I will say nothing.

    Enter KENT

KENT

    Who's there?

Fool

    Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a wise
    man and a fool.

KENT

    Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night
    Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
    Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
    And make them keep their caves: since I was man,
    Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
    Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
    Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry
    The affliction nor the fear.

KING LEAR

    Let the great gods,
    That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,
    Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
    That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
    Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;
    Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue
    That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,
    That under covert and convenient seeming
    Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,
    Rive your concealing continents, and cry
    These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
    More sinn'd against than sinning.

KENT

    Alack, bare-headed!
    Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
    Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:
    Repose you there; while I to this hard house--
    More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;
    Which even but now, demanding after you,
    Denied me to come in--return, and force
    Their scanted courtesy.

KING LEAR

    My wits begin to turn.
    Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?
    I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
    The art of our necessities is strange,
    That can make vile things precious. Come,
    your hovel.
    Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
    That's sorry yet for thee.

Fool

    [Singing]
    He that has and a little tiny wit--
    With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,--
    Must make content with his fortunes fit,
    For the rain it raineth every day.

KING LEAR

    True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.

    Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT

Fool

    This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.
    I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:
    When priests are more in word than matter;
    When brewers mar their malt with water;
    When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
    No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
    When every case in law is right;
    No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
    When slanders do not live in tongues;
    Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
    When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
    And bawds and whores do churches build;
    Then shall the realm of Albion
    Come to great confusion:
    Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
    That going shall be used with feet.
    This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

    Exit

SCENE III. Gloucester's castle.

    Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND

GLOUCESTER

    Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural
    dealing. When I desire their leave that I might
    pity him, they took from me the use of mine own
    house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual
    displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for
    him, nor any way sustain him.

EDMUND

    Most savage and unnatural!

GLOUCESTER

    Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt
    the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have
    received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be
    spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:
    these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
    home; there's part of a power already footed: we
    must incline to the king. I will seek him, and
    privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with
    the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:
    if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.
    Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,
    the king my old master must be relieved. There is
    some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.

    Exit

EDMUND

    This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
    Instantly know; and of that letter too:
    This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
    That which my father loses; no less than all:
    The younger rises when the old doth fall.

    Exit

SCENE IV. The heath. Before a hovel.

    Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool

KENT

    Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:
    The tyranny of the open night's too rough
    For nature to endure.

    Storm still

KING LEAR

    Let me alone.

KENT

    Good my lord, enter here.

KING LEAR

    Wilt break my heart?

KENT

    I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.

KING LEAR

    Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
    Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;
    But where the greater malady is fix'd,
    The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;
    But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
    Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the
    mind's free,
    The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
    Doth from my senses take all feeling else
    Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
    Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
    For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:
    No, I will weep no more. In such a night
    To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
    In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
    Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--
    O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
    No more of that.

KENT

    Good my lord, enter here.

KING LEAR

    Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease:
    This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
    On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.

    To the Fool
    In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,--
    Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.

    Fool goes in
    Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,
    That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
    How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
    Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
    From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
    Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
    Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
    That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
    And show the heavens more just.

EDGAR

    [Within] Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!

    The Fool runs out from the hovel

Fool

    Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit
    Help me, help me!

KENT

    Give me thy hand. Who's there?

Fool

    A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.

KENT

    What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
    Come forth.

    Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man

EDGAR

    Away! the foul fiend follows me!
    Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
    Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.

KING LEAR

    Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
    And art thou come to this?

EDGAR

    Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul
    fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and
    through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;
    that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters
    in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film
    proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over
    four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a
    traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, do
    de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,
    star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
    charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I
    have him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.

    Storm still

KING LEAR

    What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
    Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?

Fool

    Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.

KING LEAR

    Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air
    Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!

KENT

    He hath no daughters, sir.

KING LEAR

    Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature
    To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
    Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers
    Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
    Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
    Those pelican daughters.

EDGAR

    Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:
    Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!

Fool

    This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.

EDGAR

    Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;
    keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with
    man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud
    array. Tom's a-cold.

KING LEAR

    What hast thou been?

EDGAR

    A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled
    my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of
    my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with
    her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and
    broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that
    slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:
    wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman
    out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of
    ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,
    wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
    Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of
    silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot
    out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen
    from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.
    Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:
    Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.
    Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.

    Storm still

KING LEAR

    Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer
    with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.
    Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou
    owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep
    no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on
    's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:
    unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,
    forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!
    come unbutton here.

    Tearing off his clothes

Fool

    Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night
    to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were
    like an old lecher's heart; a small spark, all the
    rest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.

    Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch

EDGAR

    This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins
    at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives
    the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the
    hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the
    poor creature of earth.
    S. Withold footed thrice the old;
    He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;
    Bid her alight,
    And her troth plight,
    And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!

KENT

    How fares your grace?

KING LEAR

    What's he?

KENT

    Who's there? What is't you seek?

GLOUCESTER

    What are you there? Your names?

EDGAR

    Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,
    the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in
    the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,
    eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and
    the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the
    standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to
    tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; who
    hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his
    body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;
    But mice and rats, and such small deer,
    Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
    Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!

GLOUCESTER

    What, hath your grace no better company?

EDGAR

    The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
    Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.

GLOUCESTER

    Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
    That it doth hate what gets it.

EDGAR

    Poor Tom's a-cold.

GLOUCESTER

    Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
    To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:
    Though their injunction be to bar my doors,
    And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
    Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,
    And bring you where both fire and food is ready.

KING LEAR

    First let me talk with this philosopher.
    What is the cause of thunder?

KENT

    Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.

KING LEAR

    I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
    What is your study?

EDGAR

    How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.

KING LEAR

    Let me ask you one word in private.

KENT

    Importune him once more to go, my lord;
    His wits begin to unsettle.

GLOUCESTER

    Canst thou blame him?

    Storm still
    His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent!
    He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!
    Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,
    I am almost mad myself: I had a son,
    Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,
    But lately, very late: I loved him, friend;
    No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,
    The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!
    I do beseech your grace,--

KING LEAR

    O, cry your mercy, sir.
    Noble philosopher, your company.

EDGAR

    Tom's a-cold.

GLOUCESTER

    In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.

KING LEAR

    Come let's in all.

KENT

    This way, my lord.

KING LEAR

    With him;
    I will keep still with my philosopher.

KENT

    Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.

GLOUCESTER

    Take him you on.

KENT

    Sirrah, come on; go along with us.

KING LEAR

    Come, good Athenian.

GLOUCESTER

    No words, no words: hush.

EDGAR

    Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
    His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,
    I smell the blood of a British man.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.

    Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND

CORNWALL

    I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.

EDMUND

    How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus
    gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think
    of.

CORNWALL

    I now perceive, it was not altogether your
    brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;
    but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable
    badness in himself.

EDMUND

    How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to
    be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which
    approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
    of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,
    or not I the detector!

CORNWALL

    o with me to the duchess.

EDMUND

    If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
    mighty business in hand.

CORNWALL

    True or false, it hath made thee earl of
    Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he
    may be ready for our apprehension.

EDMUND

    [Aside] If I find him comforting the king, it will
    stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in
    my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore
    between that and my blood.

CORNWALL

    I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a
    dearer father in my love.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. A chamber in a farmhouse adjoining the castle.

    Enter GLOUCESTER, KING LEAR, KENT, Fool, and EDGAR

GLOUCESTER

    Here is better than the open air; take it
    thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what
    addition I can: I will not be long from you.

KENT

    All the power of his wits have given way to his
    impatience: the gods reward your kindness!

    Exit GLOUCESTER

EDGAR

    Frateretto calls me; and tells me
    Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.
    Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.

Fool

    Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a
    gentleman or a yeoman?

KING LEAR

    A king, a king!

Fool

    No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son;
    for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman
    before him.

KING LEAR

    To have a thousand with red burning spits
    Come hissing in upon 'em,--

EDGAR

    The foul fiend bites my back.

Fool

    He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a
    horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.

KING LEAR

    It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.

    To EDGAR
    Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;

    To the Fool
    Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes!

EDGAR

    Look, where he stands and glares!
    Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?
    Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--

Fool

    Her boat hath a leak,
    And she must not speak
    Why she dares not come over to thee.

EDGAR

    The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
    nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two
    white herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no
    food for thee.

KENT

    How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed:
    Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?

KING LEAR

    I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.

    To EDGAR
    Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;

    To the Fool
    And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,
    Bench by his side:

    To KENT
    you are o' the commission,
    Sit you too.

EDGAR

    Let us deal justly.
    Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
    Thy sheep be in the corn;
    And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,
    Thy sheep shall take no harm.
    Pur! the cat is gray.

KING LEAR

    Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my
    oath before this honourable assembly, she kicked the
    poor king her father.

Fool

    Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?

KING LEAR

    She cannot deny it.

Fool

    Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.

KING LEAR

    And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim
    What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
    Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!
    False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?

EDGAR

    Bless thy five wits!

KENT

    O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,
    That thou so oft have boasted to retain?

EDGAR

    [Aside] My tears begin to take his part so much,
    They'll mar my counterfeiting.

KING LEAR

    The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and
    Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.

EDGAR

    Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
    Be thy mouth or black or white,
    Tooth that poisons if it bite;
    Mastiff, grey-hound, mongrel grim,
    Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
    Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,
    Tom will make them weep and wail:
    For, with throwing thus my head,
    Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
    Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and
    fairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.

KING LEAR

    Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds
    about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that
    makes these hard hearts?

    To EDGAR
    You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred; only I
    do not like the fashion of your garments: you will
    say they are Persian attire: but let them be changed.

KENT

    Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.

KING LEAR

    Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains:
    so, so, so. We'll go to supper i' he morning. So, so, so.

Fool

    And I'll go to bed at noon.

    Re-enter GLOUCESTER

GLOUCESTER

    Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?

KENT

    Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.

GLOUCESTER

    Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;
    I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:
    There is a litter ready; lay him in 't,
    And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
    Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:
    If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
    With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
    Stand in assured loss: take up, take up;
    And follow me, that will to some provision
    Give thee quick conduct.

KENT

    Oppressed nature sleeps:
    This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
    Which, if convenience will not allow,
    Stand in hard cure.

    To the Fool
    Come, help to bear thy master;
    Thou must not stay behind.

GLOUCESTER

    Come, come, away.

    Exeunt all but EDGAR

EDGAR

    When we our betters see bearing our woes,
    We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
    Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
    Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
    But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip,
    When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
    How light and portable my pain seems now,
    When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
    He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
    Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
    When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
    In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.
    What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!
    Lurk, lurk.

    Exit

SCENE VII. Gloucester's castle.

    Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, and Servants

CORNWALL

    Post speedily to my lord your husband; show him
    this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek
    out the villain Gloucester.

    Exeunt some of the Servants

REGAN

    Hang him instantly.

GONERIL

    Pluck out his eyes.

CORNWALL

    Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our
    sister company: the revenges we are bound to take
    upon your traitorous father are not fit for your
    beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to
    a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
    like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent
    betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, my
    lord of Gloucester.

    Enter OSWALD
    How now! where's the king?

OSWALD

    My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
    Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
    Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
    Who, with some other of the lords dependants,
    Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boast
    To have well-armed friends.

CORNWALL

    Get horses for your mistress.

GONERIL

    Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.

CORNWALL

    Edmund, farewell.

    Exeunt GONERIL, EDMUND, and OSWALD
    Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
    Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.

    Exeunt other Servants
    Though well we may not pass upon his life
    Without the form of justice, yet our power
    Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
    May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?

    Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three

REGAN

    Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.

CORNWALL

    Bind fast his corky arms.

GLOUCESTER

    What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider
    You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.

CORNWALL

    Bind him, I say.

    Servants bind him

REGAN

    Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!

GLOUCESTER

    Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.

CORNWALL

    To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--

    REGAN plucks his beard

GLOUCESTER

    By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
    To pluck me by the beard.

REGAN

    So white, and such a traitor!

GLOUCESTER

    Naughty lady,
    These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,
    Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:
    With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
    You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?

CORNWALL

    Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?

REGAN

    Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.

CORNWALL

    And what confederacy have you with the traitors
    Late footed in the kingdom?

REGAN

    To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.

GLOUCESTER

    I have a letter guessingly set down,
    Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
    And not from one opposed.

CORNWALL

    Cunning.

REGAN

    And false.

CORNWALL

    Where hast thou sent the king?

GLOUCESTER

    To Dover.

REGAN

    Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--

CORNWALL

    Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.

GLOUCESTER

    I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.

REGAN

    Wherefore to Dover, sir?

GLOUCESTER

    Because I would not see thy cruel nails
    Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
    In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
    The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
    In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,
    And quench'd the stelled fires:
    Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
    If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
    Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'
    All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see
    The winged vengeance overtake such children.

CORNWALL

    See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
    Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.

GLOUCESTER

    He that will think to live till he be old,
    Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!

REGAN

    One side will mock another; the other too.

CORNWALL

    If you see vengeance,--

First Servant

    Hold your hand, my lord:
    I have served you ever since I was a child;
    But better service have I never done you
    Than now to bid you hold.

REGAN

    How now, you dog!

First Servant

    If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
    I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?

CORNWALL

    My villain!

    They draw and fight

First Servant

    Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.

REGAN

    Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!

    Takes a sword, and runs at him behind

First Servant

    O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
    To see some mischief on him. O!

    Dies

CORNWALL

    Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
    Where is thy lustre now?

GLOUCESTER

    All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?
    Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,
    To quit this horrid act.

REGAN

    Out, treacherous villain!
    Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
    That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
    Who is too good to pity thee.

GLOUCESTER

    O my follies! then Edgar was abused.
    Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!

REGAN

    Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
    His way to Dover.

    Exit one with GLOUCESTER
    How is't, my lord? how look you?

CORNWALL

    I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
    Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
    Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:
    Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.

    Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN

Second Servant

    I'll never care what wickedness I do,
    If this man come to good.

Third Servant

    If she live long,
    And in the end meet the old course of death,
    Women will all turn monsters.

Second Servant

    Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam
    To lead him where he would: his roguish madness
    Allows itself to any thing.

Third Servant

    Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
    To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!

    Exeunt severally

ACT IV
SCENE I. The heath.

    Enter EDGAR

EDGAR

    Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
    Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
    The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
    Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:
    The lamentable change is from the best;
    The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
    Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
    The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
    Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?

    Enter GLOUCESTER, led by an Old Man
    My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
    But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
    Lie would not yield to age.

Old Man

    O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and
    your father's tenant, these fourscore years.

GLOUCESTER

    Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:
    Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
    Thee they may hurt.

Old Man

    Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.

GLOUCESTER

    I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
    I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,
    Our means secure us, and our mere defects
    Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,
    The food of thy abused father's wrath!
    Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
    I'ld say I had eyes again!

Old Man

    How now! Who's there?

EDGAR

    [Aside] O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at
    the worst'?
    I am worse than e'er I was.

Old Man

    'Tis poor mad Tom.

EDGAR

    [Aside] And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
    So long as we can say 'This is the worst.'

Old Man

    Fellow, where goest?

GLOUCESTER

    Is it a beggar-man?

Old Man

    Madman and beggar too.

GLOUCESTER

    He has some reason, else he could not beg.
    I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;
    Which made me think a man a worm: my son
    Came then into my mind; and yet my mind
    Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard
    more since.
    As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.
    They kill us for their sport.

EDGAR

    [Aside] How should this be?
    Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
    Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!

GLOUCESTER

    Is that the naked fellow?

Old Man

    Ay, my lord.

GLOUCESTER

    Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,
    Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,
    I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
    And bring some covering for this naked soul,
    Who I'll entreat to lead me.

Old Man

    Alack, sir, he is mad.

GLOUCESTER

    'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.
    Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;
    Above the rest, be gone.

Old Man

    I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
    Come on't what will.

    Exit

GLOUCESTER

    Sirrah, naked fellow,--

EDGAR

    Poor Tom's a-cold.

    Aside
    I cannot daub it further.

GLOUCESTER

    Come hither, fellow.

EDGAR

    [Aside] And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.

GLOUCESTER

    Know'st thou the way to Dover?

EDGAR

    Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor
    Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
    thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five
    fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as
    Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
    stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of
    mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids
    and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!

GLOUCESTER

    Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
    Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
    Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!
    Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
    That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
    Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;
    So distribution should undo excess,
    And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?

EDGAR

    Ay, master.

GLOUCESTER

    There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
    Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
    Bring me but to the very brim of it,
    And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
    With something rich about me: from that place
    I shall no leading need.

EDGAR

    Give me thy arm:
    Poor Tom shall lead thee.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Before ALBANY's palace.

    Enter GONERIL and EDMUND

GONERIL

    Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
    Not met us on the way.

    Enter OSWALD
    Now, where's your master'?

OSWALD

    Madam, within; but never man so changed.
    I told him of the army that was landed;
    He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:
    His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
    And of the loyal service of his son,
    When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
    And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
    What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
    What like, offensive.

GONERIL

    [To EDMUND] Then shall you go no further.
    It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
    That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
    Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
    May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
    Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
    I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
    Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
    Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,
    If you dare venture in your own behalf,
    A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;

    Giving a favour
    Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
    Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:
    Conceive, and fare thee well.

EDMUND

    Yours in the ranks of death.

GONERIL

    My most dear Gloucester!

    Exit EDMUND
    O, the difference of man and man!
    To thee a woman's services are due:
    My fool usurps my body.

OSWALD

    Madam, here comes my lord.

    Exit

    Enter ALBANY

GONERIL

    I have been worth the whistle.

ALBANY

    O Goneril!
    You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
    Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
    That nature, which contemns its origin,
    Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
    She that herself will sliver and disbranch
    From her material sap, perforce must wither
    And come to deadly use.

GONERIL

    No more; the text is foolish.

ALBANY

    Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
    Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
    Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
    A father, and a gracious aged man,
    Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
    Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
    Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
    A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
    If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
    Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
    It will come,
    Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
    Like monsters of the deep.

GONERIL

    Milk-liver'd man!
    That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
    Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
    Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
    Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
    Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
    France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;
    With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;
    Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
    'Alack, why does he so?'

ALBANY

    See thyself, devil!
    Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
    So horrid as in woman.

GONERIL

    O vain fool!

ALBANY

    Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
    Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness
    To let these hands obey my blood,
    They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
    Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,
    A woman's shape doth shield thee.

GONERIL

    Marry, your manhood now--

    Enter a Messenger

ALBANY

    What news?

Messenger

    O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:
    Slain by his servant, going to put out
    The other eye of Gloucester.

ALBANY

    Gloucester's eye!

Messenger

    A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
    Opposed against the act, bending his sword
    To his great master; who, thereat enraged,
    Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
    But not without that harmful stroke, which since
    Hath pluck'd him after.

ALBANY

    This shows you are above,
    You justicers, that these our nether crimes
    So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!
    Lost he his other eye?

Messenger

    Both, both, my lord.
    This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
    'Tis from your sister.

GONERIL

    [Aside] One way I like this well;
    But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
    May all the building in my fancy pluck
    Upon my hateful life: another way,
    The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.

    Exit

ALBANY

    Where was his son when they did take his eyes?

Messenger

    Come with my lady hither.

ALBANY

    He is not here.

Messenger

    No, my good lord; I met him back again.

ALBANY

    Knows he the wickedness?

Messenger

    Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;
    And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
    Might have the freer course.

ALBANY

    Gloucester, I live
    To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
    And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:
    Tell me what more thou know'st.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The French camp near Dover.

    Enter KENT and a Gentleman

KENT

    Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
    know you the reason?

Gentleman

    Something he left imperfect in the
    state, which since his coming forth is thought
    of; which imports to the kingdom so much
    fear and danger, that his personal return was
    most required and necessary.

KENT

    Who hath he left behind him general?

Gentleman

    The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.

KENT

    Did your letters pierce the queen to any
    demonstration of grief?

Gentleman

    Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
    And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
    Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
    Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
    Sought to be king o'er her.

KENT

    O, then it moved her.

Gentleman

    Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
    Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
    Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
    Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
    That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
    What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
    As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
    Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
    If all could so become it.

KENT

    Made she no verbal question?

Gentleman

    'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
    Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
    Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
    Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
    Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
    The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
    And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
    To deal with grief alone.

KENT

    It is the stars,
    The stars above us, govern our conditions;
    Else one self mate and mate could not beget
    Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?

Gentleman

    No.

KENT

    Was this before the king return'd?

Gentleman

    No, since.

KENT

    Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
    Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
    What we are come about, and by no means
    Will yield to see his daughter.

Gentleman

    Why, good sir?

KENT

    A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
    That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
    To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
    To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
    His mind so venomously, that burning shame
    Detains him from Cordelia.

Gentleman

    Alack, poor gentleman!

KENT

    Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?

Gentleman

    'Tis so, they are afoot.

KENT

    Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
    And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
    Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
    When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
    Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
    Along with me.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. A tent.

    Enter, with drum and colours, CORDELIA, Doctor, and Soldiers

CORDELIA

    Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
    As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
    Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
    With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
    Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
    In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
    Search every acre in the high-grown field,
    And bring him to our eye.

    Exit an Officer
    What can man's wisdom
    In the restoring his bereaved sense?
    He that helps him take all my outward worth.

Doctor

    There is means, madam:
    Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
    The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,
    Are many simples operative, whose power
    Will close the eye of anguish.

CORDELIA

    All blest secrets,
    All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
    Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
    In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;
    Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
    That wants the means to lead it.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    News, madam;
    The British powers are marching hitherward.

CORDELIA

    'Tis known before; our preparation stands
    In expectation of them. O dear father,
    It is thy business that I go about;
    Therefore great France
    My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
    No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
    But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:
    Soon may I hear and see him!

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Gloucester's castle.

    Enter REGAN and OSWALD

REGAN

    But are my brother's powers set forth?

OSWALD

    Ay, madam.

REGAN

    Himself in person there?

OSWALD

    Madam, with much ado:
    Your sister is the better soldier.

REGAN

    Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?

OSWALD

    No, madam.

REGAN

    What might import my sister's letter to him?

OSWALD

    I know not, lady.

REGAN

    'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
    It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
    To let him live: where he arrives he moves
    All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,
    In pity of his misery, to dispatch
    His nighted life: moreover, to descry
    The strength o' the enemy.

OSWALD

    I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.

REGAN

    Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;
    The ways are dangerous.

OSWALD

    I may not, madam:
    My lady charged my duty in this business.

REGAN

    Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
    Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
    Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,
    Let me unseal the letter.

OSWALD

    Madam, I had rather--

REGAN

    I know your lady does not love her husband;
    I am sure of that: and at her late being here
    She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
    To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.

OSWALD

    I, madam?

REGAN

    I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:
    Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
    My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;
    And more convenient is he for my hand
    Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
    If you do find him, pray you, give him this;
    And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
    I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.
    So, fare you well.
    If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
    Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.

OSWALD

    Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
    What party I do follow.

REGAN

    Fare thee well.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Fields near Dover.

    Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant

GLOUCESTER

    When shall we come to the top of that same hill?

EDGAR

    You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.

GLOUCESTER

    Methinks the ground is even.

EDGAR

    Horrible steep.
    Hark, do you hear the sea?

GLOUCESTER

    No, truly.

EDGAR

    Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
    By your eyes' anguish.

GLOUCESTER

    So may it be, indeed:
    Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st
    In better phrase and matter than thou didst.

EDGAR

    You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
    But in my garments.

GLOUCESTER

    Methinks you're better spoken.

EDGAR

    Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful
    And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
    The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
    Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
    Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
    Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
    The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,
    Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
    Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
    Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
    That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
    Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;
    Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
    Topple down headlong.

GLOUCESTER

    Set me where you stand.

EDGAR

    Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
    Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
    Would I not leap upright.

GLOUCESTER

    Let go my hand.
    Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
    Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
    Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;
    Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.

EDGAR

    Now fare you well, good sir.

GLOUCESTER

    With all my heart.

EDGAR

    Why I do trifle thus with his despair
    Is done to cure it.

GLOUCESTER

    [Kneeling] O you mighty gods!
    This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
    Shake patiently my great affliction off:
    If I could bear it longer, and not fall
    To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
    My snuff and loathed part of nature should
    Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
    Now, fellow, fare thee well.

    He falls forward

EDGAR

    Gone, sir: farewell.
    And yet I know not how conceit may rob
    The treasury of life, when life itself
    Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
    By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
    Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!
    Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
    What are you, sir?

GLOUCESTER

    Away, and let me die.

EDGAR

    Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
    So many fathom down precipitating,
    Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
    Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
    Ten masts at each make not the altitude
    Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
    Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.

GLOUCESTER

    But have I fall'n, or no?

EDGAR

    From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
    Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
    Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.

GLOUCESTER

    Alack, I have no eyes.
    Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
    To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
    When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
    And frustrate his proud will.

EDGAR

    Give me your arm:
    Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.

GLOUCESTER

    Too well, too well.

EDGAR

    This is above all strangeness.
    Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
    Which parted from you?

GLOUCESTER

    A poor unfortunate beggar.

EDGAR

    As I stood here below, methought his eyes
    Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
    Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
    It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
    Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
    Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.

GLOUCESTER

    I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
    Affliction till it do cry out itself
    'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
    I took it for a man; often 'twould say
    'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.

EDGAR

    Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?

    Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers
    The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
    His master thus.

KING LEAR

    No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the
    king himself.

EDGAR

    O thou side-piercing sight!

KING LEAR

    Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
    press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
    crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,
    look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted
    cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove
    it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well
    flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!
    Give the word.

EDGAR

    Sweet marjoram.

KING LEAR

    Pass.

GLOUCESTER

    I know that voice.

KING LEAR

    Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered
    me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my
    beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
    and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
    too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
    wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when
    the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
    found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are
    not men o' their words: they told me I was every
    thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.

GLOUCESTER

    The trick of that voice I do well remember:
    Is 't not the king?

KING LEAR

    Ay, every inch a king:
    When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
    I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
    Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
    The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
    Does lecher in my sight.
    Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
    Was kinder to his father than my daughters
    Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
    To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
    Behold yond simpering dame,
    Whose face between her forks presages snow;
    That minces virtue, and does shake the head
    To hear of pleasure's name;
    The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
    With a more riotous appetite.
    Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
    Though women all above:
    But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
    Beneath is all the fiends';
    There's hell, there's darkness, there's the
    sulphurous pit,
    Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,
    fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,
    good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:
    there's money for thee.

GLOUCESTER

    O, let me kiss that hand!

KING LEAR

    Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.

GLOUCESTER

    O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
    Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?

KING LEAR

    I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny
    at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not
    love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the
    penning of it.

GLOUCESTER

    Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.

EDGAR

    I would not take this from report; it is,
    And my heart breaks at it.

KING LEAR

    Read.

GLOUCESTER

    What, with the case of eyes?

KING LEAR

    O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your
    head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in
    a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how
    this world goes.

GLOUCESTER

    I see it feelingly.

KING LEAR

    What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes
    with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
    justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
    thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which
    is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen
    a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?

GLOUCESTER

    Ay, sir.

KING LEAR

    And the creature run from the cur? There thou
    mightst behold the great image of authority: a
    dog's obeyed in office.
    Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
    Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
    Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
    For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
    Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
    Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
    And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:
    Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
    None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:
    Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
    To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
    And like a scurvy politician, seem
    To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:
    Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.

EDGAR

    O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!

KING LEAR

    If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
    I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
    Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
    Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,
    We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.

GLOUCESTER

    Alack, alack the day!

KING LEAR

    When we are born, we cry that we are come
    To this great stage of fools: this a good block;
    It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
    A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;
    And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
    Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!

    Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants

Gentleman

    O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,
    Your most dear daughter--

KING LEAR

    No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
    The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
    You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
    I am cut to the brains.

Gentleman

    You shall have any thing.

KING LEAR

    No seconds? all myself?
    Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
    To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
    Ay, and laying autumn's dust.

Gentleman

    Good sir,--

KING LEAR

    I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!
    I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,
    My masters, know you that.

Gentleman

    You are a royal one, and we obey you.

KING LEAR

    Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you
    shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.

    Exit running; Attendants follow

Gentleman

    A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
    Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,
    Who redeems nature from the general curse
    Which twain have brought her to.

EDGAR

    Hail, gentle sir.

Gentleman

    Sir, speed you: what's your will?

EDGAR

    Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?

Gentleman

    Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,
    Which can distinguish sound.

EDGAR

    But, by your favour,
    How near's the other army?

Gentleman

    Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
    Stands on the hourly thought.

EDGAR

    I thank you, sir: that's all.

Gentleman

    Though that the queen on special cause is here,
    Her army is moved on.

EDGAR

    I thank you, sir.

    Exit Gentleman

GLOUCESTER

    You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:
    Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
    To die before you please!

EDGAR

    Well pray you, father.

GLOUCESTER

    Now, good sir, what are you?

EDGAR

    A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;
    Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
    Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
    I'll lead you to some biding.

GLOUCESTER

    Hearty thanks:
    The bounty and the benison of heaven
    To boot, and boot!

    Enter OSWALD

OSWALD

    A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
    That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh
    To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,
    Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out
    That must destroy thee.

GLOUCESTER

    Now let thy friendly hand
    Put strength enough to't.

    EDGAR interposes

OSWALD

    Wherefore, bold peasant,
    Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;
    Lest that the infection of his fortune take
    Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.

EDGAR

    Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.

OSWALD

    Let go, slave, or thou diest!

EDGAR

    Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk
    pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,
    'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.
    Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor
    ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be
    the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.

OSWALD

    Out, dunghill!

EDGAR

    Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter vor
    your foins.

    They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down

OSWALD

    Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:
    If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;
    And give the letters which thou find'st about me
    To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out
    Upon the British party: O, untimely death!

    Dies

EDGAR

    I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
    As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
    As badness would desire.

GLOUCESTER

    What, is he dead?

EDGAR

    Sit you down, father; rest you
    Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of
    May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry
    He had no other death's-man. Let us see:
    Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:
    To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
    Their papers, is more lawful.

    Reads
    'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have
    many opportunities to cut him off: if your will
    want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.
    There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror:
    then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal; from
    the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply
    the place for your labour.
    'Your--wife, so I would say--
    'Affectionate servant,
    'GONERIL.'
    O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!
    A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
    And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,
    Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
    Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
    With this ungracious paper strike the sight
    Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well
    That of thy death and business I can tell.

GLOUCESTER

    The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
    That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
    Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:
    So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
    And woes by wrong imaginations lose
    The knowledge of themselves.

EDGAR

    Give me your hand:

    Drum afar off
    Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:
    Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep,

    soft music playing; Gentleman, and others attending.

    Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor

CORDELIA

    O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
    To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
    And every measure fail me.

KENT

    To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
    All my reports go with the modest truth;
    Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.

CORDELIA

    Be better suited:
    These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
    I prithee, put them off.

KENT

    Pardon me, dear madam;
    Yet to be known shortens my made intent:
    My boon I make it, that you know me not
    Till time and I think meet.

CORDELIA

    Then be't so, my good lord.

    To the Doctor
    How does the king?

Doctor

    Madam, sleeps still.

CORDELIA

    O you kind gods,
    Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
    The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
    Of this child-changed father!

Doctor

    So please your majesty
    That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.

CORDELIA

    Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
    I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?

Gentleman

    Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep
    We put fresh garments on him.

Doctor

    Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;
    I doubt not of his temperance.

CORDELIA

    Very well.

Doctor

    Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!

CORDELIA

    O my dear father! Restoration hang
    Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
    Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
    Have in thy reverence made!

KENT

    Kind and dear princess!

CORDELIA

    Had you not been their father, these white flakes
    Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
    To be opposed against the warring winds?
    To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
    In the most terrible and nimble stroke
    Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
    With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
    Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
    Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
    To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
    In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
    'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
    Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.

Doctor

    Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.

CORDELIA

    How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?

KING LEAR

    You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:
    Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
    Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
    Do scald like moulten lead.

CORDELIA

    Sir, do you know me?

KING LEAR

    You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?

CORDELIA

    Still, still, far wide!

Doctor

    He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.

KING LEAR

    Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
    I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,
    To see another thus. I know not what to say.
    I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;
    I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
    Of my condition!

CORDELIA

    O, look upon me, sir,
    And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:
    No, sir, you must not kneel.

KING LEAR

    Pray, do not mock me:
    I am a very foolish fond old man,
    Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
    And, to deal plainly,
    I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
    Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
    Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
    What place this is; and all the skill I have
    Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
    Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
    For, as I am a man, I think this lady
    To be my child Cordelia.

CORDELIA

    And so I am, I am.

KING LEAR

    Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:
    If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
    I know you do not love me; for your sisters
    Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:
    You have some cause, they have not.

CORDELIA

    No cause, no cause.

KING LEAR

    Am I in France?

KENT

    In your own kingdom, sir.

KING LEAR

    Do not abuse me.

Doctor

    Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
    You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
    To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
    Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
    Till further settling.

CORDELIA

    Will't please your highness walk?

KING LEAR

    You must bear with me:
    Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.

    Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman

Gentleman

    Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?

KENT

    Most certain, sir.

Gentleman

    Who is conductor of his people?

KENT

    As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.

Gentleman

    They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl
    of Kent in Germany.

KENT

    Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the
    powers of the kingdom approach apace.

Gentleman

    The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you
    well, sir.

    Exit

KENT

    My point and period will be throughly wrought,
    Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.

    Exit

ACT V
SCENE I. The British camp, near Dover.

    Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN, Gentlemen, and Soldiers.

EDMUND

    Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
    Or whether since he is advised by aught
    To change the course: he's full of alteration
    And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.

    To a Gentleman, who goes out

REGAN

    Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.

EDMUND

    'Tis to be doubted, madam.

REGAN

    Now, sweet lord,
    You know the goodness I intend upon you:
    Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,
    Do you not love my sister?

EDMUND

    In honour'd love.

REGAN

    But have you never found my brother's way
    To the forfended place?

EDMUND

    That thought abuses you.

REGAN

    I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
    And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.

EDMUND

    No, by mine honour, madam.

REGAN

    I never shall endure her: dear my lord,
    Be not familiar with her.

EDMUND

    Fear me not:
    She and the duke her husband!

    Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers

GONERIL

    [Aside] I had rather lose the battle than that sister
    Should loosen him and me.

ALBANY

    Our very loving sister, well be-met.
    Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,
    With others whom the rigor of our state
    Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
    I never yet was valiant: for this business,
    It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
    Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,
    Most just and heavy causes make oppose.

EDMUND

    Sir, you speak nobly.

REGAN

    Why is this reason'd?

GONERIL

    Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
    For these domestic and particular broils
    Are not the question here.

ALBANY

    Let's then determine
    With the ancient of war on our proceedings.

EDMUND

    I shall attend you presently at your tent.

REGAN

    Sister, you'll go with us?

GONERIL

    No.

REGAN

    'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.

GONERIL

    [Aside] O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.

    As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised

EDGAR

    If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
    Hear me one word.

ALBANY

    I'll overtake you. Speak.

    Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR

EDGAR

    Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
    If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
    For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
    I can produce a champion that will prove
    What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
    Your business of the world hath so an end,
    And machination ceases. Fortune love you.

ALBANY

    Stay till I have read the letter.

EDGAR

    I was forbid it.
    When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
    And I'll appear again.

ALBANY

    Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.

    Exit EDGAR

    Re-enter EDMUND

EDMUND

    The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
    Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
    By diligent discovery; but your haste
    Is now urged on you.

ALBANY

    We will greet the time.

    Exit

EDMUND

    To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
    Each jealous of the other, as the stung
    Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
    Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
    If both remain alive: to take the widow
    Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
    And hardly shall I carry out my side,
    Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
    His countenance for the battle; which being done,
    Let her who would be rid of him devise
    His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
    Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
    The battle done, and they within our power,
    Shall never see his pardon; for my state
    Stands on me to defend, not to debate.

    Exit

SCENE II. A field between the two camps.

    Alarum within. Enter, with drum and colours, KING LEAR, CORDELIA, and Soldiers, over the stage; and exeunt

    Enter EDGAR and GLOUCESTER

EDGAR

    Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
    For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
    If ever I return to you again,
    I'll bring you comfort.

GLOUCESTER

    Grace go with you, sir!

    Exit EDGAR

    Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter EDGAR

EDGAR

    Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!
    King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
    Give me thy hand; come on.

GLOUCESTER

    No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.

EDGAR

    What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
    Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
    Ripeness is all: come on.

GLOUCESTER

    And that's true too.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The British camp near Dover.

    Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, EDMUND, KING LEAR and CORDELIA, prisoners; Captain, Soldiers, & c

EDMUND

    Some officers take them away: good guard,
    Until their greater pleasures first be known
    That are to censure them.

CORDELIA

    We are not the first
    Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
    For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
    Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
    Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?

KING LEAR

    No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:
    We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
    When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
    And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
    And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
    At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
    Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
    Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
    And take upon's the mystery of things,
    As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
    In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
    That ebb and flow by the moon.

EDMUND

    Take them away.

KING LEAR

    Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
    The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
    He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
    And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
    The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
    Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve
    first. Come.

    Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded

EDMUND

    Come hither, captain; hark.
    Take thou this note;

    Giving a paper
    go follow them to prison:
    One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost
    As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
    To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men
    Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
    Does not become a sword: thy great employment
    Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,
    Or thrive by other means.

Captain

    I'll do 't, my lord.

EDMUND

    About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
    Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so
    As I have set it down.

Captain

    I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
    If it be man's work, I'll do 't.

    Exit

    Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another Captain, and Soldiers

ALBANY

    Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,
    And fortune led you well: you have the captives
    That were the opposites of this day's strife:
    We do require them of you, so to use them
    As we shall find their merits and our safety
    May equally determine.

EDMUND

    Sir, I thought it fit
    To send the old and miserable king
    To some retention and appointed guard;
    Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
    To pluck the common bosom on his side,
    An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
    Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
    My reason all the same; and they are ready
    To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
    Where you shall hold your session. At this time
    We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
    And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed
    By those that feel their sharpness:
    The question of Cordelia and her father
    Requires a fitter place.

ALBANY

    Sir, by your patience,
    I hold you but a subject of this war,
    Not as a brother.

REGAN

    That's as we list to grace him.
    Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
    Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
    Bore the commission of my place and person;
    The which immediacy may well stand up,
    And call itself your brother.

GONERIL

    Not so hot:
    In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
    More than in your addition.

REGAN

    In my rights,
    By me invested, he compeers the best.

GONERIL

    That were the most, if he should husband you.

REGAN

    Jesters do oft prove prophets.

GONERIL

    Holla, holla!
    That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.

REGAN

    Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
    From a full-flowing stomach. General,
    Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
    Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:
    Witness the world, that I create thee here
    My lord and master.

GONERIL

    Mean you to enjoy him?

ALBANY

    The let-alone lies not in your good will.

EDMUND

    Nor in thine, lord.

ALBANY

    Half-blooded fellow, yes.

REGAN

    [To EDMUND] Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.

ALBANY

    Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
    On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,
    This gilded serpent

    Pointing to Goneril
    For your claim, fair sister,
    I bar it in the interest of my wife:
    'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
    And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
    If you will marry, make your loves to me,
    My lady is bespoke.

GONERIL

    An interlude!

ALBANY

    Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:
    If none appear to prove upon thy head
    Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
    There is my pledge;

    Throwing down a glove
    I'll prove it on thy heart,
    Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
    Than I have here proclaim'd thee.

REGAN

    Sick, O, sick!

GONERIL

    [Aside] If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.

EDMUND

    There's my exchange:

    Throwing down a glove
    what in the world he is
    That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:
    Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
    On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
    My truth and honour firmly.

ALBANY

    A herald, ho!

EDMUND

    A herald, ho, a herald!

ALBANY

    Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
    All levied in my name, have in my name
    Took their discharge.

REGAN

    My sickness grows upon me.

ALBANY

    She is not well; convey her to my tent.

    Exit Regan, led

    Enter a Herald
    Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,
    And read out this.

Captain

    Sound, trumpet!

    A trumpet sounds

Herald

    [Reads] 'If any man of quality or degree within
    the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,
    supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold
    traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the
    trumpet: he is bold in his defence.'

EDMUND

    Sound!

    First trumpet

Herald

    Again!

    Second trumpet

Herald

    Again!

    Third trumpet

    Trumpet answers within

    Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a trumpet before him

ALBANY

    Ask him his purposes, why he appears
    Upon this call o' the trumpet.

Herald

    What are you?
    Your name, your quality? and why you answer
    This present summons?

EDGAR

    Know, my name is lost;
    By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
    Yet am I noble as the adversary
    I come to cope.

ALBANY

    Which is that adversary?

EDGAR

    What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?

EDMUND

    Himself: what say'st thou to him?

EDGAR

    Draw thy sword,
    That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
    Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
    Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
    My oath, and my profession: I protest,
    Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
    Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
    Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;
    False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
    Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;
    And, from the extremest upward of thy head
    To the descent and dust below thy foot,
    A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
    This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
    To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
    Thou liest.

EDMUND

    In wisdom I should ask thy name;
    But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
    And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
    What safe and nicely I might well delay
    By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:
    Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;
    With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
    Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
    This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
    Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!

    Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls

ALBANY

    Save him, save him!

GONERIL

    This is practise, Gloucester:
    By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
    An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,
    But cozen'd and beguiled.

ALBANY

    Shut your mouth, dame,
    Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:
    Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:
    No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.

    Gives the letter to EDMUND

GONERIL

    Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:
    Who can arraign me for't.

ALBANY

    Most monstrous! oh!
    Know'st thou this paper?

GONERIL

    Ask me not what I know.

    Exit

ALBANY

    Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.

EDMUND

    What you have charged me with, that have I done;
    And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
    'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
    That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
    I do forgive thee.

EDGAR

    Let's exchange charity.
    I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
    If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
    My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
    The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
    Make instruments to plague us:
    The dark and vicious place where thee he got
    Cost him his eyes.

EDMUND

    Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
    The wheel is come full circle: I am here.

ALBANY

    Methought thy very gait did prophesy
    A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
    Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
    Did hate thee or thy father!

EDGAR

    Worthy prince, I know't.

ALBANY

    Where have you hid yourself?
    How have you known the miseries of your father?

EDGAR

    By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
    And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
    The bloody proclamation to escape,
    That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
    That we the pain of death would hourly die
    Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
    Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
    That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
    Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
    Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
    Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
    Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
    Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
    Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
    I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
    Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
    Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
    'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
    Burst smilingly.

EDMUND

    This speech of yours hath moved me,
    And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
    You look as you had something more to say.

ALBANY

    If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
    For I am almost ready to dissolve,
    Hearing of this.

EDGAR

    This would have seem'd a period
    To such as love not sorrow; but another,
    To amplify too much, would make much more,
    And top extremity.
    Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
    Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
    Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
    Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
    He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
    As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
    Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
    That ever ear received: which in recounting
    His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
    Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
    And there I left him tranced.

ALBANY

    But who was this?

EDGAR

    Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
    Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
    Improper for a slave.

    Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife

Gentleman

    Help, help, O, help!

EDGAR

    What kind of help?

ALBANY

    Speak, man.

EDGAR

    What means that bloody knife?

Gentleman

    'Tis hot, it smokes;
    It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!

ALBANY

    Who dead? speak, man.

Gentleman

    Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
    By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.

EDMUND

    I was contracted to them both: all three
    Now marry in an instant.

EDGAR

    Here comes Kent.

ALBANY

    Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:
    This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
    Touches us not with pity.

    Exit Gentleman

    Enter KENT
    O, is this he?
    The time will not allow the compliment
    Which very manners urges.

KENT

    I am come
    To bid my king and master aye good night:
    Is he not here?

ALBANY

    Great thing of us forgot!
    Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
    See'st thou this object, Kent?

    The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in

KENT

    Alack, why thus?

EDMUND

    Yet Edmund was beloved:
    The one the other poison'd for my sake,
    And after slew herself.

ALBANY

    Even so. Cover their faces.

EDMUND

    I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
    Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
    Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
    Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
    Nay, send in time.

ALBANY

    Run, run, O, run!

EDGAR

    To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
    Thy token of reprieve.

EDMUND

    Well thought on: take my sword,
    Give it the captain.

ALBANY

    Haste thee, for thy life.

    Exit EDGAR

EDMUND

    He hath commission from thy wife and me
    To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
    To lay the blame upon her own despair,
    That she fordid herself.

ALBANY

    The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.

    EDMUND is borne off

    Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms; EDGAR, Captain, and others following

KING LEAR

    Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:
    Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
    That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
    I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
    She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
    If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
    Why, then she lives.

KENT

    Is this the promised end

EDGAR

    Or image of that horror?

ALBANY

    Fall, and cease!

KING LEAR

    This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
    It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
    That ever I have felt.

KENT

    [Kneeling] O my good master!

KING LEAR

    Prithee, away.

EDGAR

    'Tis noble Kent, your friend.

KING LEAR

    A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
    I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
    Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
    What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,
    Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
    I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.

Captain

    'Tis true, my lords, he did.

KING LEAR

    Did I not, fellow?
    I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
    I would have made them skip: I am old now,
    And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
    Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.

KENT

    If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
    One of them we behold.

KING LEAR

    This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?

KENT

    The same,
    Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?

KING LEAR

    He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
    He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.

KENT

    No, my good lord; I am the very man,--

KING LEAR

    I'll see that straight.

KENT

    That, from your first of difference and decay,
    Have follow'd your sad steps.

KING LEAR

    You are welcome hither.

KENT

    Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
    Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,
    And desperately are dead.

KING LEAR

    Ay, so I think.

ALBANY

    He knows not what he says: and vain it is
    That we present us to him.

EDGAR

    Very bootless.

    Enter a Captain

Captain

    Edmund is dead, my lord.

ALBANY

    That's but a trifle here.
    You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
    What comfort to this great decay may come
    Shall be applied: for us we will resign,
    During the life of this old majesty,
    To him our absolute power:

    To EDGAR and KENT
    you, to your rights:
    With boot, and such addition as your honours
    Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
    The wages of their virtue, and all foes
    The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!

KING LEAR

    And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
    Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
    And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
    Never, never, never, never, never!
    Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
    Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
    Look there, look there!

    Dies

EDGAR

    He faints! My lord, my lord!

KENT

    Break, heart; I prithee, break!

EDGAR

    Look up, my lord.

KENT

    Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much
    That would upon the rack of this tough world
    Stretch him out longer.

EDGAR

    He is gone, indeed.

KENT

    The wonder is, he hath endured so long:
    He but usurp'd his life.

ALBANY

    Bear them from hence. Our present business
    Is general woe.

    To KENT and EDGAR
    Friends of my soul, you twain
    Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.

KENT

    I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
    My master calls me, I must not say no.

ALBANY

    The weight of this sad time we must obey;
    Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
    The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
    Shall never see so much, nor live so long.

    Exeunt, with a dead march


The Tragedy of Macbeth

ACT I
SCENE I. A desert place.

    Thunder and lightning. Enter three Witches

First Witch

    When shall we three meet again
    In thunder, lightning, or in rain?

Second Witch

    When the hurlyburly's done,
    When the battle's lost and won.

Third Witch

    That will be ere the set of sun.

First Witch

    Where the place?

Second Witch

    Upon the heath.

Third Witch

    There to meet with Macbeth.

First Witch

    I come, Graymalkin!

Second Witch

    Paddock calls.

Third Witch

    Anon.

ALL

    Fair is foul, and foul is fair:
    Hover through the fog and filthy air.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A camp near Forres.

    Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant

DUNCAN

    What bloody man is that? He can report,
    As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
    The newest state.

MALCOLM

    This is the sergeant
    Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
    'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
    Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
    As thou didst leave it.

Sergeant

    Doubtful it stood;
    As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
    And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
    Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
    The multiplying villanies of nature
    Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
    Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
    And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
    Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
    For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
    Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
    Which smoked with bloody execution,
    Like valour's minion carved out his passage
    Till he faced the slave;
    Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
    Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
    And fix'd his head upon our battlements.

DUNCAN

    O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!

Sergeant

    As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
    Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
    So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
    Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
    No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
    Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
    But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
    With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
    Began a fresh assault.

DUNCAN

    Dismay'd not this
    Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?

Sergeant

    Yes;
    As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
    If I say sooth, I must report they were
    As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
    Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
    Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
    Or memorise another Golgotha,
    I cannot tell.
    But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.

DUNCAN

    So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
    They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.

    Exit Sergeant, attended
    Who comes here?

    Enter ROSS

MALCOLM

    The worthy thane of Ross.

LENNOX

    What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
    That seems to speak things strange.

ROSS

    God save the king!

DUNCAN

    Whence camest thou, worthy thane?

ROSS

    From Fife, great king;
    Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
    And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
    With terrible numbers,
    Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
    The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
    Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
    Confronted him with self-comparisons,
    Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
    Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
    The victory fell on us.

DUNCAN

    Great happiness!

ROSS

    That now
    Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
    Nor would we deign him burial of his men
    Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
    Ten thousand dollars to our general use.

DUNCAN

    No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
    Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
    And with his former title greet Macbeth.

ROSS

    I'll see it done.

DUNCAN

    What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A heath near Forres.

    Thunder. Enter the three Witches

First Witch

    Where hast thou been, sister?

Second Witch

    Killing swine.

Third Witch

    Sister, where thou?

First Witch

    A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
    And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
    'Give me,' quoth I:
    'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
    Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
    But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
    And, like a rat without a tail,
    I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.

Second Witch

    I'll give thee a wind.

First Witch

    Thou'rt kind.

Third Witch

    And I another.

First Witch

    I myself have all the other,
    And the very ports they blow,
    All the quarters that they know
    I' the shipman's card.
    I will drain him dry as hay:
    Sleep shall neither night nor day
    Hang upon his pent-house lid;
    He shall live a man forbid:
    Weary se'nnights nine times nine
    Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
    Though his bark cannot be lost,
    Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
    Look what I have.

Second Witch

    Show me, show me.

First Witch

    Here I have a pilot's thumb,
    Wreck'd as homeward he did come.

    Drum within

Third Witch

    A drum, a drum!
    Macbeth doth come.

ALL

    The weird sisters, hand in hand,
    Posters of the sea and land,
    Thus do go about, about:
    Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
    And thrice again, to make up nine.
    Peace! the charm's wound up.

    Enter MACBETH and BANQUO

MACBETH

    So foul and fair a day I have not seen.

BANQUO

    How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
    So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
    That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
    And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
    That man may question? You seem to understand me,
    By each at once her chappy finger laying
    Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
    And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
    That you are so.

MACBETH

    Speak, if you can: what are you?

First Witch

    All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!

Second Witch

    All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!

Third Witch

    All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!

BANQUO

    Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
    Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
    Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
    Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
    You greet with present grace and great prediction
    Of noble having and of royal hope,
    That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
    If you can look into the seeds of time,
    And say which grain will grow and which will not,
    Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
    Your favours nor your hate.

First Witch

    Hail!

Second Witch

    Hail!

Third Witch

    Hail!

First Witch

    Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.

Second Witch

    Not so happy, yet much happier.

Third Witch

    Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
    So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!

First Witch

    Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!

MACBETH

    Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
    By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
    But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
    A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
    Stands not within the prospect of belief,
    No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
    You owe this strange intelligence? or why
    Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
    With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.

    Witches vanish

BANQUO

    The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
    And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?

MACBETH

    Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
    As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!

BANQUO

    Were such things here as we do speak about?
    Or have we eaten on the insane root
    That takes the reason prisoner?

MACBETH

    Your children shall be kings.

BANQUO

    You shall be king.

MACBETH

    And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?

BANQUO

    To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?

    Enter ROSS and ANGUS

ROSS

    The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
    The news of thy success; and when he reads
    Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
    His wonders and his praises do contend
    Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
    In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
    He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
    Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
    Strange images of death. As thick as hail
    Came post with post; and every one did bear
    Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
    And pour'd them down before him.

ANGUS

    We are sent
    To give thee from our royal master thanks;
    Only to herald thee into his sight,
    Not pay thee.

ROSS

    And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
    He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
    In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
    For it is thine.

BANQUO

    What, can the devil speak true?

MACBETH

    The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
    In borrow'd robes?

ANGUS

    Who was the thane lives yet;
    But under heavy judgment bears that life
    Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
    With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
    With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
    He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
    But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
    Have overthrown him.

MACBETH

    [Aside] Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
    The greatest is behind.

    To ROSS and ANGUS
    Thanks for your pains.

    To BANQUO
    Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
    When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
    Promised no less to them?

BANQUO

    That trusted home
    Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
    Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
    And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
    The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
    Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
    In deepest consequence.
    Cousins, a word, I pray you.

MACBETH

    [Aside] Two truths are told,
    As happy prologues to the swelling act
    Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.

    Aside
    Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
    Why hath it given me earnest of success,
    Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
    If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
    Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
    And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
    Against the use of nature? Present fears
    Are less than horrible imaginings:
    My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
    Shakes so my single state of man that function
    Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
    But what is not.

BANQUO

    Look, how our partner's rapt.

MACBETH

    [Aside] If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
    Without my stir.

BANQUO

    New horrors come upon him,
    Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
    But with the aid of use.

MACBETH

    [Aside] Come what come may,
    Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.

BANQUO

    Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.

MACBETH

    Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
    With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
    Are register'd where every day I turn
    The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
    Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
    The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
    Our free hearts each to other.

BANQUO

    Very gladly.

MACBETH

    Till then, enough. Come, friends.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Forres. The palace.

    Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX, and Attendants

DUNCAN

    Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
    Those in commission yet return'd?

MALCOLM

    My liege,
    They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
    With one that saw him die: who did report
    That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
    Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
    A deep repentance: nothing in his life
    Became him like the leaving it; he died
    As one that had been studied in his death
    To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
    As 'twere a careless trifle.

DUNCAN

    There's no art
    To find the mind's construction in the face:
    He was a gentleman on whom I built
    An absolute trust.

    Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS
    O worthiest cousin!
    The sin of my ingratitude even now
    Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
    That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
    To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
    That the proportion both of thanks and payment
    Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
    More is thy due than more than all can pay.

MACBETH

    The service and the loyalty I owe,
    In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
    Is to receive our duties; and our duties
    Are to your throne and state children and servants,
    Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
    Safe toward your love and honour.

DUNCAN

    Welcome hither:
    I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
    To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
    That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
    No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
    And hold thee to my heart.

BANQUO

    There if I grow,
    The harvest is your own.

DUNCAN

    My plenteous joys,
    Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
    In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
    And you whose places are the nearest, know
    We will establish our estate upon
    Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
    The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
    Not unaccompanied invest him only,
    But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
    On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
    And bind us further to you.

MACBETH

    The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
    I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
    The hearing of my wife with your approach;
    So humbly take my leave.

DUNCAN

    My worthy Cawdor!

MACBETH

    [Aside] The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
    On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
    For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
    Let not light see my black and deep desires:
    The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,
    Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.

    Exit

DUNCAN

    True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
    And in his commendations I am fed;
    It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
    Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
    It is a peerless kinsman.

    Flourish. Exeunt

SCENE V. Inverness. Macbeth's castle.

    Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter

LADY MACBETH

    'They met me in the day of success: and I have
    learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
    them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
    to question them further, they made themselves air,
    into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
    the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
    all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
    before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
    me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
    shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
    thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
    mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
    ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
    to thy heart, and farewell.'
    Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
    What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
    It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
    To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
    Art not without ambition, but without
    The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
    That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
    And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
    That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
    And that which rather thou dost fear to do
    Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
    That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
    And chastise with the valour of my tongue
    All that impedes thee from the golden round,
    Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
    To have thee crown'd withal.

    Enter a Messenger
    What is your tidings?

Messenger

    The king comes here to-night.

LADY MACBETH

    Thou'rt mad to say it:
    Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
    Would have inform'd for preparation.

Messenger

    So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:
    One of my fellows had the speed of him,
    Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
    Than would make up his message.

LADY MACBETH

    Give him tending;
    He brings great news.

    Exit Messenger
    The raven himself is hoarse
    That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
    Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
    That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
    And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
    Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
    Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
    That no compunctious visitings of nature
    Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
    The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
    And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
    Wherever in your sightless substances
    You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
    And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
    That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
    Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
    To cry 'Hold, hold!'

    Enter MACBETH
    Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
    Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
    Thy letters have transported me beyond
    This ignorant present, and I feel now
    The future in the instant.

MACBETH

    My dearest love,
    Duncan comes here to-night.

LADY MACBETH

    And when goes hence?

MACBETH

    To-morrow, as he purposes.

LADY MACBETH

    O, never
    Shall sun that morrow see!
    Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
    May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
    Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
    Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
    But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
    Must be provided for: and you shall put
    This night's great business into my dispatch;
    Which shall to all our nights and days to come
    Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.

MACBETH

    We will speak further.

LADY MACBETH

    Only look up clear;
    To alter favour ever is to fear:
    Leave all the rest to me.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Before Macbeth's castle.

    Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS, and Attendants

DUNCAN

    This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
    Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
    Unto our gentle senses.

BANQUO

    This guest of summer,
    The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
    By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
    Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
    Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
    Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
    Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
    The air is delicate.

    Enter LADY MACBETH

DUNCAN

    See, see, our honour'd hostess!
    The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
    Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
    How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
    And thank us for your trouble.

LADY MACBETH

    All our service
    In every point twice done and then done double
    Were poor and single business to contend
    Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
    Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
    And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
    We rest your hermits.

DUNCAN

    Where's the thane of Cawdor?
    We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
    To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
    And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
    To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
    We are your guest to-night.

LADY MACBETH

    Your servants ever
    Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,
    To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
    Still to return your own.

DUNCAN

    Give me your hand;
    Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
    And shall continue our graces towards him.
    By your leave, hostess.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. Macbeth's castle.

    Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the stage. Then enter MACBETH

MACBETH

    If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
    It were done quickly: if the assassination
    Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
    With his surcease success; that but this blow
    Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
    But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
    We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
    We still have judgment here; that we but teach
    Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
    To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
    Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
    To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
    First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
    Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
    Who should against his murderer shut the door,
    Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
    Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
    So clear in his great office, that his virtues
    Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
    The deep damnation of his taking-off;
    And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
    Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
    Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
    Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
    That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
    To prick the sides of my intent, but only
    Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
    And falls on the other.

    Enter LADY MACBETH
    How now! what news?

LADY MACBETH

    He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?

MACBETH

    Hath he ask'd for me?

LADY MACBETH

    Know you not he has?

MACBETH

    We will proceed no further in this business:
    He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
    Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
    Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
    Not cast aside so soon.

LADY MACBETH

    Was the hope drunk
    Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
    And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
    At what it did so freely? From this time
    Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
    To be the same in thine own act and valour
    As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
    Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
    And live a coward in thine own esteem,
    Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
    Like the poor cat i' the adage?

MACBETH

    Prithee, peace:
    I dare do all that may become a man;
    Who dares do more is none.

LADY MACBETH

    What beast was't, then,
    That made you break this enterprise to me?
    When you durst do it, then you were a man;
    And, to be more than what you were, you would
    Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
    Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
    They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
    Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
    How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
    I would, while it was smiling in my face,
    Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
    And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
    Have done to this.

MACBETH

    If we should fail?

LADY MACBETH

    We fail!
    But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
    And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--
    Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
    Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
    Will I with wine and wassail so convince
    That memory, the warder of the brain,
    Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
    A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
    Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
    What cannot you and I perform upon
    The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
    His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
    Of our great quell?

MACBETH

    Bring forth men-children only;
    For thy undaunted mettle should compose
    Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
    When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
    Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
    That they have done't?

LADY MACBETH

    Who dares receive it other,
    As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
    Upon his death?

MACBETH

    I am settled, and bend up
    Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
    Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
    False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

    Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Court of Macbeth's castle.

    Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him

BANQUO

    How goes the night, boy?

FLEANCE

    The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.

BANQUO

    And she goes down at twelve.

FLEANCE

    I take't, 'tis later, sir.

BANQUO

    Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
    Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
    A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
    And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
    Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
    Gives way to in repose!

    Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch
    Give me my sword.
    Who's there?

MACBETH

    A friend.

BANQUO

    What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
    He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
    Sent forth great largess to your offices.
    This diamond he greets your wife withal,
    By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
    In measureless content.

MACBETH

    Being unprepared,
    Our will became the servant to defect;
    Which else should free have wrought.

BANQUO

    All's well.
    I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
    To you they have show'd some truth.

MACBETH

    I think not of them:
    Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
    We would spend it in some words upon that business,
    If you would grant the time.

BANQUO

    At your kind'st leisure.

MACBETH

    If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
    It shall make honour for you.

BANQUO

    So I lose none
    In seeking to augment it, but still keep
    My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
    I shall be counsell'd.

MACBETH

    Good repose the while!

BANQUO

    Thanks, sir: the like to you!

    Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE

MACBETH

    Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
    She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.

    Exit Servant
    Is this a dagger which I see before me,
    The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
    I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
    Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
    To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
    A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
    Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
    I see thee yet, in form as palpable
    As this which now I draw.
    Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
    And such an instrument I was to use.
    Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
    Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
    And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
    Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
    It is the bloody business which informs
    Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
    Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
    The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
    Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
    Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
    Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
    With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
    Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
    Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
    Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
    And take the present horror from the time,
    Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
    Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.

    A bell rings
    I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
    Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
    That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

    Exit

SCENE II. The same.

    Enter LADY MACBETH

LADY MACBETH

    That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
    What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
    Hark! Peace!
    It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
    Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
    The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
    Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
    their possets,
    That death and nature do contend about them,
    Whether they live or die.

MACBETH

    [Within] Who's there? what, ho!

LADY MACBETH

    Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
    And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
    Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
    He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
    My father as he slept, I had done't.

    Enter MACBETH
    My husband!

MACBETH

    I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?

LADY MACBETH

    I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
    Did not you speak?

MACBETH

    When?

LADY MACBETH

    Now.

MACBETH

    As I descended?

LADY MACBETH

    Ay.

MACBETH

    Hark!
    Who lies i' the second chamber?

LADY MACBETH

    Donalbain.

MACBETH

    This is a sorry sight.

    Looking on his hands

LADY MACBETH

    A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.

MACBETH

    There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
    'Murder!'
    That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
    But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
    Again to sleep.

LADY MACBETH

    There are two lodged together.

MACBETH

    One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
    As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
    Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
    When they did say 'God bless us!'

LADY MACBETH

    Consider it not so deeply.

MACBETH

    But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
    I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
    Stuck in my throat.

LADY MACBETH

    These deeds must not be thought
    After these ways; so, it will make us mad.

MACBETH

    Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
    Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
    Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
    The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
    Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
    Chief nourisher in life's feast,--

LADY MACBETH

    What do you mean?

MACBETH

    Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
    'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
    Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'

LADY MACBETH

    Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
    You do unbend your noble strength, to think
    So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
    And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
    Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
    They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
    The sleepy grooms with blood.

MACBETH

    I'll go no more:
    I am afraid to think what I have done;
    Look on't again I dare not.

LADY MACBETH

    Infirm of purpose!
    Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
    Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
    That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
    I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
    For it must seem their guilt.

    Exit. Knocking within

MACBETH

    Whence is that knocking?
    How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
    What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
    Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
    Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
    The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,
    Making the green one red.

    Re-enter LADY MACBETH

LADY MACBETH

    My hands are of your colour; but I shame
    To wear a heart so white.

    Knocking within
    I hear a knocking
    At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
    A little water clears us of this deed:
    How easy is it, then! Your constancy
    Hath left you unattended.

    Knocking within
    Hark! more knocking.
    Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
    And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
    So poorly in your thoughts.

MACBETH

    To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.

    Knocking within
    Wake Duncan with thy knocking! I would thou couldst!

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The same.

    Knocking within. Enter a Porter

Porter

    Here's a knocking indeed! If a
    man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
    old turning the key.

    Knocking within
    Knock,
    knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
    Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
    himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
    time; have napkins enow about you; here
    you'll sweat for't.

    Knocking within
    Knock,
    knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
    name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
    swear in both the scales against either scale;
    who committed treason enough for God's sake,
    yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
    in, equivocator.

    Knocking within
    Knock,
    knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
    English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
    a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
    roast your goose.

    Knocking within
    Knock,
    knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
    this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
    it no further: I had thought to have let in
    some of all professions that go the primrose
    way to the everlasting bonfire.

    Knocking within
    Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.

    Opens the gate

    Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX

MACDUFF

    Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
    That you do lie so late?

Porter

    'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
    second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
    provoker of three things.

MACDUFF

    What three things does drink especially provoke?

Porter

    Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
    urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
    it provokes the desire, but it takes
    away the performance: therefore, much drink
    may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
    it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
    him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
    and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
    not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
    in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.

MACDUFF

    I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.

Porter

    That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
    me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I
    think, being too strong for him, though he took
    up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
    him.

MACDUFF

    Is thy master stirring?

    Enter MACBETH
    Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.

LENNOX

    Good morrow, noble sir.

MACBETH

    Good morrow, both.

MACDUFF

    Is the king stirring, worthy thane?

MACBETH

    Not yet.

MACDUFF

    He did command me to call timely on him:
    I have almost slipp'd the hour.

MACBETH

    I'll bring you to him.

MACDUFF

    I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
    But yet 'tis one.

MACBETH

    The labour we delight in physics pain.
    This is the door.

MACDUFF

    I'll make so bold to call,
    For 'tis my limited service.

    Exit

LENNOX

    Goes the king hence to-day?

MACBETH

    He does: he did appoint so.

LENNOX

    The night has been unruly: where we lay,
    Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
    Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
    And prophesying with accents terrible
    Of dire combustion and confused events
    New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
    Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
    Was feverous and did shake.

MACBETH

    'Twas a rough night.

LENNOX

    My young remembrance cannot parallel
    A fellow to it.

    Re-enter MACDUFF

MACDUFF

    O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
    Cannot conceive nor name thee!

MACBETH LENNOX

    What's the matter.

MACDUFF

    Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
    Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
    The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
    The life o' the building!

MACBETH

    What is 't you say? the life?

LENNOX

    Mean you his majesty?

MACDUFF

    Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
    With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
    See, and then speak yourselves.

    Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX
    Awake, awake!
    Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
    Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
    Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
    And look on death itself! up, up, and see
    The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
    As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
    To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.

    Bell rings

    Enter LADY MACBETH

LADY MACBETH

    What's the business,
    That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
    The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!

MACDUFF

    O gentle lady,
    'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
    The repetition, in a woman's ear,
    Would murder as it fell.

    Enter BANQUO
    O Banquo, Banquo,
    Our royal master 's murder'd!

LADY MACBETH

    Woe, alas!
    What, in our house?

BANQUO

    Too cruel any where.
    Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
    And say it is not so.

    Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS

MACBETH

    Had I but died an hour before this chance,
    I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
    There 's nothing serious in mortality:
    All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
    The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
    Is left this vault to brag of.

    Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN

DONALBAIN

    What is amiss?

MACBETH

    You are, and do not know't:
    The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
    Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.

MACDUFF

    Your royal father 's murder'd.

MALCOLM

    O, by whom?

LENNOX

    Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
    Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
    So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
    Upon their pillows:
    They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
    Was to be trusted with them.

MACBETH

    O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
    That I did kill them.

MACDUFF

    Wherefore did you so?

MACBETH

    Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
    Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
    The expedition my violent love
    Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
    His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
    And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
    For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
    Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
    Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
    That had a heart to love, and in that heart
    Courage to make 's love kno wn?

LADY MACBETH

    Help me hence, ho!

MACDUFF

    Look to the lady.

MALCOLM

    [Aside to DONALBAIN] Why do we hold our tongues,
    That most may claim this argument for ours?

DONALBAIN

    [Aside to MALCOLM] What should be spoken here,
    where our fate,
    Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?
    Let 's away;
    Our tears are not yet brew'd.

MALCOLM

    [Aside to DONALBAIN] Nor our strong sorrow
    Upon the foot of motion.

BANQUO

    Look to the lady:

    LADY MACBETH is carried out
    And when we have our naked frailties hid,
    That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
    And question this most bloody piece of work,
    To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
    In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
    Against the undivulged pretence I fight
    Of treasonous malice.

MACDUFF

    And so do I.

ALL

    So all.

MACBETH

    Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
    And meet i' the hall together.

ALL

    Well contented.

    Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.

MALCOLM

    What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
    To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
    Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.

DONALBAIN

    To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
    Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
    There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
    The nearer bloody.

MALCOLM

    This murderous shaft that's shot
    Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
    Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
    And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
    But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
    Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Outside Macbeth's castle.

    Enter ROSS and an old Man

Old Man

    Threescore and ten I can remember well:
    Within the volume of which time I have seen
    Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
    Hath trifled former knowings.

ROSS

    Ah, good father,
    Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
    Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
    And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
    Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
    That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
    When living light should kiss it?

Old Man

    'Tis unnatural,
    Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,
    A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
    Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.

ROSS

    And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
    Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
    Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
    Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
    War with mankind.

Old Man

    'Tis said they eat each other.

ROSS

    They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
    That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.

    Enter MACDUFF
    How goes the world, sir, now?

MACDUFF

    Why, see you not?

ROSS

    Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?

MACDUFF

    Those that Macbeth hath slain.

ROSS

    Alas, the day!
    What good could they pretend?

MACDUFF

    They were suborn'd:
    Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
    Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
    Suspicion of the deed.

ROSS

    'Gainst nature still!
    Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
    Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
    The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.

MACDUFF

    He is already named, and gone to Scone
    To be invested.

ROSS

    Where is Duncan's body?

MACDUFF

    Carried to Colmekill,
    The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
    And guardian of their bones.

ROSS

    Will you to Scone?

MACDUFF

    No, cousin, I'll to Fife.

ROSS

    Well, I will thither.

MACDUFF

    Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
    Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!

ROSS

    Farewell, father.

Old Man

    God's benison go with you; and with those
    That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Forres. The palace.

    Enter BANQUO

BANQUO

    Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
    As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
    Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
    It should not stand in thy posterity,
    But that myself should be the root and father
    Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
    As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
    Why, by the verities on thee made good,
    May they not be my oracles as well,
    And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.

    Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and Attendants

MACBETH

    Here's our chief guest.

LADY MACBETH

    If he had been forgotten,
    It had been as a gap in our great feast,
    And all-thing unbecoming.

MACBETH

    To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
    And I'll request your presence.

BANQUO

    Let your highness
    Command upon me; to the which my duties
    Are with a most indissoluble tie
    For ever knit.

MACBETH

    Ride you this afternoon?

BANQUO

    Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH

    We should have else desired your good advice,
    Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
    In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
    Is't far you ride?

BANQUO

    As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
    'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
    I must become a borrower of the night
    For a dark hour or twain.

MACBETH

    Fail not our feast.

BANQUO

    My lord, I will not.

MACBETH

    We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
    In England and in Ireland, not confessing
    Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
    With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,
    When therewithal we shall have cause of state
    Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
    Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?

BANQUO

    Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.

MACBETH

    I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
    And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.

    Exit BANQUO
    Let every man be master of his time
    Till seven at night: to make society
    The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
    Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!

    Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant
    Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
    Our pleasure?

ATTENDANT

    They are, my lord, without the palace gate.

MACBETH

    Bring them before us.

    Exit Attendant
    To be thus is nothing;
    But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
    Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
    Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
    And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
    He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
    To act in safety. There is none but he
    Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
    My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
    Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
    When first they put the name of king upon me,
    And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
    They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
    Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
    And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
    Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
    No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
    For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
    For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
    Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
    Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
    Given to the common enemy of man,
    To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
    Rather than so, come fate into the list.
    And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!

    Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers
    Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.

    Exit Attendant
    Was it not yesterday we spoke together?

First Murderer

    It was, so please your highness.

MACBETH

    Well then, now
    Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
    That it was he in the times past which held you
    So under fortune, which you thought had been
    Our innocent self: this I made good to you
    In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
    How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
    the instruments,
    Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
    To half a soul and to a notion crazed
    Say 'Thus did Banquo.'

First Murderer

    You made it known to us.

MACBETH

    I did so, and went further, which is now
    Our point of second meeting. Do you find
    Your patience so predominant in your nature
    That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
    To pray for this good man and for his issue,
    Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
    And beggar'd yours for ever?

First Murderer

    We are men, my liege.

MACBETH

    Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
    As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
    Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
    All by the name of dogs: the valued file
    Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
    The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
    According to the gift which bounteous nature
    Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
    Particular addition. from the bill
    That writes them all alike: and so of men.
    Now, if you have a station in the file,
    Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;
    And I will put that business in your bosoms,
    Whose execution takes your enemy off,
    Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
    Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
    Which in his death were perfect.

Second Murderer

    I am one, my liege,
    Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
    Have so incensed that I am reckless what
    I do to spite the world.

First Murderer

    And I another
    So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
    That I would set my lie on any chance,
    To mend it, or be rid on't.

MACBETH

    Both of you
    Know Banquo was your enemy.

Both Murderers

    True, my lord.

MACBETH

    So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
    That every minute of his being thrusts
    Against my near'st of life: and though I could
    With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
    And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
    For certain friends that are both his and mine,
    Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
    Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,
    That I to your assistance do make love,
    Masking the business from the common eye
    For sundry weighty reasons.

Second Murderer

    We shall, my lord,
    Perform what you command us.

First Murderer

    Though our lives--

MACBETH

    Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
    I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
    Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
    The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
    And something from the palace; always thought
    That I require a clearness: and with him--
    To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
    Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
    Whose absence is no less material to me
    Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
    Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
    I'll come to you anon.

Both Murderers

    We are resolved, my lord.

MACBETH

    I'll call upon you straight: abide within.

    Exeunt Murderers
    It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
    If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.

    Exit

SCENE II. The palace.

    Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant

LADY MACBETH

    Is Banquo gone from court?

Servant

    Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.

LADY MACBETH

    Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
    For a few words.

Servant

    Madam, I will.

    Exit

LADY MACBETH

    Nought's had, all's spent,
    Where our desire is got without content:
    'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
    Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.

    Enter MACBETH
    How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
    Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
    Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
    With them they think on? Things without all remedy
    Should be without regard: what's done is done.

MACBETH

    We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
    She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
    Remains in danger of her former tooth.
    But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
    worlds suffer,
    Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
    In the affliction of these terrible dreams
    That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
    Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
    Than on the torture of the mind to lie
    In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
    After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
    Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
    Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
    Can touch him further.

LADY MACBETH

    Come on;
    Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
    Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.

MACBETH

    So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
    Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
    Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
    Unsafe the while, that we
    Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
    And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
    Disguising what they are.

LADY MACBETH

    You must leave this.

MACBETH

    O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
    Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.

LADY MACBETH

    But in them nature's copy's not eterne.

MACBETH

    There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
    Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
    His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
    The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
    Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
    A deed of dreadful note.

LADY MACBETH

    What's to be done?

MACBETH

    Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
    Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
    Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
    And with thy bloody and invisible hand
    Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
    Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
    Makes wing to the rooky wood:
    Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
    While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
    Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
    Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
    So, prithee, go with me.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A park near the palace.

    Enter three Murderers

First Murderer

    But who did bid thee join with us?

Third Murderer

    Macbeth.

Second Murderer

    He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
    Our offices and what we have to do
    To the direction just.

First Murderer

    Then stand with us.
    The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
    Now spurs the lated traveller apace
    To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
    The subject of our watch.

Third Murderer

    Hark! I hear horses.

BANQUO

    [Within] Give us a light there, ho!

Second Murderer

    Then 'tis he: the rest
    That are within the note of expectation
    Already are i' the court.

First Murderer

    His horses go about.

Third Murderer

    Almost a mile: but he does usually,
    So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
    Make it their walk.

Second Murderer

    A light, a light!

    Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch

Third Murderer

    'Tis he.

First Murderer

    Stand to't.

BANQUO

    It will be rain to-night.

First Murderer

    Let it come down.

    They set upon BANQUO

BANQUO

    O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
    Thou mayst revenge. O slave!

    Dies. FLEANCE escapes

Third Murderer

    Who did strike out the light?

First Murderer

    Wast not the way?

Third Murderer

    There's but one down; the son is fled.

Second Murderer

    We have lost
    Best half of our affair.

First Murderer

    Well, let's away, and say how much is done.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. Hall in the palace.

    A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH, ROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants

MACBETH

    You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
    And last the hearty welcome.

Lords

    Thanks to your majesty.

MACBETH

    Ourself will mingle with society,
    And play the humble host.
    Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
    We will require her welcome.

LADY MACBETH

    Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
    For my heart speaks they are welcome.

    First Murderer appears at the door

MACBETH

    See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
    Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
    Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
    The table round.

    Approaching the door
    There's blood on thy face.

First Murderer

    'Tis Banquo's then.

MACBETH

    'Tis better thee without than he within.
    Is he dispatch'd?

First Murderer

    My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.

MACBETH

    Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
    That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
    Thou art the nonpareil.

First Murderer

    Most royal sir,
    Fleance is 'scaped.

MACBETH

    Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
    Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
    As broad and general as the casing air:
    But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
    To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?

First Murderer

    Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
    With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
    The least a death to nature.

MACBETH

    Thanks for that:
    There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
    Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
    No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow
    We'll hear, ourselves, again.

    Exit Murderer

LADY MACBETH

    My royal lord,
    You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
    That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
    'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
    From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
    Meeting were bare without it.

MACBETH

    Sweet remembrancer!
    Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
    And health on both!

LENNOX

    May't please your highness sit.

    The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in MACBETH's place

MACBETH

    Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
    Were the graced person of our Banquo present;
    Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
    Than pity for mischance!

ROSS

    His absence, sir,
    Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
    To grace us with your royal company.

MACBETH

    The table's full.

LENNOX

    Here is a place reserved, sir.

MACBETH

    Where?

LENNOX

    Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?

MACBETH

    Which of you have done this?

Lords

    What, my good lord?

MACBETH

    Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
    Thy gory locks at me.

ROSS

    Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.

LADY MACBETH

    Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
    And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
    The fit is momentary; upon a thought
    He will again be well: if much you note him,
    You shall offend him and extend his passion:
    Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?

MACBETH

    Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
    Which might appal the devil.

LADY MACBETH

    O proper stuff!
    This is the very painting of your fear:
    This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
    Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
    Impostors to true fear, would well become
    A woman's story at a winter's fire,
    Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
    Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
    You look but on a stool.

MACBETH

    Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!
    how say you?
    Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
    If charnel-houses and our graves must send
    Those that we bury back, our monuments
    Shall be the maws of kites.

    GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes

LADY MACBETH

    What, quite unmann'd in folly?

MACBETH

    If I stand here, I saw him.

LADY MACBETH

    Fie, for shame!

MACBETH

    Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
    Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;
    Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
    Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
    That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
    And there an end; but now they rise again,
    With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
    And push us from our stools: this is more strange
    Than such a murder is.

LADY MACBETH

    My worthy lord,
    Your noble friends do lack you.

MACBETH

    I do forget.
    Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
    I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
    To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
    Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
    I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
    And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
    Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
    And all to all.

Lords

    Our duties, and the pledge.

    Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO

MACBETH

    Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
    Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
    Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
    Which thou dost glare with!

LADY MACBETH

    Think of this, good peers,
    But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
    Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.

MACBETH

    What man dare, I dare:
    Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
    The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
    Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
    Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
    And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
    If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
    The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
    Unreal mockery, hence!

    GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes
    Why, so: being gone,
    I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.

LADY MACBETH

    You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
    With most admired disorder.

MACBETH

    Can such things be,
    And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
    Without our special wonder? You make me strange
    Even to the disposition that I owe,
    When now I think you can behold such sights,
    And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
    When mine is blanched with fear.

ROSS

    What sights, my lord?

LADY MACBETH

    I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
    Question enrages him. At once, good night:
    Stand not upon the order of your going,
    But go at once.

LENNOX

    Good night; and better health
    Attend his majesty!

LADY MACBETH

    A kind good night to all!

    Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH

MACBETH

    It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
    Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
    Augurs and understood relations have
    By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
    The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?

LADY MACBETH

    Almost at odds with morning, which is which.

MACBETH

    How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
    At our great bidding?

LADY MACBETH

    Did you send to him, sir?

MACBETH

    I hear it by the way; but I will send:
    There's not a one of them but in his house
    I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
    And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:
    More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
    By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
    All causes shall give way: I am in blood
    Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
    Returning were as tedious as go o'er:
    Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
    Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.

LADY MACBETH

    You lack the season of all natures, sleep.

MACBETH

    Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
    Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
    We are yet but young in deed.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. A Heath.

    Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE

First Witch

    Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.

HECATE

    Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
    Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
    To trade and traffic with Macbeth
    In riddles and affairs of death;
    And I, the mistress of your charms,
    The close contriver of all harms,
    Was never call'd to bear my part,
    Or show the glory of our art?
    And, which is worse, all you have done
    Hath been but for a wayward son,
    Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
    Loves for his own ends, not for you.
    But make amends now: get you gone,
    And at the pit of Acheron
    Meet me i' the morning: thither he
    Will come to know his destiny:
    Your vessels and your spells provide,
    Your charms and every thing beside.
    I am for the air; this night I'll spend
    Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
    Great business must be wrought ere noon:
    Upon the corner of the moon
    There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
    I'll catch it ere it come to ground:
    And that distill'd by magic sleights
    Shall raise such artificial sprites
    As by the strength of their illusion
    Shall draw him on to his confusion:
    He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
    He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:
    And you all know, security
    Is mortals' chiefest enemy.

    Music and a song within: 'Come away, come away,' & c
    Hark! I am call'd; my little spirit, see,
    Sits in a foggy cloud, and stays for me.

    Exit

First Witch

    Come, let's make haste; she'll soon be back again.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Forres. The palace.

    Enter LENNOX and another Lord

LENNOX

    My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
    Which can interpret further: only, I say,
    Things have been strangely borne. The
    gracious Duncan
    Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
    And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
    Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
    For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
    Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
    It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
    To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
    How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
    In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
    That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
    Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
    For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
    To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
    He has borne all things well: and I do think
    That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
    As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
    should find
    What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
    But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
    His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
    Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
    Where he bestows himself?

Lord

    The son of Duncan,
    From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
    Lives in the English court, and is received
    Of the most pious Edward with such grace
    That the malevolence of fortune nothing
    Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
    Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
    To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
    That, by the help of these--with Him above
    To ratify the work--we may again
    Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
    Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
    Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
    All which we pine for now: and this report
    Hath so exasperate the king that he
    Prepares for some attempt of war.

LENNOX

    Sent he to Macduff?

Lord

    He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
    The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
    And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
    That clogs me with this answer.'

LENNOX

    And that well might
    Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
    His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
    Fly to the court of England and unfold
    His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
    May soon return to this our suffering country
    Under a hand accursed!

Lord

    I'll send my prayers with him.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. A cavern. In the middle, a boiling cauldron.

    Thunder. Enter the three Witches

First Witch

    Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.

Second Witch

    Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.

Third Witch

    Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.

First Witch

    Round about the cauldron go;
    In the poison'd entrails throw.
    Toad, that under cold stone
    Days and nights has thirty-one
    Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
    Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.

ALL

    Double, double toil and trouble;
    Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.

Second Witch

    Fillet of a fenny snake,
    In the cauldron boil and bake;
    Eye of newt and toe of frog,
    Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
    Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
    Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
    For a charm of powerful trouble,
    Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.

ALL

    Double, double toil and trouble;
    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

Third Witch

    Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
    Witches' mummy, maw and gulf
    Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
    Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,
    Liver of blaspheming Jew,
    Gall of goat, and slips of yew
    Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,
    Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
    Finger of birth-strangled babe
    Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
    Make the gruel thick and slab:
    Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
    For the ingredients of our cauldron.

ALL

    Double, double toil and trouble;
    Fire burn and cauldron bubble.

Second Witch

    Cool it with a baboon's blood,
    Then the charm is firm and good.

    Enter HECATE to the other three Witches

HECATE

    O well done! I commend your pains;
    And every one shall share i' the gains;
    And now about the cauldron sing,
    Live elves and fairies in a ring,
    Enchanting all that you put in.

    Music and a song: 'Black spirits,' & c

    HECATE retires

Second Witch

    By the pricking of my thumbs,
    Something wicked this way comes.
    Open, locks,
    Whoever knocks!

    Enter MACBETH

MACBETH

    How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
    What is't you do?

ALL

    A deed without a name.

MACBETH

    I conjure you, by that which you profess,
    Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
    Though you untie the winds and let them fight
    Against the churches; though the yesty waves
    Confound and swallow navigation up;
    Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
    Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
    Though palaces and pyramids do slope
    Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
    Of nature's germens tumble all together,
    Even till destruction sicken; answer me
    To what I ask you.

First Witch

    Speak.

Second Witch

    Demand.

Third Witch

    We'll answer.

First Witch

    Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
    Or from our masters?

MACBETH

    Call 'em; let me see 'em.

First Witch

    Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten
    Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
    From the murderer's gibbet throw
    Into the flame.

ALL

    Come, high or low;
    Thyself and office deftly show!

    Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head

MACBETH

    Tell me, thou unknown power,--

First Witch

    He knows thy thought:
    Hear his speech, but say thou nought.

First Apparition

    Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
    Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.

    Descends

MACBETH

    Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
    Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
    word more,--

First Witch

    He will not be commanded: here's another,
    More potent than the first.

    Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child

Second Apparition

    Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!

MACBETH

    Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.

Second Apparition

    Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn
    The power of man, for none of woman born
    Shall harm Macbeth.

    Descends

MACBETH

    Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
    But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
    And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
    That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
    And sleep in spite of thunder.

    Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned, with a tree in his hand
    What is this
    That rises like the issue of a king,
    And wears upon his baby-brow the round
    And top of sovereignty?

ALL

    Listen, but speak not to't.

Third Apparition

    Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care
    Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
    Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
    Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
    Shall come against him.

    Descends

MACBETH

    That will never be
    Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
    Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
    Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
    Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
    Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
    To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
    Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
    Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
    Reign in this kingdom?

ALL

    Seek to know no more.

MACBETH

    I will be satisfied: deny me this,
    And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
    Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?

    Hautboys

First Witch

    Show!

Second Witch

    Show!

Third Witch

    Show!

ALL

    Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
    Come like shadows, so depart!

    A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in his hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following

MACBETH

    Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
    Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
    Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
    A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
    Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
    What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
    Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
    And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
    Which shows me many more; and some I see
    That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
    Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
    For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
    And points at them for his.

    Apparitions vanish
    What, is this so?

First Witch

    Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
    Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
    Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
    And show the best of our delights:
    I'll charm the air to give a sound,
    While you perform your antic round:
    That this great king may kindly say,
    Our duties did his welcome pay.

    Music. The witches dance and then vanish, with HECATE

MACBETH

    Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
    Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
    Come in, without there!

    Enter LENNOX

LENNOX

    What's your grace's will?

MACBETH

    Saw you the weird sisters?

LENNOX

    No, my lord.

MACBETH

    Came they not by you?

LENNOX

    No, indeed, my lord.

MACBETH

    Infected be the air whereon they ride;
    And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
    The galloping of horse: who was't came by?

LENNOX

    'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
    Macduff is fled to England.

MACBETH

    Fled to England!

LENNOX

    Ay, my good lord.

MACBETH

    Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
    The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
    Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
    The very firstlings of my heart shall be
    The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
    To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
    The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
    Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
    His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
    That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
    This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
    But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
    Come, bring me where they are.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Fife. Macduff's castle.

    Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS

LADY MACDUFF

    What had he done, to make him fly the land?

ROSS

    You must have patience, madam.

LADY MACDUFF

    He had none:
    His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
    Our fears do make us traitors.

ROSS

    You know not
    Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.

LADY MACDUFF

    Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
    His mansion and his titles in a place
    From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
    He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
    The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
    Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
    All is the fear and nothing is the love;
    As little is the wisdom, where the flight
    So runs against all reason.

ROSS

    My dearest coz,
    I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
    He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
    The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
    much further;
    But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
    And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
    From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
    But float upon a wild and violent sea
    Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
    Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
    Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
    To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
    Blessing upon you!

LADY MACDUFF

    Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.

ROSS

    I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
    It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
    I take my leave at once.

    Exit

LADY MACDUFF

    Sirrah, your father's dead;
    And what will you do now? How will you live?

Son

    As birds do, mother.

LADY MACDUFF

    What, with worms and flies?

Son

    With what I get, I mean; and so do they.

LADY MACDUFF

    Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
    The pitfall nor the gin.

Son

    Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
    My father is not dead, for all your saying.

LADY MACDUFF

    Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?

Son

    Nay, how will you do for a husband?

LADY MACDUFF

    Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.

Son

    Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.

LADY MACDUFF

    Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,
    With wit enough for thee.

Son

    Was my father a traitor, mother?

LADY MACDUFF

    Ay, that he was.

Son

    What is a traitor?

LADY MACDUFF

    Why, one that swears and lies.

Son

    And be all traitors that do so?

LADY MACDUFF

    Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.

Son

    And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?

LADY MACDUFF

    Every one.

Son

    Who must hang them?

LADY MACDUFF

    Why, the honest men.

Son

    Then the liars and swearers are fools,
    for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
    the honest men and hang up them.

LADY MACDUFF

    Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
    But how wilt thou do for a father?

Son

    If he were dead, you'ld weep for
    him: if you would not, it were a good sign
    that I should quickly have a new father.

LADY MACDUFF

    Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!

Messenger

    Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
    Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
    I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
    If you will take a homely man's advice,
    Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
    To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
    To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
    Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
    I dare abide no longer.

    Exit

LADY MACDUFF

    Whither should I fly?
    I have done no harm. But I remember now
    I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
    Is often laudable, to do good sometime
    Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
    Do I put up that womanly defence,
    To say I have done no harm?

    Enter Murderers
    What are these faces?

First Murderer

    Where is your husband?

LADY MACDUFF

    I hope, in no place so unsanctified
    Where such as thou mayst find him.

First Murderer

    He's a traitor.

Son

    Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!

First Murderer

    What, you egg!

    Stabbing him
    Young fry of treachery!

Son

    He has kill'd me, mother:
    Run away, I pray you!

SCENE III. England. Before the King's palace.

    Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF

MALCOLM

    Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there
    Weep our sad bosoms empty.

MACDUFF

    Let us rather
    Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men
    Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
    New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
    Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
    As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
    Like syllable of dolour.

MALCOLM

    What I believe I'll wail,
    What know believe, and what I can redress,
    As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
    What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
    This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
    Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
    He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
    but something
    You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
    To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
    To appease an angry god.

MACDUFF

    I am not treacherous.

MALCOLM

    But Macbeth is.
    A good and virtuous nature may recoil
    In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
    your pardon;
    That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
    Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
    Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
    Yet grace must still look so.

MACDUFF

    I have lost my hopes.

MALCOLM

    Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
    Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
    Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
    Without leave-taking? I pray you,
    Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
    But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
    Whatever I shall think.

MACDUFF

    Bleed, bleed, poor country!
    Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
    For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
    thy wrongs;
    The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
    I would not be the villain that thou think'st
    For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
    And the rich East to boot.

MALCOLM

    Be not offended:
    I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
    I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
    It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
    Is added to her wounds: I think withal
    There would be hands uplifted in my right;
    And here from gracious England have I offer
    Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
    When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
    Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
    Shall have more vices than it had before,
    More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
    By him that shall succeed.

MACDUFF

    What should he be?

MALCOLM

    It is myself I mean: in whom I know
    All the particulars of vice so grafted
    That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
    Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
    Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
    With my confineless harms.

MACDUFF

    Not in the legions
    Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
    In evils to top Macbeth.

MALCOLM

    I grant him bloody,
    Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
    Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
    That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
    In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
    Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
    The cistern of my lust, and my desire
    All continent impediments would o'erbear
    That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
    Than such an one to reign.

MACDUFF

    Boundless intemperance
    In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
    The untimely emptying of the happy throne
    And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
    To take upon you what is yours: you may
    Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
    And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
    We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
    That vulture in you, to devour so many
    As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
    Finding it so inclined.

MALCOLM

    With this there grows
    In my most ill-composed affection such
    A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
    I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
    Desire his jewels and this other's house:
    And my more-having would be as a sauce
    To make me hunger more; that I should forge
    Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
    Destroying them for wealth.

MACDUFF

    This avarice
    Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
    Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
    The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
    Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
    Of your mere own: all these are portable,
    With other graces weigh'd.

MALCOLM

    But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
    As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
    Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
    Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
    I have no relish of them, but abound
    In the division of each several crime,
    Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
    Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
    Uproar the universal peace, confound
    All unity on earth.

MACDUFF

    O Scotland, Scotland!

MALCOLM

    If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
    I am as I have spoken.

MACDUFF

    Fit to govern!
    No, not to live. O nation miserable,
    With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
    When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
    Since that the truest issue of thy throne
    By his own interdiction stands accursed,
    And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
    Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
    Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
    Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
    These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
    Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
    Thy hope ends here!

MALCOLM

    Macduff, this noble passion,
    Child of integrity, hath from my soul
    Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
    To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
    By many of these trains hath sought to win me
    Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
    From over-credulous haste: but God above
    Deal between thee and me! for even now
    I put myself to thy direction, and
    Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
    The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
    For strangers to my nature. I am yet
    Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
    Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
    At no time broke my faith, would not betray
    The devil to his fellow and delight
    No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
    Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
    Is thine and my poor country's to command:
    Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
    Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
    Already at a point, was setting forth.
    Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
    Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?

MACDUFF

    Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
    'Tis hard to reconcile.

    Enter a Doctor

MALCOLM

    Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?

Doctor

    Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
    That stay his cure: their malady convinces
    The great assay of art; but at his touch--
    Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
    They presently amend.

MALCOLM

    I thank you, doctor.

    Exit Doctor

MACDUFF

    What's the disease he means?

MALCOLM

    'Tis call'd the evil:
    A most miraculous work in this good king;
    Which often, since my here-remain in England,
    I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
    Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
    All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
    The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
    Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
    Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
    To the succeeding royalty he leaves
    The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
    He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
    And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
    That speak him full of grace.

    Enter ROSS

MACDUFF

    See, who comes here?

MALCOLM

    My countryman; but yet I know him not.

MACDUFF

    My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.

MALCOLM

    I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
    The means that makes us strangers!

ROSS

    Sir, amen.

MACDUFF

    Stands Scotland where it did?

ROSS

    Alas, poor country!
    Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
    Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
    But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
    Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
    Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
    A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
    Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
    Expire before the flowers in their caps,
    Dying or ere they sicken.

MACDUFF

    O, relation
    Too nice, and yet too true!

MALCOLM

    What's the newest grief?

ROSS

    That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
    Each minute teems a new one.

MACDUFF

    How does my wife?

ROSS

    Why, well.

MACDUFF

    And all my children?

ROSS

    Well too.

MACDUFF

    The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?

ROSS

    No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.

MACDUFF

    But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?

ROSS

    When I came hither to transport the tidings,
    Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
    Of many worthy fellows that were out;
    Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
    For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
    Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
    Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
    To doff their dire distresses.

MALCOLM

    Be't their comfort
    We are coming thither: gracious England hath
    Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
    An older and a better soldier none
    That Christendom gives out.

ROSS

    Would I could answer
    This comfort with the like! But I have words
    That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
    Where hearing should not latch them.

MACDUFF

    What concern they?
    The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
    Due to some single breast?

ROSS

    No mind that's honest
    But in it shares some woe; though the main part
    Pertains to you alone.

MACDUFF

    If it be mine,
    Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.

ROSS

    Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
    Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
    That ever yet they heard.

MACDUFF

    Hum! I guess at it.

ROSS

    Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
    Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
    Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
    To add the death of you.

MALCOLM

    Merciful heaven!
    What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
    Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
    Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.

MACDUFF

    My children too?

ROSS

    Wife, children, servants, all
    That could be found.

MACDUFF

    And I must be from thence!
    My wife kill'd too?

ROSS

    I have said.

MALCOLM

    Be comforted:
    Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
    To cure this deadly grief.

MACDUFF

    He has no children. All my pretty ones?
    Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
    What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
    At one fell swoop?

MALCOLM

    Dispute it like a man.

MACDUFF

    I shall do so;
    But I must also feel it as a man:
    I cannot but remember such things were,
    That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
    And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
    They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
    Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
    Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!

MALCOLM

    Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
    Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.

MACDUFF

    O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
    And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
    Cut short all intermission; front to front
    Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
    Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
    Heaven forgive him too!

MALCOLM

    This tune goes manly.
    Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
    Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
    Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
    Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
    The night is long that never finds the day.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.

    Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman

Doctor

    I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
    no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?

Gentlewoman

    Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
    her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
    her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
    write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
    return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.

Doctor

    A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
    the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
    watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
    walking and other actual performances, what, at any
    time, have you heard her say?

Gentlewoman

    That, sir, which I will not report after her.

Doctor

    You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.

Gentlewoman

    Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
    confirm my speech.

    Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper
    Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;
    and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.

Doctor

    How came she by that light?

Gentlewoman

    Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
    continually; 'tis her command.

Doctor

    You see, her eyes are open.

Gentlewoman

    Ay, but their sense is shut.

Doctor

    What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.

Gentlewoman

    It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
    washing her hands: I have known her continue in
    this a quarter of an hour.

LADY MACBETH

    Yet here's a spot.

Doctor

    Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
    her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.

LADY MACBETH

    Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,
    then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my
    lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
    fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
    account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
    to have had so much blood in him.

Doctor

    Do you mark that?

LADY MACBETH

    The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
    What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'
    that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
    this starting.

Doctor

    Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.

Gentlewoman

    She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
    that: heaven knows what she has known.

LADY MACBETH

    Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
    perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
    hand. Oh, oh, oh!

Doctor

    What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.

Gentlewoman

    I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
    dignity of the whole body.

Doctor

    Well, well, well,--

Gentlewoman

    Pray God it be, sir.

Doctor

    This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
    those which have walked in their sleep who have died
    holily in their beds.

LADY MACBETH

    Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
    pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he
    cannot come out on's grave.

Doctor

    Even so?

LADY MACBETH

    To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
    come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
    done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!

    Exit

Doctor

    Will she go now to bed?

Gentlewoman

    Directly.

Doctor

    Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
    Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
    To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
    More needs she the divine than the physician.
    God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
    Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
    And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
    My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
    I think, but dare not speak.

Gentlewoman

    Good night, good doctor.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The country near Dunsinane.

    Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, and Soldiers

MENTEITH

    The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
    His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
    Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
    Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
    Excite the mortified man.

ANGUS

    Near Birnam wood
    Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.

CAITHNESS

    Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?

LENNOX

    For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
    Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
    And many unrough youths that even now
    Protest their first of manhood.

MENTEITH

    What does the tyrant?

CAITHNESS

    Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
    Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
    Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
    He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
    Within the belt of rule.

ANGUS

    Now does he feel
    His secret murders sticking on his hands;
    Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
    Those he commands move only in command,
    Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
    Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
    Upon a dwarfish thief.

MENTEITH

    Who then shall blame
    His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
    When all that is within him does condemn
    Itself for being there?

CAITHNESS

    Well, march we on,
    To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:
    Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
    And with him pour we in our country's purge
    Each drop of us.

LENNOX

    Or so much as it needs,
    To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
    Make we our march towards Birnam.

    Exeunt, marching

SCENE III. Dunsinane. A room in the castle.

    Enter MACBETH, Doctor, and Attendants

MACBETH

    Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
    Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
    I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
    Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
    All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
    'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
    Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,
    false thanes,
    And mingle with the English epicures:
    The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
    Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.

    Enter a Servant
    The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
    Where got'st thou that goose look?

Servant

    There is ten thousand--

MACBETH

    Geese, villain!

Servant

    Soldiers, sir.

MACBETH

    Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
    Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
    Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
    Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?

Servant

    The English force, so please you.

MACBETH

    Take thy face hence.

    Exit Servant
    Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
    When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
    Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
    I have lived long enough: my way of life
    Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
    And that which should accompany old age,
    As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
    I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
    Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
    Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!

    Enter SEYTON

SEYTON

    What is your gracious pleasure?

MACBETH

    What news more?

SEYTON

    All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.

MACBETH

    I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
    Give me my armour.

SEYTON

    'Tis not needed yet.

MACBETH

    I'll put it on.
    Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
    Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
    How does your patient, doctor?

Doctor

    Not so sick, my lord,
    As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
    That keep her from her rest.

MACBETH

    Cure her of that.
    Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
    Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
    Raze out the written troubles of the brain
    And with some sweet oblivious antidote
    Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
    Which weighs upon the heart?

Doctor

    Therein the patient
    Must minister to himself.

MACBETH

    Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
    Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
    Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
    Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
    The water of my land, find her disease,
    And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
    I would applaud thee to the very echo,
    That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--
    What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
    Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?

Doctor

    Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
    Makes us hear something.

MACBETH

    Bring it after me.
    I will not be afraid of death and bane,
    Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.

Doctor

    [Aside] Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
    Profit again should hardly draw me here.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Country near Birnam wood.

    Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD and YOUNG SIWARD, MACDUFF, MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS, LENNOX, ROSS, and Soldiers, marching

MALCOLM

    Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
    That chambers will be safe.

MENTEITH

    We doubt it nothing.

SIWARD

    What wood is this before us?

MENTEITH

    The wood of Birnam.

MALCOLM

    Let every soldier hew him down a bough
    And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
    The numbers of our host and make discovery
    Err in report of us.

Soldiers

    It shall be done.

SIWARD

    We learn no other but the confident tyrant
    Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
    Our setting down before 't.

MALCOLM

    'Tis his main hope:
    For where there is advantage to be given,
    Both more and less have given him the revolt,
    And none serve with him but constrained things
    Whose hearts are absent too.

MACDUFF

    Let our just censures
    Attend the true event, and put we on
    Industrious soldiership.

SIWARD

    The time approaches
    That will with due decision make us know
    What we shall say we have and what we owe.
    Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
    But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
    Towards which advance the war.

    Exeunt, marching

SCENE V. Dunsinane. Within the castle.

    Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum and colours

MACBETH

    Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
    The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
    Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
    Till famine and the ague eat them up:
    Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
    We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
    And beat them backward home.

    A cry of women within
    What is that noise?

SEYTON

    It is the cry of women, my good lord.

    Exit

MACBETH

    I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
    The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
    To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
    Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
    As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
    Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
    Cannot once start me.

    Re-enter SEYTON
    Wherefore was that cry?

SEYTON

    The queen, my lord, is dead.

MACBETH

    She should have died hereafter;
    There would have been a time for such a word.
    To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
    Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
    To the last syllable of recorded time,
    And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
    The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
    Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
    That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
    And then is heard no more: it is a tale
    Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
    Signifying nothing.

    Enter a Messenger
    Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.

Messenger

    Gracious my lord,
    I should report that which I say I saw,
    But know not how to do it.

MACBETH

    Well, say, sir.

Messenger

    As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
    I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
    The wood began to move.

MACBETH

    Liar and slave!

Messenger

    Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
    Within this three mile may you see it coming;
    I say, a moving grove.

MACBETH

    If thou speak'st false,
    Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
    Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
    I care not if thou dost for me as much.
    I pull in resolution, and begin
    To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
    That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
    Do come to Dunsinane:' and now a wood
    Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
    If this which he avouches does appear,
    There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
    I gin to be aweary of the sun,
    And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
    Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
    At least we'll die with harness on our back.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Dunsinane. Before the castle.

    Drum and colours. Enter MALCOLM, SIWARD, MACDUFF, and their Army, with boughs

MALCOLM

    Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
    And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
    Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
    Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
    Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
    According to our order.

SIWARD

    Fare you well.
    Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,
    Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.

MACDUFF

    Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,
    Those clamorous harbingers of blood and death.

    Exeunt

SCENE VII. Another part of the field.

    Alarums. Enter MACBETH

MACBETH

    They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
    But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
    That was not born of woman? Such a one
    Am I to fear, or none.

    Enter YOUNG SIWARD

YOUNG SIWARD

    What is thy name?

MACBETH

    Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.

YOUNG SIWARD

    No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
    Than any is in hell.

MACBETH

    My name's Macbeth.

YOUNG SIWARD

    The devil himself could not pronounce a title
    More hateful to mine ear.

MACBETH

    No, nor more fearful.

YOUNG SIWARD

    Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
    I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.

    They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain

MACBETH

    Thou wast born of woman
    But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
    Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.

    Exit

    Alarums. Enter MACDUFF

MACDUFF

    That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
    If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
    My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
    I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
    Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
    Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
    I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
    By this great clatter, one of greatest note
    Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
    And more I beg not.

    Exit. Alarums

    Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD

SIWARD

    This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:
    The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
    The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
    The day almost itself professes yours,
    And little is to do.

MALCOLM

    We have met with foes
    That strike beside us.

SIWARD

    Enter, sir, the castle.

    Exeunt. Alarums

SCENE VIII. Another part of the field.

    Enter MACBETH

MACBETH

    Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
    On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
    Do better upon them.

    Enter MACDUFF

MACDUFF

    Turn, hell-hound, turn!

MACBETH

    Of all men else I have avoided thee:
    But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
    With blood of thine already.

MACDUFF

    I have no words:
    My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
    Than terms can give thee out!

    They fight

MACBETH

    Thou losest labour:
    As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
    With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
    Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
    I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
    To one of woman born.

MACDUFF

    Despair thy charm;
    And let the angel whom thou still hast served
    Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
    Untimely ripp'd.

MACBETH

    Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
    For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
    And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
    That palter with us in a double sense;
    That keep the word of promise to our ear,
    And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.

MACDUFF

    Then yield thee, coward,
    And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
    We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
    Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
    'Here may you see the tyrant.'

MACBETH

    I will not yield,
    To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
    And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
    Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
    And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
    Yet I will try the last. Before my body
    I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
    And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'

    Exeunt, fighting. Alarums

    Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours, MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers

MALCOLM

    I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.

SIWARD

    Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,
    So great a day as this is cheaply bought.

MALCOLM

    Macduff is missing, and your noble son.

ROSS

    Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
    He only lived but till he was a man;
    The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
    In the unshrinking station where he fought,
    But like a man he died.

SIWARD

    Then he is dead?

ROSS

    Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
    Must not be measured by his worth, for then
    It hath no end.

SIWARD

    Had he his hurts before?

ROSS

    Ay, on the front.

SIWARD

    Why then, God's soldier be he!
    Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
    I would not wish them to a fairer death:
    And so, his knell is knoll'd.

MALCOLM

    He's worth more sorrow,
    And that I'll spend for him.

SIWARD

    He's worth no more
    They say he parted well, and paid his score:
    And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.

    Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head

MACDUFF

    Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
    The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
    I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
    That speak my salutation in their minds;
    Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
    Hail, King of Scotland!

ALL

    Hail, King of Scotland!

    Flourish

MALCOLM

    We shall not spend a large expense of time
    Before we reckon with your several loves,
    And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
    Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
    In such an honour named. What's more to do,
    Which would be planted newly with the time,
    As calling home our exiled friends abroad
    That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
    Producing forth the cruel ministers
    Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
    Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
    Took off her life; this, and what needful else
    That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
    We will perform in measure, time and place:
    So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
    Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.

    Flourish. Exeunt


Othello, the Moore of Venice

ACT I
SCENE I. Venice. A street.

    Enter RODERIGO and IAGO

RODERIGO

    Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
    That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
    As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.

IAGO

    'Sblood, but you will not hear me:
    If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.

RODERIGO

    Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.

IAGO

    Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
    In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
    Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
    I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
    But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
    Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
    Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
    And, in conclusion,
    Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
    'I have already chose my officer.'
    And what was he?
    Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
    One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
    A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
    That never set a squadron in the field,
    Nor the division of a battle knows
    More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
    Wherein the toged consuls can propose
    As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
    Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
    And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
    At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
    Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
    By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
    He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
    And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.

RODERIGO

    By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.

IAGO

    Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
    Preferment goes by letter and affection,
    And not by old gradation, where each second
    Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
    Whether I in any just term am affined
    To love the Moor.

RODERIGO

    I would not follow him then.

IAGO

    O, sir, content you;
    I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
    We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
    Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
    Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
    That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
    Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
    For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
    Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
    Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
    Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
    And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
    Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
    their coats
    Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
    And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
    It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
    Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
    In following him, I follow but myself;
    Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
    But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
    For when my outward action doth demonstrate
    The native act and figure of my heart
    In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
    But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
    For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

RODERIGO

    What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
    If he can carry't thus!

IAGO

    Call up her father,
    Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
    Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
    And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
    Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
    Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,
    As it may lose some colour.

RODERIGO

    Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.

IAGO

    Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
    As when, by night and negligence, the fire
    Is spied in populous cities.

RODERIGO

    What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!

IAGO

    Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
    Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
    Thieves! thieves!

    BRABANTIO appears above, at a window

BRABANTIO

    What is the reason of this terrible summons?
    What is the matter there?

RODERIGO

    Signior, is all your family within?

IAGO

    Are your doors lock'd?

BRABANTIO

    Why, wherefore ask you this?

IAGO

    'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on
    your gown;
    Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
    Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
    Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
    Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
    Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
    Arise, I say.

BRABANTIO

    What, have you lost your wits?

RODERIGO

    Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?

BRABANTIO

    Not I what are you?

RODERIGO

    My name is Roderigo.

BRABANTIO

    The worser welcome:
    I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
    In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
    My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
    Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
    Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
    To start my quiet.

RODERIGO

    Sir, sir, sir,--

BRABANTIO

    But thou must needs be sure
    My spirit and my place have in them power
    To make this bitter to thee.

RODERIGO

    Patience, good sir.

BRABANTIO

    What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
    My house is not a grange.

RODERIGO

    Most grave Brabantio,
    In simple and pure soul I come to you.

IAGO

    'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
    serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to
    do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll
    have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
    you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
    coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.

BRABANTIO

    What profane wretch art thou?

IAGO

    I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter
    and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.

BRABANTIO

    Thou art a villain.

IAGO

    You are--a senator.

BRABANTIO

    This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.

RODERIGO

    Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
    If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
    As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
    At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
    Transported, with no worse nor better guard
    But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
    To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--
    If this be known to you and your allowance,
    We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
    But if you know not this, my manners tell me
    We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
    That, from the sense of all civility,
    I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
    Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
    I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
    Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
    In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
    Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
    If she be in her chamber or your house,
    Let loose on me the justice of the state
    For thus deluding you.

BRABANTIO

    Strike on the tinder, ho!
    Give me a taper! call up all my people!
    This accident is not unlike my dream:
    Belief of it oppresses me already.
    Light, I say! light!

    Exit above

IAGO

    Farewell; for I must leave you:
    It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
    To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--
    Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
    However this may gall him with some cheque,
    Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
    With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
    Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
    Another of his fathom they have none,
    To lead their business: in which regard,
    Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
    Yet, for necessity of present life,
    I must show out a flag and sign of love,
    Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
    Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
    And there will I be with him. So, farewell.

    Exit

    Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches

BRABANTIO

    It is too true an evil: gone she is;
    And what's to come of my despised time
    Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
    Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
    With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
    How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
    Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
    Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?

RODERIGO

    Truly, I think they are.

BRABANTIO

    O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
    Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
    By what you see them act. Is there not charms
    By which the property of youth and maidhood
    May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
    Of some such thing?

RODERIGO

    Yes, sir, I have indeed.

BRABANTIO

    Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
    Some one way, some another. Do you know
    Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?

RODERIGO

    I think I can discover him, if you please,
    To get good guard and go along with me.

BRABANTIO

    Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
    I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
    And raise some special officers of night.
    On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Another street.

    Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches

IAGO

    Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
    Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
    To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
    Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
    I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.

OTHELLO

    'Tis better as it is.

IAGO

    Nay, but he prated,
    And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
    Against your honour
    That, with the little godliness I have,
    I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
    Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
    That the magnifico is much beloved,
    And hath in his effect a voice potential
    As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
    Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
    The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
    Will give him cable.

OTHELLO

    Let him do his spite:
    My services which I have done the signiory
    Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--
    Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
    I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being
    From men of royal siege, and my demerits
    May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
    As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
    But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
    I would not my unhoused free condition
    Put into circumscription and confine
    For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?

IAGO

    Those are the raised father and his friends:
    You were best go in.

OTHELLO

    Not I I must be found:
    My parts, my title and my perfect soul
    Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?

IAGO

    By Janus, I think no.

    Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches

OTHELLO

    The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.
    The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
    What is the news?

CASSIO

    The duke does greet you, general,
    And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
    Even on the instant.

OTHELLO

    What is the matter, think you?

CASSIO

    Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
    It is a business of some heat: the galleys
    Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
    This very night at one another's heels,
    And many of the consuls, raised and met,
    Are at the duke's already: you have been
    hotly call'd for;
    When, being not at your lodging to be found,
    The senate hath sent about three several guests
    To search you out.

OTHELLO

    'Tis well I am found by you.
    I will but spend a word here in the house,
    And go with you.

    Exit

CASSIO

    Ancient, what makes he here?

IAGO

    'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
    If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.

CASSIO

    I do not understand.

IAGO

    He's married.

CASSIO

    To who?

    Re-enter OTHELLO

IAGO

    Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?

OTHELLO

    Have with you.

CASSIO

    Here comes another troop to seek for you.

IAGO

    It is Brabantio. General, be advised;
    He comes to bad intent.

    Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with torches and weapons

OTHELLO

    Holla! stand there!

RODERIGO

    Signior, it is the Moor.

BRABANTIO

    Down with him, thief!

    They draw on both sides

IAGO

    You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.

OTHELLO

    Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
    Good signior, you shall more command with years
    Than with your weapons.

BRABANTIO

    O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
    Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
    For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
    If she in chains of magic were not bound,
    Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
    So opposite to marriage that she shunned
    The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
    Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
    Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
    Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
    Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
    That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
    Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
    That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
    'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
    I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
    For an abuser of the world, a practiser
    Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
    Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
    Subdue him at his peril.

OTHELLO

    Hold your hands,
    Both you of my inclining, and the rest:
    Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
    Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
    To answer this your charge?

BRABANTIO

    To prison, till fit time
    Of law and course of direct session
    Call thee to answer.

OTHELLO

    What if I do obey?
    How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
    Whose messengers are here about my side,
    Upon some present business of the state
    To bring me to him?

First Officer

    'Tis true, most worthy signior;
    The duke's in council and your noble self,
    I am sure, is sent for.

BRABANTIO

    How! the duke in council!
    In this time of the night! Bring him away:
    Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
    Or any of my brothers of the state,
    Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
    For if such actions may have passage free,
    Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A council-chamber.

    The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers attending

DUKE OF VENICE

    There is no composition in these news
    That gives them credit.

First Senator

    Indeed, they are disproportion'd;
    My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.

DUKE OF VENICE

    And mine, a hundred and forty.

Second Senator

    And mine, two hundred:
    But though they jump not on a just account,--
    As in these cases, where the aim reports,
    'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm
    A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:
    I do not so secure me in the error,
    But the main article I do approve
    In fearful sense.

Sailor

    [Within] What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!

First Officer

    A messenger from the galleys.

    Enter a Sailor

DUKE OF VENICE

    Now, what's the business?

Sailor

    The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
    So was I bid report here to the state
    By Signior Angelo.

DUKE OF VENICE

    How say you by this change?

First Senator

    This cannot be,
    By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,
    To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
    The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
    And let ourselves again but understand,
    That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
    So may he with more facile question bear it,
    For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
    But altogether lacks the abilities
    That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,
    We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
    To leave that latest which concerns him first,
    Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
    To wake and wage a danger profitless.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.

First Officer

    Here is more news.

    Enter a Messenger

Messenger

    The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
    Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,
    Have there injointed them with an after fleet.

First Senator

    Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?

Messenger

    Of thirty sail: and now they do restem
    Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
    Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
    Your trusty and most valiant servitor,
    With his free duty recommends you thus,
    And prays you to believe him.

DUKE OF VENICE

    'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.
    Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?

First Senator

    He's now in Florence.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.

First Senator

    Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.

    Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers

DUKE OF VENICE

    Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
    Against the general enemy Ottoman.

    To BRABANTIO
    I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;
    We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.

BRABANTIO

    So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
    Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
    Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
    Take hold on me, for my particular grief
    Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
    That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
    And it is still itself.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Why, what's the matter?

BRABANTIO

    My daughter! O, my daughter!

DUKE OF VENICE Senator

    Dead?

BRABANTIO

    Ay, to me;
    She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
    By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
    For nature so preposterously to err,
    Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
    Sans witchcraft could not.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
    Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
    And you of her, the bloody book of law
    You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
    After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
    Stood in your action.

BRABANTIO

    Humbly I thank your grace.
    Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
    Your special mandate for the state-affairs
    Hath hither brought.

DUKE OF VENICE Senator

    We are very sorry for't.

DUKE OF VENICE

    [To OTHELLO] What, in your own part, can you say to this?

BRABANTIO

    Nothing, but this is so.

OTHELLO

    Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
    My very noble and approved good masters,
    That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
    It is most true; true, I have married her:
    The very head and front of my offending
    Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
    And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
    For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
    Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
    Their dearest action in the tented field,
    And little of this great world can I speak,
    More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
    And therefore little shall I grace my cause
    In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
    I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
    Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
    What conjuration and what mighty magic,
    For such proceeding I am charged withal,
    I won his daughter.

BRABANTIO

    A maiden never bold;
    Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
    Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
    Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
    To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
    It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
    That will confess perfection so could err
    Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
    To find out practises of cunning hell,
    Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
    That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
    Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
    He wrought upon her.

DUKE OF VENICE

    To vouch this, is no proof,
    Without more wider and more overt test
    Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
    Of modern seeming do prefer against him.

First Senator

    But, Othello, speak:
    Did you by indirect and forced courses
    Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
    Or came it by request and such fair question
    As soul to soul affordeth?

OTHELLO

    I do beseech you,
    Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
    And let her speak of me before her father:
    If you do find me foul in her report,
    The trust, the office I do hold of you,
    Not only take away, but let your sentence
    Even fall upon my life.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Fetch Desdemona hither.

OTHELLO

    Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.

    Exeunt IAGO and Attendants
    And, till she come, as truly as to heaven
    I do confess the vices of my blood,
    So justly to your grave ears I'll present
    How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
    And she in mine.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Say it, Othello.

OTHELLO

    Her father loved me; oft invited me;
    Still question'd me the story of my life,
    From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
    That I have passed.
    I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
    To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
    Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
    Of moving accidents by flood and field
    Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
    Of being taken by the insolent foe
    And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
    And portance in my travels' history:
    Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
    Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
    It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
    And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
    The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
    Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
    Would Desdemona seriously incline:
    But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
    Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
    She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
    Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
    Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
    To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
    That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
    Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
    But not intentively: I did consent,
    And often did beguile her of her tears,
    When I did speak of some distressful stroke
    That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
    She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
    She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
    'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
    She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
    That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
    And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
    I should but teach him how to tell my story.
    And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
    She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
    And I loved her that she did pity them.
    This only is the witchcraft I have used:
    Here comes the lady; let her witness it.

    Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants

DUKE OF VENICE

    I think this tale would win my daughter too.
    Good Brabantio,
    Take up this mangled matter at the best:
    Men do their broken weapons rather use
    Than their bare hands.

BRABANTIO

    I pray you, hear her speak:
    If she confess that she was half the wooer,
    Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
    Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
    Do you perceive in all this noble company
    Where most you owe obedience?

DESDEMONA

    My noble father,
    I do perceive here a divided duty:
    To you I am bound for life and education;
    My life and education both do learn me
    How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
    I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
    And so much duty as my mother show'd
    To you, preferring you before her father,
    So much I challenge that I may profess
    Due to the Moor my lord.

BRABANTIO

    God be wi' you! I have done.
    Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
    I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
    Come hither, Moor:
    I here do give thee that with all my heart
    Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
    I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
    I am glad at soul I have no other child:
    For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
    To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
    Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
    Into your favour.
    When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
    By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
    To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
    Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
    What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
    Patience her injury a mockery makes.
    The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
    He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.

BRABANTIO

    So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
    We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
    He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
    But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
    But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
    That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
    These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
    Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
    But words are words; I never yet did hear
    That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
    I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.

DUKE OF VENICE

    The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
    Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
    known to you; and though we have there a substitute
    of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a
    sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
    voice on you: you must therefore be content to
    slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
    more stubborn and boisterous expedition.

OTHELLO

    The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
    Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
    My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise
    A natural and prompt alacrity
    I find in hardness, and do undertake
    These present wars against the Ottomites.
    Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
    I crave fit disposition for my wife.
    Due reference of place and exhibition,
    With such accommodation and besort
    As levels with her breeding.

DUKE OF VENICE

    If you please,
    Be't at her father's.

BRABANTIO

    I'll not have it so.

OTHELLO

    Nor I.

DESDEMONA

    Nor I; I would not there reside,
    To put my father in impatient thoughts
    By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
    To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
    And let me find a charter in your voice,
    To assist my simpleness.

DUKE OF VENICE

    What would You, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA

    That I did love the Moor to live with him,
    My downright violence and storm of fortunes
    May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
    Even to the very quality of my lord:
    I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
    And to his honour and his valiant parts
    Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
    So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
    A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
    The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
    And I a heavy interim shall support
    By his dear absence. Let me go with him.

OTHELLO

    Let her have your voices.
    Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,
    To please the palate of my appetite,
    Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
    In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.
    But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
    And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
    I will your serious and great business scant
    For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys
    Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
    My speculative and officed instruments,
    That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
    Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
    And all indign and base adversities
    Make head against my estimation!

DUKE OF VENICE

    Be it as you shall privately determine,
    Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,
    And speed must answer it.

First Senator

    You must away to-night.

OTHELLO

    With all my heart.

DUKE OF VENICE

    At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
    Othello, leave some officer behind,
    And he shall our commission bring to you;
    With such things else of quality and respect
    As doth import you.

OTHELLO

    So please your grace, my ancient;
    A man he is of honest and trust:
    To his conveyance I assign my wife,
    With what else needful your good grace shall think
    To be sent after me.

DUKE OF VENICE

    Let it be so.
    Good night to every one.

    To BRABANTIO
    And, noble signior,
    If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
    Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.

First Senator

    Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.

BRABANTIO

    Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
    She has deceived her father, and may thee.

    Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers, & c

OTHELLO

    My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
    My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
    I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:
    And bring them after in the best advantage.
    Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour
    Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
    To spend with thee: we must obey the time.

    Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA

RODERIGO

    Iago,--

IAGO

    What say'st thou, noble heart?

RODERIGO

    What will I do, thinkest thou?

IAGO

    Why, go to bed, and sleep.

RODERIGO

    I will incontinently drown myself.

IAGO

    If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,
    thou silly gentleman!

RODERIGO

    It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and
    then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.

IAGO

    O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four
    times seven years; and since I could distinguish
    betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
    that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I
    would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I
    would change my humanity with a baboon.

RODERIGO

    What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so
    fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.

IAGO

    Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
    or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
    our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
    nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up
    thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
    distract it with many, either to have it sterile
    with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
    power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
    wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
    scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
    blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
    to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
    reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
    stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
    you call love to be a sect or scion.

RODERIGO

    It cannot be.

IAGO

    It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
    the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
    cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
    friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
    cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
    better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
    purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
    an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It
    cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
    love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he
    his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
    shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but
    money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
    their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
    that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
    to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
    change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
    she will find the error of her choice: she must
    have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
    purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
    more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
    thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
    an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
    too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
    shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
    drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
    thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
    to be drowned and go without her.

RODERIGO

    Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
    the issue?

IAGO

    Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told
    thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
    hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
    less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
    against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
    thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
    events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
    Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more
    of this to-morrow. Adieu.

RODERIGO

    Where shall we meet i' the morning?

IAGO

    At my lodging.

RODERIGO

    I'll be with thee betimes.

IAGO

    Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?

RODERIGO

    What say you?

IAGO

    No more of drowning, do you hear?

RODERIGO

    I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.

    Exit

IAGO

    Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:
    For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
    If I would time expend with such a snipe.
    But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
    And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
    He has done my office: I know not if't be true;
    But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
    Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
    The better shall my purpose work on him.
    Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
    To get his place and to plume up my will
    In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--
    After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
    That he is too familiar with his wife.
    He hath a person and a smooth dispose
    To be suspected, framed to make women false.
    The Moor is of a free and open nature,
    That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
    And will as tenderly be led by the nose
    As asses are.
    I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
    Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.

    Exit

ACT II
SCENE I. A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.

    Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen

MONTANO

    What from the cape can you discern at sea?

First Gentleman

    Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
    I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
    Descry a sail.

MONTANO

    Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
    A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
    If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
    What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
    Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?

Second Gentleman

    A segregation of the Turkish fleet:
    For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
    The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
    The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
    seems to cast water on the burning bear,
    And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:
    I never did like molestation view
    On the enchafed flood.

MONTANO

    If that the Turkish fleet
    Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:
    It is impossible they bear it out.

    Enter a third Gentleman

Third Gentleman

    News, lads! our wars are done.
    The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,
    That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice
    Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
    On most part of their fleet.

MONTANO

    How! is this true?

Third Gentleman

    The ship is here put in,
    A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
    Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,
    Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,
    And is in full commission here for Cyprus.

MONTANO

    I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.

Third Gentleman

    But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
    Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,
    And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
    With foul and violent tempest.

MONTANO

    Pray heavens he be;
    For I have served him, and the man commands
    Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!
    As well to see the vessel that's come in
    As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
    Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
    An indistinct regard.

Third Gentleman

    Come, let's do so:
    For every minute is expectancy
    Of more arrivance.

    Enter CASSIO

CASSIO

    Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
    That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
    Give him defence against the elements,
    For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.

MONTANO

    Is he well shipp'd?

CASSIO

    His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot
    Of very expert and approved allowance;
    Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
    Stand in bold cure.

    A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!'

    Enter a fourth Gentleman

CASSIO

    What noise?

Fourth Gentleman

    The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
    Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'

CASSIO

    My hopes do shape him for the governor.

    Guns heard

Second Gentlemen

    They do discharge their shot of courtesy:
    Our friends at least.

CASSIO

    I pray you, sir, go forth,
    And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.

Second Gentleman

    I shall.

    Exit

MONTANO

    But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?

CASSIO

    Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
    That paragons description and wild fame;
    One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
    And in the essential vesture of creation
    Does tire the ingener.

    Re-enter second Gentleman
    How now! who has put in?

Second Gentleman

    'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.

CASSIO

    Has had most favourable and happy speed:
    Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
    The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--
    Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--
    As having sense of beauty, do omit
    Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
    The divine Desdemona.

MONTANO

    What is she?

CASSIO

    She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
    Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
    Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
    A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
    And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
    That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
    Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
    Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
    And bring all Cyprus comfort!

    Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Attendants
    O, behold,
    The riches of the ship is come on shore!
    Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
    Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
    Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
    Enwheel thee round!

DESDEMONA

    I thank you, valiant Cassio.
    What tidings can you tell me of my lord?

CASSIO

    He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
    But that he's well and will be shortly here.

DESDEMONA

    O, but I fear--How lost you company?

CASSIO

    The great contention of the sea and skies
    Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.

    Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard

Second Gentleman

    They give their greeting to the citadel;
    This likewise is a friend.

CASSIO

    See for the news.

    Exit Gentleman
    Good ancient, you are welcome.

    To EMILIA
    Welcome, mistress.
    Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
    That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
    That gives me this bold show of courtesy.

    Kissing her

IAGO

    Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
    As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
    You'll have enough.

DESDEMONA

    Alas, she has no speech.

IAGO

    In faith, too much;
    I find it still, when I have list to sleep:
    Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
    She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
    And chides with thinking.

EMILIA

    You have little cause to say so.

IAGO

    Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,
    Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,
    Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,
    Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.

DESDEMONA

    O, fie upon thee, slanderer!

IAGO

    Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
    You rise to play and go to bed to work.

EMILIA

    You shall not write my praise.

IAGO

    No, let me not.

DESDEMONA

    What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
    praise me?

IAGO

    O gentle lady, do not put me to't;
    For I am nothing, if not critical.

DESDEMONA

    Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?

IAGO

    Ay, madam.

DESDEMONA

    I am not merry; but I do beguile
    The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
    Come, how wouldst thou praise me?

IAGO

    I am about it; but indeed my invention
    Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;
    It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,
    And thus she is deliver'd.
    If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
    The one's for use, the other useth it.

DESDEMONA

    Well praised! How if she be black and witty?

IAGO

    If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
    She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.

DESDEMONA

    Worse and worse.

EMILIA

    How if fair and foolish?

IAGO

    She never yet was foolish that was fair;
    For even her folly help'd her to an heir.

DESDEMONA

    These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
    the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
    her that's foul and foolish?

IAGO

    There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
    But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.

DESDEMONA

    O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.
    But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
    woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
    merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?

IAGO

    She that was ever fair and never proud,
    Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
    Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
    Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'
    She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
    Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
    She that in wisdom never was so frail
    To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
    She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
    See suitors following and not look behind,
    She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--

DESDEMONA

    To do what?

IAGO

    To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.

DESDEMONA

    O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn
    of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say
    you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal
    counsellor?

CASSIO

    He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in
    the soldier than in the scholar.

IAGO

    [Aside] He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,
    whisper: with as little a web as this will I
    ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
    her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.
    You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as
    these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had
    been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
    oft, which now again you are most apt to play the
    sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent
    courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers
    to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!

    Trumpet within
    The Moor! I know his trumpet.

CASSIO

    'Tis truly so.

DESDEMONA

    Let's meet him and receive him.

CASSIO

    Lo, where he comes!

    Enter OTHELLO and Attendants

OTHELLO

    O my fair warrior!

DESDEMONA

    My dear Othello!

OTHELLO

    It gives me wonder great as my content
    To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
    If after every tempest come such calms,
    May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
    And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
    Olympus-high and duck again as low
    As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
    'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,
    My soul hath her content so absolute
    That not another comfort like to this
    Succeeds in unknown fate.

DESDEMONA

    The heavens forbid
    But that our loves and comforts should increase,
    Even as our days do grow!

OTHELLO

    Amen to that, sweet powers!
    I cannot speak enough of this content;
    It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
    And this, and this, the greatest discords be

    Kissing her
    That e'er our hearts shall make!

IAGO

    [Aside] O, you are well tuned now!
    But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
    As honest as I am.

OTHELLO

    Come, let us to the castle.
    News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks
    are drown'd.
    How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
    Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
    I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
    I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
    In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
    Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
    Bring thou the master to the citadel;
    He is a good one, and his worthiness
    Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
    Once more, well met at Cyprus.

    Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants

IAGO

    Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
    hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base
    men being in love have then a nobility in their
    natures more than is native to them--list me. The
    lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
    guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is
    directly in love with him.

RODERIGO

    With him! why, 'tis not possible.

IAGO

    Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
    Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
    but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
    and will she love him still for prating? let not
    thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
    and what delight shall she have to look on the
    devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
    sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
    give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
    sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
    the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
    required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
    find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
    disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
    instruct her in it and compel her to some second
    choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most
    pregnant and unforced position--who stands so
    eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
    does? a knave very voluble; no further
    conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
    civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
    of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
    none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
    finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
    counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
    present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
    knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
    requisites in him that folly and green minds look
    after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
    hath found him already.

RODERIGO

    I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
    most blessed condition.

IAGO

    Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
    grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
    have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
    not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
    not mark that?

RODERIGO

    Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.

IAGO

    Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue
    to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
    so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
    together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
    mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
    the master and main exercise, the incorporate
    conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
    have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
    for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows
    you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
    some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
    too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
    other course you please, which the time shall more
    favourably minister.

RODERIGO

    Well.

IAGO

    Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply
    may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
    even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
    mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
    taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
    shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
    the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
    impediment most profitably removed, without the
    which there were no expectation of our prosperity.

RODERIGO

    I will do this, if I can bring it to any
    opportunity.

IAGO

    I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
    I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.

RODERIGO

    Adieu.

    Exit

IAGO

    That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
    That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
    The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
    Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
    And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
    A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
    Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
    I stand accountant for as great a sin,
    But partly led to diet my revenge,
    For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
    Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
    Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
    And nothing can or shall content my soul
    Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
    Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
    At least into a jealousy so strong
    That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
    If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
    For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
    I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
    Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--
    For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
    Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
    For making him egregiously an ass
    And practising upon his peace and quiet
    Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
    Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.

    Exit

SCENE II. A street.

    Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People following

Herald

    It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant
    general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,
    importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,
    every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,
    some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and
    revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these
    beneficial news, it is the celebration of his
    nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be
    proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full
    liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
    till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the
    isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A hall in the castle.

    Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants

OTHELLO

    Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:
    Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,
    Not to outsport discretion.

CASSIO

    Iago hath direction what to do;
    But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye
    Will I look to't.

OTHELLO

    Iago is most honest.
    Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest
    Let me have speech with you.

    To DESDEMONA
    Come, my dear love,
    The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
    That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
    Good night.

    Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants

    Enter IAGO

CASSIO

    Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.

IAGO

    Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the
    clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
    of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
    he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
    she is sport for Jove.

CASSIO

    She's a most exquisite lady.

IAGO

    And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.

CASSIO

    Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.

IAGO

    What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of
    provocation.

CASSIO

    An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.

IAGO

    And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?

CASSIO

    She is indeed perfection.

IAGO

    Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I
    have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
    of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
    the health of black Othello.

CASSIO

    Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
    unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
    courtesy would invent some other custom of
    entertainment.

IAGO

    O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for
    you.

CASSIO

    I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was
    craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation
    it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,
    and dare not task my weakness with any more.

IAGO

    What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants
    desire it.

CASSIO

    Where are they?

IAGO

    Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.

CASSIO

    I'll do't; but it dislikes me.

    Exit

IAGO

    If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
    With that which he hath drunk to-night already,
    He'll be as full of quarrel and offence
    As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,
    Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
    To Desdemona hath to-night caroused
    Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:
    Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
    That hold their honours in a wary distance,
    The very elements of this warlike isle,
    Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,
    And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
    Am I to put our Cassio in some action
    That may offend the isle.--But here they come:
    If consequence do but approve my dream,
    My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.

    Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen; servants following with wine

CASSIO

    'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.

MONTANO

    Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am
    a soldier.

IAGO

    Some wine, ho!

    Sings
    And let me the canakin clink, clink;
    And let me the canakin clink
    A soldier's a man;
    A life's but a span;
    Why, then, let a soldier drink.
    Some wine, boys!

CASSIO

    'Fore God, an excellent song.

IAGO

    I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are
    most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and
    your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing
    to your English.

CASSIO

    Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?

IAGO

    Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead
    drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he
    gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle
    can be filled.

CASSIO

    To the health of our general!

MONTANO

    I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.

IAGO

    O sweet England!
    King Stephen was a worthy peer,
    His breeches cost him but a crown;
    He held them sixpence all too dear,
    With that he call'd the tailor lown.
    He was a wight of high renown,
    And thou art but of low degree:
    'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
    Then take thine auld cloak about thee.
    Some wine, ho!

CASSIO

    Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.

IAGO

    Will you hear't again?

CASSIO

    No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
    does those things. Well, God's above all; and there
    be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.

IAGO

    It's true, good lieutenant.

CASSIO

    For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor
    any man of quality,--I hope to be saved.

IAGO

    And so do I too, lieutenant.

CASSIO

    Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the
    lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's
    have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive
    us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.
    Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my
    ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:
    I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and
    speak well enough.

All

    Excellent well.

CASSIO

    Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.

    Exit

MONTANO

    To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.

IAGO

    You see this fellow that is gone before;
    He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
    And give direction: and do but see his vice;
    'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
    The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.
    I fear the trust Othello puts him in.
    On some odd time of his infirmity,
    Will shake this island.

MONTANO

    But is he often thus?

IAGO

    'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:
    He'll watch the horologe a double set,
    If drink rock not his cradle.

MONTANO

    It were well
    The general were put in mind of it.
    Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature
    Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,
    And looks not on his evils: is not this true?

    Enter RODERIGO

IAGO

    [Aside to him] How now, Roderigo!
    I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.

    Exit RODERIGO

MONTANO

    And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
    Should hazard such a place as his own second
    With one of an ingraft infirmity:
    It were an honest action to say
    So to the Moor.

IAGO

    Not I, for this fair island:
    I do love Cassio well; and would do much
    To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?

    Cry within: 'Help! help!'

    Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO

CASSIO

    You rogue! you rascal!

MONTANO

    What's the matter, lieutenant?

CASSIO

    A knave teach me my duty!
    I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.

RODERIGO

    Beat me!

CASSIO

    Dost thou prate, rogue?

    Striking RODERIGO

MONTANO

    Nay, good lieutenant;

    Staying him
    I pray you, sir, hold your hand.

CASSIO

    Let me go, sir,
    Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.

MONTANO

    Come, come,
    you're drunk.

CASSIO

    Drunk!

    They fight

IAGO

    [Aside to RODERIGO] Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.

    Exit RODERIGO
    Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--
    Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;
    Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!

    Bell rings
    Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!
    The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!
    You will be shamed for ever.

    Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants

OTHELLO

    What is the matter here?

MONTANO

    'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.

    Faints

OTHELLO

    Hold, for your lives!

IAGO

    Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--
    Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
    Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!

OTHELLO

    Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?
    Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
    Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
    For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:
    He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
    Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
    Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
    From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
    Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
    Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.

IAGO

    I do not know: friends all but now, even now,
    In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
    Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--
    As if some planet had unwitted men--
    Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
    In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
    Any beginning to this peevish odds;
    And would in action glorious I had lost
    Those legs that brought me to a part of it!

OTHELLO

    How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?

CASSIO

    I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.

OTHELLO

    Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
    The gravity and stillness of your youth
    The world hath noted, and your name is great
    In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,
    That you unlace your reputation thus
    And spend your rich opinion for the name
    Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.

MONTANO

    Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:
    Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--
    While I spare speech, which something now
    offends me,--
    Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
    By me that's said or done amiss this night;
    Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
    And to defend ourselves it be a sin
    When violence assails us.

OTHELLO

    Now, by heaven,
    My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
    And passion, having my best judgment collied,
    Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,
    Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
    Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
    How this foul rout began, who set it on;
    And he that is approved in this offence,
    Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
    Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
    Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
    To manage private and domestic quarrel,
    In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
    'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?

MONTANO

    If partially affined, or leagued in office,
    Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
    Thou art no soldier.

IAGO

    Touch me not so near:
    I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
    Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
    Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
    Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
    Montano and myself being in speech,
    There comes a fellow crying out for help:
    And Cassio following him with determined sword,
    To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
    Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
    Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
    Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--
    The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
    Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather
    For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
    And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night
    I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
    For this was brief--I found them close together,
    At blow and thrust; even as again they were
    When you yourself did part them.
    More of this matter cannot I report:
    But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
    Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
    As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
    Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
    From him that fled some strange indignity,
    Which patience could not pass.

OTHELLO

    I know, Iago,
    Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
    Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee
    But never more be officer of mine.

    Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended
    Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
    I'll make thee an example.

DESDEMONA

    What's the matter?

OTHELLO

    All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
    Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:
    Lead him off.

    To MONTANO, who is led off
    Iago, look with care about the town,
    And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
    Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life
    To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.

    Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO

IAGO

    What, are you hurt, lieutenant?

CASSIO

    Ay, past all surgery.

IAGO

    Marry, heaven forbid!

CASSIO

    Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost
    my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
    myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
    Iago, my reputation!

IAGO

    As I am an honest man, I thought you had received
    some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
    in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
    imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
    deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
    unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!
    there are ways to recover the general again: you
    are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
    policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
    offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
    to him again, and he's yours.

CASSIO

    I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
    good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so
    indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
    and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
    fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible
    spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,
    let us call thee devil!

IAGO

    What was he that you followed with your sword? What
    had he done to you?

CASSIO

    I know not.

IAGO

    Is't possible?

CASSIO

    I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
    a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
    should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
    their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance
    revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!

IAGO

    Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
    recovered?

CASSIO

    It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
    to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
    another, to make me frankly despise myself.

IAGO

    Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,
    the place, and the condition of this country
    stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;
    but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.

CASSIO

    I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
    I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
    such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
    sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
    beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
    unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.

IAGO

    Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,
    if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
    And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.

CASSIO

    I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!

IAGO

    You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.
    I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
    is now the general: may say so in this respect, for
    that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
    contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and
    graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
    her help to put you in your place again: she is of
    so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
    she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
    than she is requested: this broken joint between
    you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my
    fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
    crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.

CASSIO

    You advise me well.

IAGO

    I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.

CASSIO

    I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
    beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
    I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.

IAGO

    You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I
    must to the watch.
    CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.

    Exit

IAGO

    And what's he then that says I play the villain?
    When this advice is free I give and honest,
    Probal to thinking and indeed the course
    To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
    The inclining Desdemona to subdue
    In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
    As the free elements. And then for her
    To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,
    All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
    His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
    That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
    Even as her appetite shall play the god
    With his weak function. How am I then a villain
    To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
    Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
    When devils will the blackest sins put on,
    They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
    As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
    Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
    And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
    I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
    That she repeals him for her body's lust;
    And by how much she strives to do him good,
    She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
    So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
    And out of her own goodness make the net
    That shall enmesh them all.

    Re-enter RODERIGO
    How now, Roderigo!

RODERIGO

    I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that
    hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
    almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
    cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall
    have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
    no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.

IAGO

    How poor are they that have not patience!
    What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
    Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;
    And wit depends on dilatory time.
    Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
    And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:
    Though other things grow fair against the sun,
    Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
    Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
    Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
    Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
    Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
    Nay, get thee gone.

    Exit RODERIGO
    Two things are to be done:
    My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
    I'll set her on;
    Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
    And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
    Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way
    Dull not device by coldness and delay.

    Exit

ACT III
SCENE I. Before the castle.

    Enter CASSIO and some Musicians

CASSIO

    Masters, play here; I will content your pains;
    Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'

    Music

    Enter Clown

Clown

    Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,
    that they speak i' the nose thus?

First Musician

    How, sir, how!

Clown

    Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?

First Musician

    Ay, marry, are they, sir.

Clown

    O, thereby hangs a tail.

First Musician

    Whereby hangs a tale, sir?

Clown

    Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.
    But, masters, here's money for you: and the general
    so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's
    sake, to make no more noise with it.

First Musician

    Well, sir, we will not.

Clown

    If you have any music that may not be heard, to't
    again: but, as they say to hear music the general
    does not greatly care.

First Musician

    We have none such, sir.

Clown

    Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:
    go; vanish into air; away!

    Exeunt Musicians

CASSIO

    Dost thou hear, my honest friend?

Clown

    No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.

CASSIO

    Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece
    of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
    the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's
    one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
    wilt thou do this?

Clown

    She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I
    shall seem to notify unto her.

CASSIO

    Do, good my friend.

    Exit Clown

    Enter IAGO
    In happy time, Iago.

IAGO

    You have not been a-bed, then?

CASSIO

    Why, no; the day had broke
    Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
    To send in to your wife: my suit to her
    Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
    Procure me some access.

IAGO

    I'll send her to you presently;
    And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
    Out of the way, that your converse and business
    May be more free.

CASSIO

    I humbly thank you for't.

    Exit IAGO
    I never knew
    A Florentine more kind and honest.

    Enter EMILIA

EMILIA

    Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry
    For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
    The general and his wife are talking of it;
    And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,
    That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
    And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
    He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
    And needs no other suitor but his likings
    To take the safest occasion by the front
    To bring you in again.

CASSIO

    Yet, I beseech you,
    If you think fit, or that it may be done,
    Give me advantage of some brief discourse
    With Desdemona alone.

EMILIA

    Pray you, come in;
    I will bestow you where you shall have time
    To speak your bosom freely.

CASSIO

    I am much bound to you.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the castle.

    Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen

OTHELLO

    These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;
    And by him do my duties to the senate:
    That done, I will be walking on the works;
    Repair there to me.

IAGO

    Well, my good lord, I'll do't.

OTHELLO

    This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?

Gentleman

    We'll wait upon your lordship.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The garden of the castle.

    Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA

DESDEMONA

    Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
    All my abilities in thy behalf.

EMILIA

    Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
    As if the case were his.

DESDEMONA

    O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
    But I will have my lord and you again
    As friendly as you were.

CASSIO

    Bounteous madam,
    Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
    He's never any thing but your true servant.

DESDEMONA

    I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
    You have known him long; and be you well assured
    He shall in strangeness stand no further off
    Than in a polite distance.

CASSIO

    Ay, but, lady,
    That policy may either last so long,
    Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
    Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
    That, I being absent and my place supplied,
    My general will forget my love and service.

DESDEMONA

    Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
    I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
    If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
    To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
    I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
    His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
    I'll intermingle every thing he does
    With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
    For thy solicitor shall rather die
    Than give thy cause away.

EMILIA

    Madam, here comes my lord.

CASSIO

    Madam, I'll take my leave.

DESDEMONA

    Why, stay, and hear me speak.

CASSIO

    Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
    Unfit for mine own purposes.

DESDEMONA

    Well, do your discretion.

    Exit CASSIO

    Enter OTHELLO and IAGO

IAGO

    Ha! I like not that.

OTHELLO

    What dost thou say?

IAGO

    Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.

OTHELLO

    Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?

IAGO

    Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
    That he would steal away so guilty-like,
    Seeing you coming.

OTHELLO

    I do believe 'twas he.

DESDEMONA

    How now, my lord!
    I have been talking with a suitor here,
    A man that languishes in your displeasure.

OTHELLO

    Who is't you mean?

DESDEMONA

    Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
    If I have any grace or power to move you,
    His present reconciliation take;
    For if he be not one that truly loves you,
    That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
    I have no judgment in an honest face:
    I prithee, call him back.

OTHELLO

    Went he hence now?

DESDEMONA

    Ay, sooth; so humbled
    That he hath left part of his grief with me,
    To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.

OTHELLO

    Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.

DESDEMONA

    But shall't be shortly?

OTHELLO

    The sooner, sweet, for you.

DESDEMONA

    Shall't be to-night at supper?

OTHELLO

    No, not to-night.

DESDEMONA

    To-morrow dinner, then?

OTHELLO

    I shall not dine at home;
    I meet the captains at the citadel.

DESDEMONA

    Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
    On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
    I prithee, name the time, but let it not
    Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
    And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
    Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
    Out of their best--is not almost a fault
    To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
    Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
    What you would ask me, that I should deny,
    Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
    That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
    When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
    Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
    To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--

OTHELLO

    Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
    I will deny thee nothing.

DESDEMONA

    Why, this is not a boon;
    'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
    Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
    Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
    To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
    Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
    It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
    And fearful to be granted.

OTHELLO

    I will deny thee nothing:
    Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
    To leave me but a little to myself.

DESDEMONA

    Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.

OTHELLO

    Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.

DESDEMONA

    Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
    Whate'er you be, I am obedient.

    Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA

OTHELLO

    Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
    But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
    Chaos is come again.

IAGO

    My noble lord--

OTHELLO

    What dost thou say, Iago?

IAGO

    Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
    Know of your love?

OTHELLO

    He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?

IAGO

    But for a satisfaction of my thought;
    No further harm.

OTHELLO

    Why of thy thought, Iago?

IAGO

    I did not think he had been acquainted with her.

OTHELLO

    O, yes; and went between us very oft.

IAGO

    Indeed!

OTHELLO

    Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
    Is he not honest?

IAGO

    Honest, my lord!

OTHELLO

    Honest! ay, honest.

IAGO

    My lord, for aught I know.

OTHELLO

    What dost thou think?

IAGO

    Think, my lord!

OTHELLO

    Think, my lord!
    By heaven, he echoes me,
    As if there were some monster in his thought
    Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
    I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
    When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
    And when I told thee he was of my counsel
    In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
    And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
    As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
    Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
    Show me thy thought.

IAGO

    My lord, you know I love you.

OTHELLO

    I think thou dost;
    And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
    And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
    Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
    For such things in a false disloyal knave
    Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
    They are close delations, working from the heart
    That passion cannot rule.

IAGO

    For Michael Cassio,
    I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.

OTHELLO

    I think so too.

IAGO

    Men should be what they seem;
    Or those that be not, would they might seem none!

OTHELLO

    Certain, men should be what they seem.

IAGO

    Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.

OTHELLO

    Nay, yet there's more in this:
    I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
    As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
    The worst of words.

IAGO

    Good my lord, pardon me:
    Though I am bound to every act of duty,
    I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
    Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
    As where's that palace whereinto foul things
    Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
    But some uncleanly apprehensions
    Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
    With meditations lawful?

OTHELLO

    Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
    If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
    A stranger to thy thoughts.

IAGO

    I do beseech you--
    Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
    As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
    To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
    Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
    From one that so imperfectly conceits,
    Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
    Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
    It were not for your quiet nor your good,
    Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
    To let you know my thoughts.

OTHELLO

    What dost thou mean?

IAGO

    Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
    Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
    Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
    'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
    But he that filches from me my good name
    Robs me of that which not enriches him
    And makes me poor indeed.

OTHELLO

    By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.

IAGO

    You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
    Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.

OTHELLO

    Ha!

IAGO

    O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
    It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
    The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
    Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
    But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
    Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!

OTHELLO

    O misery!

IAGO

    Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
    But riches fineless is as poor as winter
    To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
    Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
    From jealousy!

OTHELLO

    Why, why is this?
    Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
    To follow still the changes of the moon
    With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
    Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
    When I shall turn the business of my soul
    To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
    Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
    To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
    Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
    Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
    Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
    The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
    For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
    I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
    And on the proof, there is no more but this,--
    Away at once with love or jealousy!

IAGO

    I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
    To show the love and duty that I bear you
    With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
    Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
    Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
    Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
    I would not have your free and noble nature,
    Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
    I know our country disposition well;
    In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
    They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
    Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.

OTHELLO

    Dost thou say so?

IAGO

    She did deceive her father, marrying you;
    And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
    She loved them most.

OTHELLO

    And so she did.

IAGO

    Why, go to then;
    She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
    To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
    He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;
    I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
    For too much loving you.

OTHELLO

    I am bound to thee for ever.

IAGO

    I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.

OTHELLO

    Not a jot, not a jot.

IAGO

    I' faith, I fear it has.
    I hope you will consider what is spoke
    Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
    I am to pray you not to strain my speech
    To grosser issues nor to larger reach
    Than to suspicion.

OTHELLO

    I will not.

IAGO

    Should you do so, my lord,
    My speech should fall into such vile success
    As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--
    My lord, I see you're moved.

OTHELLO

    No, not much moved:
    I do not think but Desdemona's honest.

IAGO

    Long live she so! and long live you to think so!

OTHELLO

    And yet, how nature erring from itself,--

IAGO

    Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--
    Not to affect many proposed matches
    Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
    Whereto we see in all things nature tends--
    Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
    Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
    But pardon me; I do not in position
    Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
    Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
    May fall to match you with her country forms
    And happily repent.

OTHELLO

    Farewell, farewell:
    If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
    Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:

IAGO

    [Going] My lord, I take my leave.

OTHELLO

    Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
    Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.

IAGO

    [Returning] My lord, I would I might entreat
    your honour
    To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
    Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
    For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
    Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
    You shall by that perceive him and his means:
    Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
    With any strong or vehement importunity;
    Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
    Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
    As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
    And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.

OTHELLO

    Fear not my government.

IAGO

    I once more take my leave.

    Exit

OTHELLO

    This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
    And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
    Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
    Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
    I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
    To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
    And have not those soft parts of conversation
    That chamberers have, or for I am declined
    Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--
    She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
    Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
    That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
    And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
    And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
    Than keep a corner in the thing I love
    For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
    Prerogatived are they less than the base;
    'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:
    Even then this forked plague is fated to us
    When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:

    Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA
    If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
    I'll not believe't.

DESDEMONA

    How now, my dear Othello!
    Your dinner, and the generous islanders
    By you invited, do attend your presence.

OTHELLO

    I am to blame.

DESDEMONA

    Why do you speak so faintly?
    Are you not well?

OTHELLO

    I have a pain upon my forehead here.

DESDEMONA

    'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
    Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
    It will be well.

OTHELLO

    Your napkin is too little:

    He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops
    Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.

DESDEMONA

    I am very sorry that you are not well.

    Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA

EMILIA

    I am glad I have found this napkin:
    This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
    My wayward husband hath a hundred times
    Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
    For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
    That she reserves it evermore about her
    To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
    And give't Iago: what he will do with it
    Heaven knows, not I;
    I nothing but to please his fantasy.

    Re-enter Iago

IAGO

    How now! what do you here alone?

EMILIA

    Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.

IAGO

    A thing for me? it is a common thing--

EMILIA

    Ha!

IAGO

    To have a foolish wife.

EMILIA

    O, is that all? What will you give me now
    For the same handkerchief?

IAGO

    What handkerchief?

EMILIA

    What handkerchief?
    Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
    That which so often you did bid me steal.

IAGO

    Hast stol'n it from her?

EMILIA

    No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.
    And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.
    Look, here it is.

IAGO

    A good wench; give it me.

EMILIA

    What will you do with 't, that you have been
    so earnest
    To have me filch it?

IAGO

    [Snatching it] Why, what's that to you?

EMILIA

    If it be not for some purpose of import,
    Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
    When she shall lack it.

IAGO

    Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
    Go, leave me.

    Exit EMILIA
    I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
    And let him find it. Trifles light as air
    Are to the jealous confirmations strong
    As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.
    The Moor already changes with my poison:
    Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.
    Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
    But with a little act upon the blood.
    Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:
    Look, where he comes!

    Re-enter OTHELLO
    Not poppy, nor mandragora,
    Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
    Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
    Which thou owedst yesterday.

OTHELLO

    Ha! ha! false to me?

IAGO

    Why, how now, general! no more of that.

OTHELLO

    Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
    I swear 'tis better to be much abused
    Than but to know't a little.

IAGO

    How now, my lord!

OTHELLO

    What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
    I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:
    I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
    I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
    He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
    Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.

IAGO

    I am sorry to hear this.

OTHELLO

    I had been happy, if the general camp,
    Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
    So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever
    Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
    Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,
    That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
    Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
    The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
    The royal banner, and all quality,
    Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
    And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
    The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,
    Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!

IAGO

    Is't possible, my lord?

OTHELLO

    Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
    Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
    Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
    Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
    Than answer my waked wrath!

IAGO

    Is't come to this?

OTHELLO

    Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,
    That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
    To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!

IAGO

    My noble lord,--

OTHELLO

    If thou dost slander her and torture me,
    Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
    On horror's head horrors accumulate;
    Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
    For nothing canst thou to damnation add
    Greater than that.

IAGO

    O grace! O heaven forgive me!
    Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
    God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
    That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
    O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
    To be direct and honest is not safe.
    I thank you for this profit; and from hence
    I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.

OTHELLO

    Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.

IAGO

    I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
    And loses that it works for.

OTHELLO

    By the world,
    I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
    I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
    I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
    As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
    As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
    Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
    I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!

IAGO

    I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
    I do repent me that I put it to you.
    You would be satisfied?

OTHELLO

    Would! nay, I will.

IAGO

    And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
    Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--
    Behold her topp'd?

OTHELLO

    Death and damnation! O!

IAGO

    It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
    To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
    If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
    More than their own! What then? how then?
    What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
    It is impossible you should see this,
    Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
    As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
    As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
    If imputation and strong circumstances,
    Which lead directly to the door of truth,
    Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.

OTHELLO

    Give me a living reason she's disloyal.

IAGO

    I do not like the office:
    But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
    Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
    I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
    And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
    I could not sleep.
    There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
    That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
    One of this kind is Cassio:
    In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
    Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
    And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
    Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
    As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
    That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
    Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
    Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'

OTHELLO

    O monstrous! monstrous!

IAGO

    Nay, this was but his dream.

OTHELLO

    But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
    'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.

IAGO

    And this may help to thicken other proofs
    That do demonstrate thinly.

OTHELLO

    I'll tear her all to pieces.

IAGO

    Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
    She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
    Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
    Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?

OTHELLO

    I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.

IAGO

    I know not that; but such a handkerchief--
    I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
    See Cassio wipe his beard with.

OTHELLO

    If it be that--

IAGO

    If it be that, or any that was hers,
    It speaks against her with the other proofs.

OTHELLO

    O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
    One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
    Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
    All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
    'Tis gone.
    Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
    Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
    To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
    For 'tis of aspics' tongues!

IAGO

    Yet be content.

OTHELLO

    O, blood, blood, blood!

IAGO

    Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.

OTHELLO

    Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,
    Whose icy current and compulsive course
    Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
    To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
    Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
    Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
    Till that a capable and wide revenge
    Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,

    Kneels
    In the due reverence of a sacred vow
    I here engage my words.

IAGO

    Do not rise yet.

    Kneels
    Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
    You elements that clip us round about,
    Witness that here Iago doth give up
    The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
    To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
    And to obey shall be in me remorse,
    What bloody business ever.

    They rise

OTHELLO

    I greet thy love,
    Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
    And will upon the instant put thee to't:
    Within these three days let me hear thee say
    That Cassio's not alive.

IAGO

    My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
    But let her live.

OTHELLO

    Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
    Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
    To furnish me with some swift means of death
    For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.

IAGO

    I am your own for ever.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Before the castle.

    Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown

DESDEMONA

    Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?

Clown

    I dare not say he lies any where.

DESDEMONA

    Why, man?

Clown

    He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,
    is stabbing.

DESDEMONA

    Go to: where lodges he?

Clown

    To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.

DESDEMONA

    Can any thing be made of this?

Clown

    I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a
    lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were
    to lie in mine own throat.

DESDEMONA

    Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?

Clown

    I will catechise the world for him; that is, make
    questions, and by them answer.

DESDEMONA

    Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
    moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.

Clown

    To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and
    therefore I will attempt the doing it.

    Exit

DESDEMONA

    Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?

EMILIA

    I know not, madam.

DESDEMONA

    Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
    Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
    Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
    As jealous creatures are, it were enough
    To put him to ill thinking.

EMILIA

    Is he not jealous?

DESDEMONA

    Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
    Drew all such humours from him.

EMILIA

    Look, where he comes.

DESDEMONA

    I will not leave him now till Cassio
    Be call'd to him.

    Enter OTHELLO
    How is't with you, my lord

OTHELLO

    Well, my good lady.

    Aside
    O, hardness to dissemble!--
    How do you, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA

    Well, my good lord.

OTHELLO

    Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.

DESDEMONA

    It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.

OTHELLO

    This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
    Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires
    A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
    Much castigation, exercise devout;
    For here's a young and sweating devil here,
    That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
    A frank one.

DESDEMONA

    You may, indeed, say so;
    For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.

OTHELLO

    A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
    But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.

DESDEMONA

    I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.

OTHELLO

    What promise, chuck?

DESDEMONA

    I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.

OTHELLO

    I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
    Lend me thy handkerchief.

DESDEMONA

    Here, my lord.

OTHELLO

    That which I gave you.

DESDEMONA

    I have it not about me.

OTHELLO

    Not?

DESDEMONA

    No, indeed, my lord.

OTHELLO

    That is a fault.
    That handkerchief
    Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
    She was a charmer, and could almost read
    The thoughts of people: she told her, while
    she kept it,
    'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
    Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
    Or made gift of it, my father's eye
    Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
    After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
    And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
    To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
    Make it a darling like your precious eye;
    To lose't or give't away were such perdition
    As nothing else could match.

DESDEMONA

    Is't possible?

OTHELLO

    'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
    A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
    The sun to course two hundred compasses,
    In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
    The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
    And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
    Conserved of maidens' hearts.

DESDEMONA

    Indeed! is't true?

OTHELLO

    Most veritable; therefore look to't well.

DESDEMONA

    Then would to God that I had never seen't!

OTHELLO

    Ha! wherefore?

DESDEMONA

    Why do you speak so startingly and rash?

OTHELLO

    Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out
    o' the way?

DESDEMONA

    Heaven bless us!

OTHELLO

    Say you?

DESDEMONA

    It is not lost; but what an if it were?

OTHELLO

    How!

DESDEMONA

    I say, it is not lost.

OTHELLO

    Fetch't, let me see't.

DESDEMONA

    Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
    This is a trick to put me from my suit:
    Pray you, let Cassio be received again.

OTHELLO

    Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.

DESDEMONA

    Come, come;
    You'll never meet a more sufficient man.

OTHELLO

    The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA

    I pray, talk me of Cassio.

OTHELLO

    The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA

    A man that all his time
    Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
    Shared dangers with you,--

OTHELLO

    The handkerchief!

DESDEMONA

    In sooth, you are to blame.

OTHELLO

    Away!

    Exit

EMILIA

    Is not this man jealous?

DESDEMONA

    I ne'er saw this before.
    Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:
    I am most unhappy in the loss of it.

EMILIA

    'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
    They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
    To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,
    They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!

    Enter CASSIO and IAGO

IAGO

    There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:
    And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.

DESDEMONA

    How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?

CASSIO

    Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
    That by your virtuous means I may again
    Exist, and be a member of his love
    Whom I with all the office of my heart
    Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
    If my offence be of such mortal kind
    That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
    Nor purposed merit in futurity,
    Can ransom me into his love again,
    But to know so must be my benefit;
    So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
    And shut myself up in some other course,
    To fortune's alms.

DESDEMONA

    Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
    My advocation is not now in tune;
    My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
    Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
    So help me every spirit sanctified,
    As I have spoken for you all my best
    And stood within the blank of his displeasure
    For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
    What I can do I will; and more I will
    Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.

IAGO

    Is my lord angry?

EMILIA

    He went hence but now,
    And certainly in strange unquietness.

IAGO

    Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
    When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
    And, like the devil, from his very arm
    Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?
    Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
    There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.

DESDEMONA

    I prithee, do so.

    Exit IAGO
    Something, sure, of state,
    Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise
    Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
    Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
    Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
    Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
    For let our finger ache, and it indues
    Our other healthful members even to that sense
    Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
    Nor of them look for such observances
    As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
    I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
    Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
    But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
    And he's indicted falsely.

EMILIA

    Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
    And no conception nor no jealous toy
    Concerning you.

DESDEMONA

    Alas the day! I never gave him cause.

EMILIA

    But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
    They are not ever jealous for the cause,
    But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
    Begot upon itself, born on itself.

DESDEMONA

    Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!

EMILIA

    Lady, amen.

DESDEMONA

    I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:
    If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
    And seek to effect it to my uttermost.

CASSIO

    I humbly thank your ladyship.

    Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA

    Enter BIANCA

BIANCA

    Save you, friend Cassio!

CASSIO

    What make you from home?
    How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
    I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.

BIANCA

    And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
    What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
    Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
    More tedious than the dial eight score times?
    O weary reckoning!

CASSIO

    Pardon me, Bianca:
    I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:
    But I shall, in a more continuate time,
    Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,

    Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief
    Take me this work out.

BIANCA

    O Cassio, whence came this?
    This is some token from a newer friend:
    To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
    Is't come to this? Well, well.

CASSIO

    Go to, woman!
    Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
    From whence you have them. You are jealous now
    That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
    No, in good troth, Bianca.

BIANCA

    Why, whose is it?

CASSIO

    I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
    I like the work well: ere it be demanded--
    As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:
    Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.

BIANCA

    Leave you! wherefore?

CASSIO

    I do attend here on the general;
    And think it no addition, nor my wish,
    To have him see me woman'd.

BIANCA

    Why, I pray you?

CASSIO

    Not that I love you not.

BIANCA

    But that you do not love me.
    I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
    And say if I shall see you soon at night.

CASSIO

    'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;
    For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.

BIANCA

    'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Cyprus. Before the castle.

    Enter OTHELLO and IAGO

IAGO

    Will you think so?

OTHELLO

    Think so, Iago!

IAGO

    What,
    To kiss in private?

OTHELLO

    An unauthorized kiss.

IAGO

    Or to be naked with her friend in bed
    An hour or more, not meaning any harm?

OTHELLO

    Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
    It is hypocrisy against the devil:
    They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
    The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.

IAGO

    So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:
    But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--

OTHELLO

    What then?

IAGO

    Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
    She may, I think, bestow't on any man.

OTHELLO

    She is protectress of her honour too:
    May she give that?

IAGO

    Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
    They have it very oft that have it not:
    But, for the handkerchief,--

OTHELLO

    By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
    Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,
    As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
    Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.

IAGO

    Ay, what of that?

OTHELLO

    That's not so good now.

IAGO

    What,
    If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
    Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,
    Who having, by their own importunate suit,
    Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
    Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
    But they must blab--

OTHELLO

    Hath he said any thing?

IAGO

    He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
    No more than he'll unswear.

OTHELLO

    What hath he said?

IAGO

    'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.

OTHELLO

    What? what?

IAGO

    Lie--

OTHELLO

    With her?

IAGO

    With her, on her; what you will.

OTHELLO

    Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when
    they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.
    --Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To
    confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be
    hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.
    Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
    passion without some instruction. It is not words
    that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
    --Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--

    Falls in a trance

IAGO

    Work on,
    My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;
    And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
    All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!
    My lord, I say! Othello!

    Enter CASSIO
    How now, Cassio!

CASSIO

    What's the matter?

IAGO

    My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:
    This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.

CASSIO

    Rub him about the temples.

IAGO

    No, forbear;
    The lethargy must have his quiet course:
    If not, he foams at mouth and by and by
    Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
    Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
    He will recover straight: when he is gone,
    I would on great occasion speak with you.

    Exit CASSIO
    How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?

OTHELLO

    Dost thou mock me?

IAGO

    I mock you! no, by heaven.
    Would you would bear your fortune like a man!

OTHELLO

    A horned man's a monster and a beast.

IAGO

    There's many a beast then in a populous city,
    And many a civil monster.

OTHELLO

    Did he confess it?

IAGO

    Good sir, be a man;
    Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
    May draw with you: there's millions now alive
    That nightly lie in those unproper beds
    Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
    O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
    To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
    And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;
    And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.

OTHELLO

    O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.

IAGO

    Stand you awhile apart;
    Confine yourself but in a patient list.
    Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
    A passion most unsuiting such a man--
    Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
    And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,
    Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
    The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
    And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
    That dwell in every region of his face;
    For I will make him tell the tale anew,
    Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
    He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
    I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
    Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
    And nothing of a man.

OTHELLO

    Dost thou hear, Iago?
    I will be found most cunning in my patience;
    But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.

IAGO

    That's not amiss;
    But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?

    OTHELLO retires
    Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
    A housewife that by selling her desires
    Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
    That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
    To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
    He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
    From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:

    Re-enter CASSIO
    As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
    And his unbookish jealousy must construe
    Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,
    Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?

CASSIO

    The worser that you give me the addition
    Whose want even kills me.

IAGO

    Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.

    Speaking lower
    Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,
    How quickly should you speed!

CASSIO

    Alas, poor caitiff!

OTHELLO

    Look, how he laughs already!

IAGO

    I never knew woman love man so.

CASSIO

    Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.

OTHELLO

    Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.

IAGO

    Do you hear, Cassio?

OTHELLO

    Now he importunes him
    To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.

IAGO

    She gives it out that you shall marry hey:
    Do you intend it?

CASSIO

    Ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO

    Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?

CASSIO

    I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some
    charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
    Ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO

    So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.

IAGO

    'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.

CASSIO

    Prithee, say true.

IAGO

    I am a very villain else.

OTHELLO

    Have you scored me? Well.

CASSIO

    This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
    persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and
    flattery, not out of my promise.

OTHELLO

    Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.

CASSIO

    She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
    I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
    certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,
    and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--

OTHELLO

    Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture
    imports it.

CASSIO

    So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,
    and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!

OTHELLO

    Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,
    I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall
    throw it to.

CASSIO

    Well, I must leave her company.

IAGO

    Before me! look, where she comes.

CASSIO

    'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.

    Enter BIANCA
    What do you mean by this haunting of me?

BIANCA

    Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you
    mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
    I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the
    work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find
    it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
    This is some minx's token, and I must take out the
    work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever
    you had it, I'll take out no work on't.

CASSIO

    How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!

OTHELLO

    By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!

BIANCA

    An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you
    will not, come when you are next prepared for.

    Exit

IAGO

    After her, after her.

CASSIO

    'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.

IAGO

    Will you sup there?

CASSIO

    'Faith, I intend so.

IAGO

    Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain
    speak with you.

CASSIO

    Prithee, come; will you?

IAGO

    Go to; say no more.

    Exit CASSIO

OTHELLO

    [Advancing] How shall I murder him, Iago?

IAGO

    Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?

OTHELLO

    O Iago!

IAGO

    And did you see the handkerchief?

OTHELLO

    Was that mine?

IAGO

    Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the
    foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he
    hath given it his whore.

OTHELLO

    I would have him nine years a-killing.
    A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!

IAGO

    Nay, you must forget that.

OTHELLO

    Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;
    for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to
    stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the
    world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by
    an emperor's side and command him tasks.

IAGO

    Nay, that's not your way.

OTHELLO

    Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate
    with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she
    will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high
    and plenteous wit and invention:--

IAGO

    She's the worse for all this.

OTHELLO

    O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so
    gentle a condition!

IAGO

    Ay, too gentle.

OTHELLO

    Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!
    O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!

IAGO

    If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her
    patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes
    near nobody.

OTHELLO

    I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!

IAGO

    O, 'tis foul in her.

OTHELLO

    With mine officer!

IAGO

    That's fouler.

OTHELLO

    Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not
    expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty
    unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.

IAGO

    Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even
    the bed she hath contaminated.

OTHELLO

    Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.

IAGO

    And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you
    shall hear more by midnight.

OTHELLO

    Excellent good.

    A trumpet within
    What trumpet is that same?

IAGO

    Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
    Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.

    Enter LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants

LODOVICO

    Save you, worthy general!

OTHELLO

    With all my heart, sir.

LODOVICO

    The duke and senators of Venice greet you.

    Gives him a letter

OTHELLO

    I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.

    Opens the letter, and reads

DESDEMONA

    And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?

IAGO

    I am very glad to see you, signior
    Welcome to Cyprus.

LODOVICO

    I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?

IAGO

    Lives, sir.

DESDEMONA

    Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
    An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.

OTHELLO

    Are you sure of that?

DESDEMONA

    My lord?

OTHELLO

    [Reads] 'This fail you not to do, as you will--'

LODOVICO

    He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
    Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?

DESDEMONA

    A most unhappy one: I would do much
    To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.

OTHELLO

    Fire and brimstone!

DESDEMONA

    My lord?

OTHELLO

    Are you wise?

DESDEMONA

    What, is he angry?

LODOVICO

    May be the letter moved him;
    For, as I think, they do command him home,
    Deputing Cassio in his government.

DESDEMONA

    Trust me, I am glad on't.

OTHELLO

    Indeed!

DESDEMONA

    My lord?

OTHELLO

    I am glad to see you mad.

DESDEMONA

    Why, sweet Othello,--

OTHELLO

    [Striking her] Devil!

DESDEMONA

    I have not deserved this.

LODOVICO

    My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
    Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:
    Make her amends; she weeps.

OTHELLO

    O devil, devil!
    If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
    Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
    Out of my sight!

DESDEMONA

    I will not stay to offend you.

    Going

LODOVICO

    Truly, an obedient lady:
    I do beseech your lordship, call her back.

OTHELLO

    Mistress!

DESDEMONA

    My lord?

OTHELLO

    What would you with her, sir?

LODOVICO

    Who, I, my lord?

OTHELLO

    Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
    Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
    And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
    And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
    Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
    Concerning this, sir,--O well-painted passion!--
    I am commanded home. Get you away;
    I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
    And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!

    Exit DESDEMONA
    Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,
    I do entreat that we may sup together:
    You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!

    Exit

LODOVICO

    Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
    Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature
    Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
    The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,
    Could neither graze nor pierce?

IAGO

    He is much changed.

LODOVICO

    Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?

IAGO

    He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure
    What he might be: if what he might he is not,
    I would to heaven he were!

LODOVICO

    What, strike his wife!

IAGO

    'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
    That stroke would prove the worst!

LODOVICO

    Is it his use?
    Or did the letters work upon his blood,
    And new-create this fault?

IAGO

    Alas, alas!
    It is not honesty in me to speak
    What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
    And his own courses will denote him so
    That I may save my speech: do but go after,
    And mark how he continues.

LODOVICO

    I am sorry that I am deceived in him.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A room in the castle.

    Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA

OTHELLO

    You have seen nothing then?

EMILIA

    Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.

OTHELLO

    Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.

EMILIA

    But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
    Each syllable that breath made up between them.

OTHELLO

    What, did they never whisper?

EMILIA

    Never, my lord.

OTHELLO

    Nor send you out o' the way?

EMILIA

    Never.

OTHELLO

    To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?

EMILIA

    Never, my lord.

OTHELLO

    That's strange.

EMILIA

    I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
    Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
    Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
    If any wretch have put this in your head,
    Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
    For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
    There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
    Is foul as slander.

OTHELLO

    Bid her come hither: go.

    Exit EMILIA
    She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
    That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
    A closet lock and key of villanous secrets
    And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.

    Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA

DESDEMONA

    My lord, what is your will?

OTHELLO

    Pray, chuck, come hither.

DESDEMONA

    What is your pleasure?

OTHELLO

    Let me see your eyes;
    Look in my face.

DESDEMONA

    What horrible fancy's this?

OTHELLO

    [To EMILIA] Some of your function, mistress;
    Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
    Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:
    Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.

    Exit EMILIA

DESDEMONA

    Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
    I understand a fury in your words.
    But not the words.

OTHELLO

    Why, what art thou?

DESDEMONA

    Your wife, my lord; your true
    And loyal wife.

OTHELLO

    Come, swear it, damn thyself
    Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
    Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:
    Swear thou art honest.

DESDEMONA

    Heaven doth truly know it.

OTHELLO

    Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.

DESDEMONA

    To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?

OTHELLO

    O Desdemona! away! away! away!

DESDEMONA

    Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
    Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
    If haply you my father do suspect
    An instrument of this your calling back,
    Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,
    Why, I have lost him too.

OTHELLO

    Had it pleased heaven
    To try me with affliction; had they rain'd
    All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.
    Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
    Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
    I should have found in some place of my soul
    A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me
    A fixed figure for the time of scorn
    To point his slow unmoving finger at!
    Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
    But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
    Where either I must live, or bear no life;
    The fountain from the which my current runs,
    Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
    Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
    To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
    Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--
    Ay, there, look grim as hell!

DESDEMONA

    I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.

OTHELLO

    O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,
    That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,
    Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
    That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst
    ne'er been born!

DESDEMONA

    Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?

OTHELLO

    Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
    Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!
    Committed! O thou public commoner!
    I should make very forges of my cheeks,
    That would to cinders burn up modesty,
    Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
    Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
    The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
    Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
    And will not hear it. What committed!
    Impudent strumpet!

DESDEMONA

    By heaven, you do me wrong.

OTHELLO

    Are you not a strumpet?

DESDEMONA

    No, as I am a Christian:
    If to preserve this vessel for my lord
    From any other foul unlawful touch
    Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.

OTHELLO

    What, not a whore?

DESDEMONA

    No, as I shall be saved.

OTHELLO

    Is't possible?

DESDEMONA

    O, heaven forgive us!

OTHELLO

    I cry you mercy, then:
    I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
    That married with Othello.

    Raising his voice
    You, mistress,
    That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
    And keep the gate of hell!

    Re-enter EMILIA
    You, you, ay, you!
    We have done our course; there's money for your pains:
    I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.

    Exit

EMILIA

    Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
    How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?

DESDEMONA

    'Faith, half asleep.

EMILIA

    Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?

DESDEMONA

    With who?

EMILIA

    Why, with my lord, madam.

DESDEMONA

    Who is thy lord?

EMILIA

    He that is yours, sweet lady.

DESDEMONA

    I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
    I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
    But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
    Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
    And call thy husband hither.

EMILIA

    Here's a change indeed!

    Exit

DESDEMONA

    'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
    How have I been behaved, that he might stick
    The small'st opinion on my least misuse?

    Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO

IAGO

    What is your pleasure, madam?
    How is't with you?

DESDEMONA

    I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
    Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
    He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
    I am a child to chiding.

IAGO

    What's the matter, lady?

EMILIA

    Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.
    Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
    As true hearts cannot bear.

DESDEMONA

    Am I that name, Iago?

IAGO

    What name, fair lady?

DESDEMONA

    Such as she says my lord did say I was.

EMILIA

    He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
    Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.

IAGO

    Why did he so?

DESDEMONA

    I do not know; I am sure I am none such.

IAGO

    Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!

EMILIA

    Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
    Her father and her country and her friends,
    To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?

DESDEMONA

    It is my wretched fortune.

IAGO

    Beshrew him for't!
    How comes this trick upon him?

DESDEMONA

    Nay, heaven doth know.

EMILIA

    I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
    Some busy and insinuating rogue,
    Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
    Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.

IAGO

    Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.

DESDEMONA

    If any such there be, heaven pardon him!

EMILIA

    A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
    Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
    What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
    The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
    Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
    O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
    And put in every honest hand a whip
    To lash the rascals naked through the world
    Even from the east to the west!

IAGO

    Speak within door.

EMILIA

    O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
    That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
    And made you to suspect me with the Moor.

IAGO

    You are a fool; go to.

DESDEMONA

    O good Iago,
    What shall I do to win my lord again?
    Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
    I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
    If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
    Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
    Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
    Delighted them in any other form;
    Or that I do not yet, and ever did.
    And ever will--though he do shake me off
    To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,
    Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
    And his unkindness may defeat my life,
    But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
    It does abhor me now I speak the word;
    To do the act that might the addition earn
    Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.

IAGO

    I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:
    The business of the state does him offence,
    And he does chide with you.

DESDEMONA

    If 'twere no other--

IAGO

    'Tis but so, I warrant.

    Trumpets within
    Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
    The messengers of Venice stay the meat;
    Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.

    Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA

    Enter RODERIGO
    How now, Roderigo!

RODERIGO

    I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.

IAGO

    What in the contrary?

RODERIGO

    Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;
    and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me
    all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
    advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
    it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
    already I have foolishly suffered.

IAGO

    Will you hear me, Roderigo?

RODERIGO

    'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
    performances are no kin together.

IAGO

    You charge me most unjustly.

RODERIGO

    With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
    my means. The jewels you have had from me to
    deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
    votarist: you have told me she hath received them
    and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
    respect and acquaintance, but I find none.

IAGO

    Well; go to; very well.

RODERIGO

    Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis
    not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin
    to find myself fobbed in it.

IAGO

    Very well.

RODERIGO

    I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
    known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
    jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
    unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I
    will seek satisfaction of you.

IAGO

    You have said now.

RODERIGO

    Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.

IAGO

    Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from
    this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
    ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast
    taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I
    protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.

RODERIGO

    It hath not appeared.

IAGO

    I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
    suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
    Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I
    have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean
    purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
    thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
    take me from this world with treachery and devise
    engines for my life.

RODERIGO

    Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?

IAGO

    Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice
    to depute Cassio in Othello's place.

RODERIGO

    Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona
    return again to Venice.

IAGO

    O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
    him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
    lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
    so determinate as the removing of Cassio.

RODERIGO

    How do you mean, removing of him?

IAGO

    Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;
    knocking out his brains.

RODERIGO

    And that you would have me to do?

IAGO

    Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
    He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
    go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
    fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
    I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
    you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
    to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
    us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
    me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
    that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
    him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows
    to waste: about it.

RODERIGO

    I will hear further reason for this.

IAGO

    And you shall be satisfied.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Another room In the castle.

    Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA and Attendants

LODOVICO

    I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.

OTHELLO

    O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.

LODOVICO

    Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.

DESDEMONA

    Your honour is most welcome.

OTHELLO

    Will you walk, sir?
    O,--Desdemona,--

DESDEMONA

    My lord?

OTHELLO

    Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
    forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.

DESDEMONA

    I will, my lord.

    Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and Attendants

EMILIA

    How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.

DESDEMONA

    He says he will return incontinent:
    He hath commanded me to go to bed,
    And bade me to dismiss you.

EMILIA

    Dismiss me!

DESDEMONA

    It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.
    Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
    We must not now displease him.

EMILIA

    I would you had never seen him!

DESDEMONA

    So would not I my love doth so approve him,
    That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--
    Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.

EMILIA

    I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.

DESDEMONA

    All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
    If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me
    In one of those same sheets.

EMILIA

    Come, come you talk.

DESDEMONA

    My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
    She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
    And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
    An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
    And she died singing it: that song to-night
    Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,
    But to go hang my head all at one side,
    And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.

EMILIA

    Shall I go fetch your night-gown?

DESDEMONA

    No, unpin me here.
    This Lodovico is a proper man.

EMILIA

    A very handsome man.

DESDEMONA

    He speaks well.

EMILIA

    I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
    to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.

DESDEMONA

    [Singing] The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
    Sing all a green willow:
    Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
    Sing willow, willow, willow:
    The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;
    Sing willow, willow, willow;
    Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;
    Lay by these:--

    Singing
    Sing willow, willow, willow;
    Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--

    Singing
    Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
    Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-
    Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?

EMILIA

    It's the wind.

DESDEMONA

    [Singing] I call'd my love false love; but what
    said he then?
    Sing willow, willow, willow:
    If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!
    So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;
    Doth that bode weeping?

EMILIA

    'Tis neither here nor there.

DESDEMONA

    I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
    Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--
    That there be women do abuse their husbands
    In such gross kind?

EMILIA

    There be some such, no question.

DESDEMONA

    Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA

    Why, would not you?

DESDEMONA

    No, by this heavenly light!

EMILIA

    Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
    I might do't as well i' the dark.

DESDEMONA

    Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?

EMILIA

    The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
    For a small vice.

DESDEMONA

    In troth, I think thou wouldst not.

EMILIA

    In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had
    done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a
    joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
    gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty
    exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would
    not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
    monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.

DESDEMONA

    Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
    For the whole world.

EMILIA

    Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and
    having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your
    own world, and you might quickly make it right.

DESDEMONA

    I do not think there is any such woman.

EMILIA

    Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would
    store the world they played for.
    But I do think it is their husbands' faults
    If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,
    And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
    Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
    Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
    Or scant our former having in despite;
    Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
    Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
    Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
    And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
    As husbands have. What is it that they do
    When they change us for others? Is it sport?
    I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
    I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
    It is so too: and have not we affections,
    Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
    Then let them use us well: else let them know,
    The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.

DESDEMONA

    Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,
    Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Cyprus. A street.

    Enter IAGO and RODERIGO

IAGO

    Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
    Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:
    Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:
    It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
    And fix most firm thy resolution.

RODERIGO

    Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.

IAGO

    Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.

    Retires

RODERIGO

    I have no great devotion to the deed;
    And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
    'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.

IAGO

    I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
    And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
    Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
    Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
    He calls me to a restitution large
    Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
    As gifts to Desdemona;
    It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
    He hath a daily beauty in his life
    That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
    May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
    No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.

    Enter CASSIO

RODERIGO

    I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!

    Makes a pass at CASSIO

CASSIO

    That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
    But that my coat is better than thou know'st
    I will make proof of thine.

    Draws, and wounds RODERIGO

RODERIGO

    O, I am slain!

    IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit

CASSIO

    I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!

    Falls

    Enter OTHELLO

OTHELLO

    The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.

RODERIGO

    O, villain that I am!

OTHELLO

    It is even so.

CASSIO

    O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!

OTHELLO

    'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,
    That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
    Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
    And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
    Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
    Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.

    Exit

    Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO

CASSIO

    What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!

GRATIANO

    'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.

CASSIO

    O, help!

LODOVICO

    Hark!

RODERIGO

    O wretched villain!

LODOVICO

    Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
    These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
    To come in to the cry without more help.

RODERIGO

    Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.

LODOVICO

    Hark!

    Re-enter IAGO, with a light

GRATIANO

    Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.

IAGO

    Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?

LODOVICO

    We do not know.

IAGO

    Did not you hear a cry?

CASSIO

    Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!

IAGO

    What's the matter?

GRATIANO

    This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.

LODOVICO

    The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.

IAGO

    What are you here that cry so grievously?

CASSIO

    Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
    Give me some help.

IAGO

    O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?

CASSIO

    I think that one of them is hereabout,
    And cannot make away.

IAGO

    O treacherous villains!
    What are you there? come in, and give some help.

    To LODOVICO and GRATIANO

RODERIGO

    O, help me here!

CASSIO

    That's one of them.

IAGO

    O murderous slave! O villain!

    Stabs RODERIGO

RODERIGO

    O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!

IAGO

    Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--
    How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--
    What may you be? are you of good or evil?

LODOVICO

    As you shall prove us, praise us.

IAGO

    Signior Lodovico?

LODOVICO

    He, sir.

IAGO

    I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.

GRATIANO

    Cassio!

IAGO

    How is't, brother!

CASSIO

    My leg is cut in two.

IAGO

    Marry, heaven forbid!
    Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.

    Enter BIANCA

BIANCA

    What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?

IAGO

    Who is't that cried!

BIANCA

    O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,
    Cassio, Cassio!

IAGO

    O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
    Who they should be that have thus many led you?

CASSIO

    No.

GRATIANO

    I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.

IAGO

    Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
    To bear him easily hence!

BIANCA

    Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!

IAGO

    Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
    To be a party in this injury.
    Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
    Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
    Alas my friend and my dear countryman
    Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.

GRATIANO

    What, of Venice?

IAGO

    Even he, sir; did you know him?

GRATIANO

    Know him! ay.

IAGO

    Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
    These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
    That so neglected you.

GRATIANO

    I am glad to see you.

IAGO

    How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!

GRATIANO

    Roderigo!

IAGO

    He, he 'tis he.

    A chair brought in
    O, that's well said; the chair!

GRATIANO

    Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
    I'll fetch the general's surgeon.

    To BIANCA
    For you, mistress,
    Save you your labour. He that lies slain
    here, Cassio,
    Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?

CASSIO

    None in the world; nor do I know the man.

IAGO

    [To BIANCA] What, look you pale? O, bear him out
    o' the air.

    CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off
    Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
    Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
    Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
    Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
    Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,
    Though tongues were out of use.

    Enter EMILIA

EMILIA

    'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?

IAGO

    Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
    By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
    He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.

EMILIA

    Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!

IAGO

    This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
    Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.

    To BIANCA
    What, do you shake at that?

BIANCA

    He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.

IAGO

    O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.

EMILIA

    Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!

BIANCA

    I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
    As you that thus abuse me.

EMILIA

    As I! foh! fie upon thee!

IAGO

    Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
    Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
    Emilia run you to the citadel,
    And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
    Will you go on? I pray.

    Aside
    This is the night
    That either makes me or fordoes me quite.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep;

    a light burning.

    Enter OTHELLO

OTHELLO

    It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--
    Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--
    It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;
    Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
    And smooth as monumental alabaster.
    Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
    Put out the light, and then put out the light:
    If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
    I can again thy former light restore,
    Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,
    Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
    I know not where is that Promethean heat
    That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
    I cannot give it vital growth again.
    It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.

    Kissing her
    Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
    Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
    Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
    And love thee after. One more, and this the last:
    So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
    But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;
    It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.

DESDEMONA

    Who's there? Othello?

OTHELLO

    Ay. Desdemona.

DESDEMONA

    Will you come to bed, my lord?

OTHELLO

    Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?

DESDEMONA

    Ay, my lord.

OTHELLO

    If you bethink yourself of any crime
    Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
    Solicit for it straight.

DESDEMONA

    Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?

OTHELLO

    Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:
    I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
    No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.

DESDEMONA

    Talk you of killing?

OTHELLO

    Ay, I do.

DESDEMONA

    Then heaven
    Have mercy on me!

OTHELLO

    Amen, with all my heart!

DESDEMONA

    If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.

OTHELLO

    Hum!

DESDEMONA

    And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
    When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,
    Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.

OTHELLO

    Think on thy sins.

DESDEMONA

    They are loves I bear to you.

OTHELLO

    Ay, and for that thou diest.

DESDEMONA

    That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
    Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
    Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
    These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
    They do not point on me.

OTHELLO

    Peace, and be still!

DESDEMONA

    I will so. What's the matter?

OTHELLO

    That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
    Thou gavest to Cassio.

DESDEMONA

    No, by my life and soul!
    Send for the man, and ask him.

OTHELLO

    Sweet soul, take heed,
    Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.

DESDEMONA

    Ay, but not yet to die.

OTHELLO

    Yes, presently:
    Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
    For to deny each article with oath
    Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
    That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.

DESDEMONA

    Then Lord have mercy on me!

OTHELLO

    I say, amen.

DESDEMONA

    And have you mercy too! I never did
    Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
    But with such general warranty of heaven
    As I might love: I never gave him token.

OTHELLO

    By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.
    O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
    And makest me call what I intend to do
    A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
    I saw the handkerchief.

DESDEMONA

    He found it then;
    I never gave it him: send for him hither;
    Let him confess a truth.

OTHELLO

    He hath confess'd.

DESDEMONA

    What, my lord?

OTHELLO

    That he hath used thee.

DESDEMONA

    How? unlawfully?

OTHELLO

    Ay.

DESDEMONA

    He will not say so.

OTHELLO

    No, his mouth is stopp'd;
    Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.

DESDEMONA

    O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?

OTHELLO

    Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
    Had stomach for them all.

DESDEMONA

    Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.

OTHELLO

    Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?

DESDEMONA

    O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!

OTHELLO

    Down, strumpet!

DESDEMONA

    Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!

OTHELLO

    Nay, if you strive--

DESDEMONA

    But half an hour!

OTHELLO

    Being done, there is no pause.

DESDEMONA

    But while I say one prayer!

OTHELLO

    It is too late.

    He stifles her

EMILIA

    [Within] My lord , my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!

OTHELLO

    What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
    I that am cruel am yet merciful;
    I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.

EMILIA

    [Within] What, ho! my lord, my lord!

OTHELLO

    Who's there?

EMILIA

    [Within] O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!

OTHELLO

    Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
    'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--
    The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
    Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--
    I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?
    If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:
    My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.
    O insupportable! O heavy hour!
    Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
    Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
    Should yawn at alteration.

EMILIA

    [Within] I do beseech you
    That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!

OTHELLO

    I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;
    Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
    Where art thou?

    Unlocks the door

    Enter EMILIA
    What's the matter with thee now?

EMILIA

    O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!

OTHELLO

    What, now?

EMILIA

    But now, my lord.

OTHELLO

    It is the very error of the moon;
    She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,
    And makes men mad.

EMILIA

    Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
    Call'd Roderigo.

OTHELLO

    Roderigo kill'd!
    And Cassio kill'd!

EMILIA

    No, Cassio is not kill'd.

OTHELLO

    Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,
    And sweet revenge grows harsh.

DESDEMONA

    O, falsely, falsely murder'd!

EMILIA

    Alas, what cry is that?

OTHELLO

    That! what?

EMILIA

    Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
    Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
    Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!

DESDEMONA

    A guiltless death I die.

EMILIA

    O, who hath done this deed?

DESDEMONA

    Nobody; I myself. Farewell
    Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!

    Dies

OTHELLO

    Why, how should she be murder'd?

EMILIA

    Alas, who knows?

OTHELLO

    You heard her say herself, it was not I.

EMILIA

    She said so: I must needs report the truth.

OTHELLO

    She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
    'Twas I that kill'd her.

EMILIA

    O, the more angel she,
    And you the blacker devil!

OTHELLO

    She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.

EMILIA

    Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.

OTHELLO

    She was false as water.

EMILIA

    Thou art rash as fire, to say
    That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!

OTHELLO

    Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
    O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,
    But that I did proceed upon just grounds
    To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.

EMILIA

    My husband!

OTHELLO

    Thy husband.

EMILIA

    That she was false to wedlock?

OTHELLO

    Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
    If heaven would make me such another world
    Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,
    I'ld not have sold her for it.

EMILIA

    My husband!

OTHELLO

    Ay, 'twas he that told me first:
    An honest man he is, and hates the slime
    That sticks on filthy deeds.

EMILIA

    My husband!

OTHELLO

    What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.

EMILIA

    O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,
    My husband say that she was false!

OTHELLO

    He, woman;
    I say thy husband: dost understand the word?
    My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.

EMILIA

    If he say so, may his pernicious soul
    Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
    She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.

OTHELLO

    Ha!

EMILIA

    Do thy worst:
    This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
    Than thou wast worthy her.

OTHELLO

    Peace, you were best.

EMILIA

    Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
    As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
    As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--
    I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
    Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!
    The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!

    Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others

MONTANO

    What is the matter? How now, general!

EMILIA

    O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
    That men must lay their murders on your neck.

GRATIANO

    What is the matter?

EMILIA

    Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
    He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
    I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:
    Speak, for my heart is full.

IAGO

    I told him what I thought, and told no more
    Than what he found himself was apt and true.

EMILIA

    But did you ever tell him she was false?

IAGO

    I did.

EMILIA

    You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
    Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
    She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?

IAGO

    With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.

EMILIA

    I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
    My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--

All

    O heavens forfend!

EMILIA

    And your reports have set the murder on.

OTHELLO

    Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.

GRATIANO

    'Tis a strange truth.

MONTANO

    O monstrous act!

EMILIA

    Villany, villany, villany!
    I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--
    I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--
    O villany, villany!

IAGO

    What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.

EMILIA

    Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
    'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
    Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.

OTHELLO

    O! O! O!

    He falls on the bed

EMILIA

    Nay, lay thee down and roar;
    For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
    That e'er did lift up eye.

OTHELLO

    [Rising] O, she was foul!
    I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,
    Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:
    I know this act shows horrible and grim.

GRATIANO

    Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:
    Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
    Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
    This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
    Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
    And fall to reprobation.

OTHELLO

    'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
    That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
    A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
    And she did gratify his amorous works
    With that recognizance and pledge of love
    Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
    It was a handkerchief, an antique token
    My father gave my mother.

EMILIA

    O heaven! O heavenly powers!

IAGO

    Come, hold your peace.

EMILIA

    'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!
    No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
    Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
    All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.

IAGO

    Be wise, and get you home.

EMILIA

    I will not.

    IAGO offers to stab EMILIA

GRATIANO

    Fie!
    Your sword upon a woman?

EMILIA

    O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
    I found by fortune and did give my husband;
    For often, with a solemn earnestness,
    More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
    He begg'd of me to steal it.

IAGO

    Villanous whore!

EMILIA

    She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,
    And I did give't my husband.

IAGO

    Filth, thou liest!

EMILIA

    By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
    O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
    Do with so good a woman?

OTHELLO

    Are there no stones in heaven
    But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!

    He runs at IAGO IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit

GRATIANO

    The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.

EMILIA

    Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.

GRATIANO

    He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.

MONTANO

    'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
    Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:
    Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
    But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,
    For 'tis a damned slave.

    Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO

OTHELLO

    I am not valiant neither,
    But ever puny whipster gets my sword:
    But why should honour outlive honesty?
    Let it go all.

EMILIA

    What did thy song bode, lady?
    Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
    And die in music.

    Singing
    Willow, willow, willow,--
    Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
    So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
    So speaking as I think, I die, I die.

    Dies

OTHELLO

    I have another weapon in this chamber;
    It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--
    O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.

GRATIANO

    [Within] If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:
    Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.

OTHELLO

    Look in upon me then and speak with me,
    Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.

    Re-enter GRATIANO

GRATIANO

    What is the matter?

OTHELLO

    Behold, I have a weapon;
    A better never did itself sustain
    Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,
    That, with this little arm and this good sword,
    I have made my way through more impediments
    Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
    Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
    Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
    Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
    And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
    Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
    Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
    And he retires. Where should Othello go?
    Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
    Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
    This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
    And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
    Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
    Whip me, ye devils,
    From the possession of this heavenly sight!
    Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
    Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
    O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
    Oh! Oh! Oh!

    Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair, and Officers with IAGO, prisoner

LODOVICO

    Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?

OTHELLO

    That's he that was Othello: here I am.

LODOVICO

    Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.

OTHELLO

    I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
    If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.

    Wounds IAGO

LODOVICO

    Wrench his sword from him.

IAGO

    I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.

OTHELLO

    I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;
    For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.

LODOVICO

    O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,
    Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,
    What shall be said to thee?

OTHELLO

    Why, any thing:
    An honourable murderer, if you will;
    For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.

LODOVICO

    This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:
    Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?

OTHELLO

    Ay.

CASSIO

    Dear general, I never gave you cause.

OTHELLO

    I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
    Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
    Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?

IAGO

    Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
    From this time forth I never will speak word.

LODOVICO

    What, not to pray?

GRATIANO

    Torments will ope your lips.

OTHELLO

    Well, thou dost best.

LODOVICO

    Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
    Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
    Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;
    And here another: the one of them imports
    The death of Cassio to be undertook
    By Roderigo.

OTHELLO

    O villain!

CASSIO

    Most heathenish and most gross!

LODOVICO

    Now here's another discontented paper,
    Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
    Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;
    But that belike Iago in the interim
    Came in and satisfied him.

OTHELLO

    O the pernicious caitiff!
    How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
    That was my wife's?

CASSIO

    I found it in my chamber:
    And he himself confess'd but even now
    That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
    Which wrought to his desire.

OTHELLO

    O fool! fool! fool!

CASSIO

    There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
    How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
    Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
    That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
    After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
    Iago set him on.

LODOVICO

    You must forsake this room, and go with us:
    Your power and your command is taken off,
    And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
    If there be any cunning cruelty
    That can torment him much and hold him long,
    It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
    Till that the nature of your fault be known
    To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.

OTHELLO

    Soft you; a word or two before you go.
    I have done the state some service, and they know't.
    No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
    When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
    Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
    Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak
    Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
    Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
    Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
    Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
    Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
    Albeit unused to the melting mood,
    Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
    Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
    And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
    Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
    Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
    I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
    And smote him, thus.

    Stabs himself

LODOVICO

    O bloody period!

GRATIANO

    All that's spoke is marr'd.

OTHELLO

    I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;
    Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.

    Falls on the bed, and dies

CASSIO

    This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
    For he was great of heart.

LODOVICO

    [To IAGO] O Spartan dog,
    More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
    Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
    This is thy work: the object poisons sight;
    Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,
    And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
    For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,
    Remains the censure of this hellish villain;
    The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!
    Myself will straight aboard: and to the state
    This heavy act with heavy heart relate.

    Exeunt


Romeo and Juliet

ACT I
PROLOGUE

    Two households, both alike in dignity,
    In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
    From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
    Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
    From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
    A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
    Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
    Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
    The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
    And the continuance of their parents' rage,
    Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
    Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
    The which if you with patient ears attend,
    What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

SCENE I. Verona. A public place.

    Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers

SAMPSON

    Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.

GREGORY

    No, for then we should be colliers.

SAMPSON

    I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.

GREGORY

    Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.

SAMPSON

    I strike quickly, being moved.

GREGORY

    But thou art not quickly moved to strike.

SAMPSON

    A dog of the house of Montague moves me.

GREGORY

    To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
    therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.

SAMPSON

    A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
    take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.

GREGORY

    That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
    to the wall.

SAMPSON

    True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
    are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
    Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
    to the wall.

GREGORY

    The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.

SAMPSON

    'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
    have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
    maids, and cut off their heads.

GREGORY

    The heads of the maids?

SAMPSON

    Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
    take it in what sense thou wilt.

GREGORY

    They must take it in sense that feel it.

SAMPSON

    Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
    'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.

GREGORY

    'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
    hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
    two of the house of the Montagues.

SAMPSON

    My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.

GREGORY

    How! turn thy back and run?

SAMPSON

    Fear me not.

GREGORY

    No, marry; I fear thee!

SAMPSON

    Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.

GREGORY

    I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
    they list.

SAMPSON

    Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
    which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.

    Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR

ABRAHAM

    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON

    I do bite my thumb, sir.

ABRAHAM

    Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

SAMPSON

    [Aside to GREGORY] Is the law of our side, if I say
    ay?

GREGORY

    No.

SAMPSON

    No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
    bite my thumb, sir.

GREGORY

    Do you quarrel, sir?

ABRAHAM

    Quarrel sir! no, sir.

SAMPSON

    If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.

ABRAHAM

    No better.

SAMPSON

    Well, sir.

GREGORY

    Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.

SAMPSON

    Yes, better, sir.

ABRAHAM

    You lie.

SAMPSON

    Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.

    They fight

    Enter BENVOLIO

BENVOLIO

    Part, fools!
    Put up your swords; you know not what you do.

    Beats down their swords

    Enter TYBALT

TYBALT

    What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
    Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.

BENVOLIO

    I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
    Or manage it to part these men with me.

TYBALT

    What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
    As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
    Have at thee, coward!

    They fight

    Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray; then enter Citizens, with clubs

First Citizen

    Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
    Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!

    Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET

CAPULET

    What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!

LADY CAPULET

    A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?

CAPULET

    My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
    And flourishes his blade in spite of me.

    Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

MONTAGUE

    Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.

LADY MONTAGUE

    Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.

    Enter PRINCE, with Attendants

PRINCE

    Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
    Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
    Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
    That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
    With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
    On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
    Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
    And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
    Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
    By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
    Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
    And made Verona's ancient citizens
    Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
    To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
    Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
    If ever you disturb our streets again,
    Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
    For this time, all the rest depart away:
    You Capulet; shall go along with me:
    And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
    To know our further pleasure in this case,
    To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
    Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.

    Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO

MONTAGUE

    Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
    Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?

BENVOLIO

    Here were the servants of your adversary,
    And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
    I drew to part them: in the instant came
    The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
    Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
    He swung about his head and cut the winds,
    Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
    While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
    Came more and more and fought on part and part,
    Till the prince came, who parted either part.

LADY MONTAGUE

    O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
    Right glad I am he was not at this fray.

BENVOLIO

    Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
    Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
    A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
    Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
    That westward rooteth from the city's side,
    So early walking did I see your son:
    Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
    And stole into the covert of the wood:
    I, measuring his affections by my own,
    That most are busied when they're most alone,
    Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
    And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.

MONTAGUE

    Many a morning hath he there been seen,
    With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
    Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
    But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
    Should in the furthest east begin to draw
    The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
    Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
    And private in his chamber pens himself,
    Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
    And makes himself an artificial night:
    Black and portentous must this humour prove,
    Unless good counsel may the cause remove.

BENVOLIO

    My noble uncle, do you know the cause?

MONTAGUE

    I neither know it nor can learn of him.

BENVOLIO

    Have you importuned him by any means?

MONTAGUE

    Both by myself and many other friends:
    But he, his own affections' counsellor,
    Is to himself--I will not say how true--
    But to himself so secret and so close,
    So far from sounding and discovery,
    As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
    Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
    Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
    Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
    We would as willingly give cure as know.

    Enter ROMEO

BENVOLIO

    See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
    I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

MONTAGUE

    I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
    To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.

    Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE

BENVOLIO

    Good-morrow, cousin.

ROMEO

    Is the day so young?

BENVOLIO

    But new struck nine.

ROMEO

    Ay me! sad hours seem long.
    Was that my father that went hence so fast?

BENVOLIO

    It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

ROMEO

    Not having that, which, having, makes them short.

BENVOLIO

    In love?

ROMEO

    Out--

BENVOLIO

    Of love?

ROMEO

    Out of her favour, where I am in love.

BENVOLIO

    Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
    Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!

ROMEO

    Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
    Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
    Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
    Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
    Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
    Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
    O any thing, of nothing first create!
    O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
    Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
    Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
    sick health!
    Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
    This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
    Dost thou not laugh?

BENVOLIO

    No, coz, I rather weep.

ROMEO

    Good heart, at what?

BENVOLIO

    At thy good heart's oppression.

ROMEO

    Why, such is love's transgression.
    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
    Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
    With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
    Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
    Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
    Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
    What is it else? a madness most discreet,
    A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
    Farewell, my coz.

BENVOLIO

    Soft! I will go along;
    An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.

ROMEO

    Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
    This is not Romeo, he's some other where.

BENVOLIO

    Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.

ROMEO

    What, shall I groan and tell thee?

BENVOLIO

    Groan! why, no.
    But sadly tell me who.

ROMEO

    Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
    Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
    In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.

BENVOLIO

    I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.

ROMEO

    A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.

BENVOLIO

    A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.

ROMEO

    Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
    With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
    And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
    From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
    She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
    Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
    Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
    O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
    That when she dies with beauty dies her store.

BENVOLIO

    Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?

ROMEO

    She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
    For beauty starved with her severity
    Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
    She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
    To merit bliss by making me despair:
    She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
    Do I live dead that live to tell it now.

BENVOLIO

    Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.

ROMEO

    O, teach me how I should forget to think.

BENVOLIO

    By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
    Examine other beauties.

ROMEO

    'Tis the way
    To call hers exquisite, in question more:
    These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
    Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
    He that is strucken blind cannot forget
    The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
    Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
    What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
    Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
    Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.

BENVOLIO

    I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A street.

    Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant

CAPULET

    But Montague is bound as well as I,
    In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
    For men so old as we to keep the peace.

PARIS

    Of honourable reckoning are you both;
    And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
    But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?

CAPULET

    But saying o'er what I have said before:
    My child is yet a stranger in the world;
    She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
    Let two more summers wither in their pride,
    Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.

PARIS

    Younger than she are happy mothers made.

CAPULET

    And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
    The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
    She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
    But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
    My will to her consent is but a part;
    An she agree, within her scope of choice
    Lies my consent and fair according voice.
    This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
    Whereto I have invited many a guest,
    Such as I love; and you, among the store,
    One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
    At my poor house look to behold this night
    Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
    Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
    When well-apparell'd April on the heel
    Of limping winter treads, even such delight
    Among fresh female buds shall you this night
    Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
    And like her most whose merit most shall be:
    Which on more view, of many mine being one
    May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
    Come, go with me.

    To Servant, giving a paper
    Go, sirrah, trudge about
    Through fair Verona; find those persons out
    Whose names are written there, and to them say,
    My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.

    Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS

Servant

    Find them out whose names are written here! It is
    written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
    yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
    his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
    sent to find those persons whose names are here
    writ, and can never find what names the writing
    person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.

    Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO

BENVOLIO

    Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
    One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
    Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
    One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
    Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
    And the rank poison of the old will die.

ROMEO

    Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.

BENVOLIO

    For what, I pray thee?

ROMEO

    For your broken shin.

BENVOLIO

    Why, Romeo, art thou mad?

ROMEO

    Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
    Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
    Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.

Servant

    God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?

ROMEO

    Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.

Servant

    Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
    pray, can you read any thing you see?

ROMEO

    Ay, if I know the letters and the language.

Servant

    Ye say honestly: rest you merry!

ROMEO

    Stay, fellow; I can read.

    Reads
    'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
    County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
    widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
    nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
    uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
    Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
    Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
    assembly: whither should they come?

Servant

    Up.

ROMEO

    Whither?

Servant

    To supper; to our house.

ROMEO

    Whose house?

Servant

    My master's.

ROMEO

    Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.

Servant

    Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
    great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
    of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
    Rest you merry!

    Exit

BENVOLIO

    At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
    Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
    With all the admired beauties of Verona:
    Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
    Compare her face with some that I shall show,
    And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.

ROMEO

    When the devout religion of mine eye
    Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
    And these, who often drown'd could never die,
    Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
    One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
    Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.

BENVOLIO

    Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
    Herself poised with herself in either eye:
    But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
    Your lady's love against some other maid
    That I will show you shining at this feast,
    And she shall scant show well that now shows best.

ROMEO

    I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
    But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in Capulet's house.

    Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse

LADY CAPULET

    Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.

Nurse

    Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
    I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
    God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!

    Enter JULIET

JULIET

    How now! who calls?

Nurse

    Your mother.

JULIET

    Madam, I am here.
    What is your will?

LADY CAPULET

    This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
    We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
    I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
    Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.

Nurse

    Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.

LADY CAPULET

    She's not fourteen.

Nurse

    I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
    And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
    She is not fourteen. How long is it now
    To Lammas-tide?

LADY CAPULET

    A fortnight and odd days.

Nurse

    Even or odd, of all days in the year,
    Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
    Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
    Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
    She was too good for me: but, as I said,
    On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
    That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
    'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
    And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
    Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
    For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
    Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
    My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
    Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
    When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
    Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
    To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
    Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
    To bid me trudge:
    And since that time it is eleven years;
    For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
    She could have run and waddled all about;
    For even the day before, she broke her brow:
    And then my husband--God be with his soul!
    A' was a merry man--took up the child:
    'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
    The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
    To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
    I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
    I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
    And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'

LADY CAPULET

    Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.

Nurse

    Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
    To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
    And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
    A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
    A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
    'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
    Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
    Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'

JULIET

    And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.

Nurse

    Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
    Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
    An I might live to see thee married once,
    I have my wish.

LADY CAPULET

    Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
    I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
    How stands your disposition to be married?

JULIET

    It is an honour that I dream not of.

Nurse

    An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
    I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.

LADY CAPULET

    Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
    Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
    Are made already mothers: by my count,
    I was your mother much upon these years
    That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
    The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.

Nurse

    A man, young lady! lady, such a man
    As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.

LADY CAPULET

    Verona's summer hath not such a flower.

Nurse

    Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.

LADY CAPULET

    What say you? can you love the gentleman?
    This night you shall behold him at our feast;
    Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
    And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
    Examine every married lineament,
    And see how one another lends content
    And what obscured in this fair volume lies
    Find written in the margent of his eyes.
    This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
    To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
    The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
    For fair without the fair within to hide:
    That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
    That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
    So shall you share all that he doth possess,
    By having him, making yourself no less.

Nurse

    No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.

LADY CAPULET

    Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?

JULIET

    I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
    But no more deep will I endart mine eye
    Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.

    Enter a Servant

Servant

    Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
    called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
    the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
    hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.

LADY CAPULET

    We follow thee.

    Exit Servant
    Juliet, the county stays.

Nurse

    Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A street.

    Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others

ROMEO

    What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
    Or shall we on without a apology?

BENVOLIO

    The date is out of such prolixity:
    We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
    Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
    Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
    Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
    After the prompter, for our entrance:
    But let them measure us by what they will;
    We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.

ROMEO

    Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
    Being but heavy, I will bear the light.

MERCUTIO

    Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.

ROMEO

    Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
    With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
    So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.

MERCUTIO

    You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
    And soar with them above a common bound.

ROMEO

    I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
    To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
    I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
    Under love's heavy burden do I sink.

MERCUTIO

    And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
    Too great oppression for a tender thing.

ROMEO

    Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
    Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.

MERCUTIO

    If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
    Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
    Give me a case to put my visage in:
    A visor for a visor! what care I
    What curious eye doth quote deformities?
    Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.

BENVOLIO

    Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
    But every man betake him to his legs.

ROMEO

    A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
    Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
    For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
    I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
    The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.

MERCUTIO

    Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
    If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
    Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
    Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!

ROMEO

    Nay, that's not so.

MERCUTIO

    I mean, sir, in delay
    We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
    Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
    Five times in that ere once in our five wits.

ROMEO

    And we mean well in going to this mask;
    But 'tis no wit to go.

MERCUTIO

    Why, may one ask?

ROMEO

    I dream'd a dream to-night.

MERCUTIO

    And so did I.

ROMEO

    Well, what was yours?

MERCUTIO

    That dreamers often lie.

ROMEO

    In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.

MERCUTIO

    O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
    She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
    In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
    On the fore-finger of an alderman,
    Drawn with a team of little atomies
    Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
    Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
    The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
    The traces of the smallest spider's web,
    The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
    Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
    Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
    Not so big as a round little worm
    Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
    Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
    Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
    Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
    And in this state she gallops night by night
    Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
    O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
    O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
    O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
    Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
    Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
    Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
    And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
    And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
    Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
    Then dreams, he of another benefice:
    Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
    And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
    Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
    Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
    Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
    And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
    And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
    That plats the manes of horses in the night,
    And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
    Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
    This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
    That presses them and learns them first to bear,
    Making them women of good carriage:
    This is she--

ROMEO

    Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
    Thou talk'st of nothing.

MERCUTIO

    True, I talk of dreams,
    Which are the children of an idle brain,
    Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
    Which is as thin of substance as the air
    And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
    Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
    And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
    Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.

BENVOLIO

    This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
    Supper is done, and we shall come too late.

ROMEO

    I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
    Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
    Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
    With this night's revels and expire the term
    Of a despised life closed in my breast
    By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
    But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
    Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.

BENVOLIO

    Strike, drum.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. A hall in Capulet's house.

    Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins

First Servant

    Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
    shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!

Second Servant

    When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
    hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.

First Servant

    Away with the joint-stools, remove the
    court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
    me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
    the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
    Antony, and Potpan!

Second Servant

    Ay, boy, ready.

First Servant

    You are looked for and called for, asked for and
    sought for, in the great chamber.

Second Servant

    We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
    brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.

    Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers

CAPULET

    Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
    Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
    Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
    Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
    She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
    Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
    That I have worn a visor and could tell
    A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
    Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
    You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
    A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.

    Music plays, and they dance
    More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
    And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
    Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
    Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
    For you and I are past our dancing days:
    How long is't now since last yourself and I
    Were in a mask?

Second Capulet

    By'r lady, thirty years.

CAPULET

    What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
    'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
    Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
    Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.

Second Capulet

    'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
    His son is thirty.

CAPULET

    Will you tell me that?
    His son was but a ward two years ago.

ROMEO

    [To a Servingman] What lady is that, which doth
    enrich the hand
    Of yonder knight?

Servant

    I know not, sir.

ROMEO

    O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
    It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
    Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
    Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
    So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
    As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
    The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
    And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
    Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
    For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.

TYBALT

    This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
    Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
    Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
    To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
    Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
    To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.

CAPULET

    Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?

TYBALT

    Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
    A villain that is hither come in spite,
    To scorn at our solemnity this night.

CAPULET

    Young Romeo is it?

TYBALT

    'Tis he, that villain Romeo.

CAPULET

    Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
    He bears him like a portly gentleman;
    And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
    To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
    I would not for the wealth of all the town
    Here in my house do him disparagement:
    Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
    It is my will, the which if thou respect,
    Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
    And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.

TYBALT

    It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
    I'll not endure him.

CAPULET

    He shall be endured:
    What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
    Am I the master here, or you? go to.
    You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
    You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
    You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!

TYBALT

    Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.

CAPULET

    Go to, go to;
    You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
    This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
    You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
    Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
    Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
    I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!

TYBALT

    Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
    Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
    I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
    Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.

    Exit

ROMEO

    [To JULIET] If I profane with my unworthiest hand
    This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
    My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
    To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.

JULIET

    Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
    Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
    For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
    And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

ROMEO

    Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

JULIET

    Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.

ROMEO

    O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
    They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

JULIET

    Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

ROMEO

    Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
    Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.

JULIET

    Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

ROMEO

    Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
    Give me my sin again.

JULIET

    You kiss by the book.

Nurse

    Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

ROMEO

    What is her mother?

Nurse

    Marry, bachelor,
    Her mother is the lady of the house,
    And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
    I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
    I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
    Shall have the chinks.

ROMEO

    Is she a Capulet?
    O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.

BENVOLIO

    Away, begone; the sport is at the best.

ROMEO

    Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.

CAPULET

    Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
    We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
    Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
    I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
    More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
    Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
    I'll to my rest.

    Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse

JULIET

    Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?

Nurse

    The son and heir of old Tiberio.

JULIET

    What's he that now is going out of door?

Nurse

    Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.

JULIET

    What's he that follows there, that would not dance?

Nurse

    I know not.

JULIET

    Go ask his name: if he be married.
    My grave is like to be my wedding bed.

Nurse

    His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
    The only son of your great enemy.

JULIET

    My only love sprung from my only hate!
    Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
    Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
    That I must love a loathed enemy.

Nurse

    What's this? what's this?

JULIET

    A rhyme I learn'd even now
    Of one I danced withal.

    One calls within 'Juliet.'

Nurse

    Anon, anon!
    Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

    Exeunt

ACT II
PROLOGUE

    Enter Chorus

Chorus

    Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
    And young affection gapes to be his heir;
    That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
    With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
    Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
    Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
    But to his foe supposed he must complain,
    And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
    Being held a foe, he may not have access
    To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
    And she as much in love, her means much less
    To meet her new-beloved any where:
    But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
    Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

    Exit

SCENE I. A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.

    Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

    Can I go forward when my heart is here?
    Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.

    He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it

    Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO

BENVOLIO

    Romeo! my cousin Romeo!

MERCUTIO

    He is wise;
    And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.

BENVOLIO

    He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
    Call, good Mercutio.

MERCUTIO

    Nay, I'll conjure too.
    Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
    Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
    Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
    Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
    Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
    One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
    Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
    When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
    He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
    The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
    I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
    By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
    By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
    And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
    That in thy likeness thou appear to us!

BENVOLIO

    And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.

MERCUTIO

    This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
    To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
    Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
    Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
    That were some spite: my invocation
    Is fair and honest, and in his mistres s' name
    I conjure only but to raise up him.

BENVOLIO

    Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
    To be consorted with the humorous night:
    Blind is his love and best befits the dark.

MERCUTIO

    If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
    Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
    And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
    As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
    Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
    An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
    Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
    This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
    Come, shall we go?

BENVOLIO

    Go, then; for 'tis in vain
    To seek him here that means not to be found.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.

    Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

    He jests at scars that never felt a wound.

    JULIET appears above at a window
    But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
    It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
    Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
    Who is already sick and pale with grief,
    That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
    Be not her maid, since she is envious;
    Her vestal livery is but sick and green
    And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
    It is my lady, O, it is my love!
    O, that she knew she were!
    She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
    Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
    I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
    Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
    Having some business, do entreat her eyes
    To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
    What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
    The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
    As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
    Would through the airy region stream so bright
    That birds would sing and think it were not night.
    See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
    O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
    That I might touch that cheek!

JULIET

    Ay me!

ROMEO

    She speaks:
    O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
    As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
    As is a winged messenger of heaven
    Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
    Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
    When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
    And sails upon the bosom of the air.

JULIET

    O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
    Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
    Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
    And I'll no longer be a Capulet.

ROMEO

    [Aside] Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

JULIET

    'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
    Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
    What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
    Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
    Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
    What's in a name? that which we call a rose
    By any other name would smell as sweet;
    So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
    Retain that dear perfection which he owes
    Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
    And for that name which is no part of thee
    Take all myself.

ROMEO

    I take thee at thy word:
    Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
    Henceforth I never will be Romeo.

JULIET

    What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
    So stumblest on my counsel?

ROMEO

    By a name
    I know not how to tell thee who I am:
    My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
    Because it is an enemy to thee;
    Had I it written, I would tear the word.

JULIET

    My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
    Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
    Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?

ROMEO

    Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.

JULIET

    How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
    The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
    And the place death, considering who thou art,
    If any of my kinsmen find thee here.

ROMEO

    With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
    For stony limits cannot hold love out,
    And what love can do that dares love attempt;
    Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.

JULIET

    If they do see thee, they will murder thee.

ROMEO

    Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
    Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
    And I am proof against their enmity.

JULIET

    I would not for the world they saw thee here.

ROMEO

    I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
    And but thou love me, let them find me here:
    My life were better ended by their hate,
    Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.

JULIET

    By whose direction found'st thou out this place?

ROMEO

    By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
    He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
    I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
    As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
    I would adventure for such merchandise.

JULIET

    Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
    Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
    For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
    Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
    What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
    Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
    And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
    Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
    Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
    If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
    Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
    I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
    So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
    In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
    And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
    But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
    Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
    I should have been more strange, I must confess,
    But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
    My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
    And not impute this yielding to light love,
    Which the dark night hath so discovered.

ROMEO

    Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
    That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--

JULIET

    O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
    That monthly changes in her circled orb,
    Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.

ROMEO

    What shall I swear by?

JULIET

    Do not swear at all;
    Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
    Which is the god of my idolatry,
    And I'll believe thee.

ROMEO

    If my heart's dear love--

JULIET

    Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
    I have no joy of this contract to-night:
    It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
    Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
    Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
    This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
    May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
    Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
    Come to thy heart as that within my breast!

ROMEO

    O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

JULIET

    What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?

ROMEO

    The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

JULIET

    I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
    And yet I would it were to give again.

ROMEO

    Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?

JULIET

    But to be frank, and give it thee again.
    And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
    My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
    My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
    The more I have, for both are infinite.

    Nurse calls within
    I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
    Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
    Stay but a little, I will come again.

    Exit, above

ROMEO

    O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
    Being in night, all this is but a dream,
    Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.

    Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET

    Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
    If that thy bent of love be honourable,
    Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
    By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
    Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
    And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
    And follow thee my lord throughout the world.

Nurse

    [Within] Madam!

JULIET

    I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
    I do beseech thee--

Nurse

    [Within] Madam!

JULIET

    By and by, I come:--
    To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
    To-morrow will I send.

ROMEO

    So thrive my soul--

JULIET

    A thousand times good night!

    Exit, above

ROMEO

    A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
    Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
    their books,
    But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.

    Retiring

    Re-enter JULIET, above

JULIET

    Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
    To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
    Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
    Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
    And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
    With repetition of my Romeo's name.

ROMEO

    It is my soul that calls upon my name:
    How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
    Like softest music to attending ears!

JULIET

    Romeo!

ROMEO

    My dear?

JULIET

    At what o'clock to-morrow
    Shall I send to thee?

ROMEO

    At the hour of nine.

JULIET

    I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
    I have forgot why I did call thee back.

ROMEO

    Let me stand here till thou remember it.

JULIET

    I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
    Remembering how I love thy company.

ROMEO

    And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
    Forgetting any other home but this.

JULIET

    'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
    And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
    Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
    Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
    And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
    So loving-jealous of his liberty.

ROMEO

    I would I were thy bird.

JULIET

    Sweet, so would I:
    Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
    Good night, good night! parting is such
    sweet sorrow,
    That I shall say good night till it be morrow.

    Exit above

ROMEO

    Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
    Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
    Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
    His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

    Exit

SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket

FRIAR LAURENCE

    The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
    Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
    And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
    From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
    Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
    The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
    I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
    With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
    The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
    What is her burying grave that is her womb,
    And from her womb children of divers kind
    We sucking on her natural bosom find,
    Many for many virtues excellent,
    None but for some and yet all different.
    O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
    In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
    For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
    But to the earth some special good doth give,
    Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
    Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
    Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
    And vice sometimes by action dignified.
    Within the infant rind of this small flower
    Poison hath residence and medicine power:
    For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
    Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
    Two such opposed kings encamp them still
    In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
    And where the worser is predominant,
    Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.

    Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

    Good morrow, father.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Benedicite!
    What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
    Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
    So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
    Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
    And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
    But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
    Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
    Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
    Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
    Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
    Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.

ROMEO

    That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?

ROMEO

    With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
    I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?

ROMEO

    I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
    I have been feasting with mine enemy,
    Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
    That's by me wounded: both our remedies
    Within thy help and holy physic lies:
    I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
    My intercession likewise steads my foe.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
    Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.

ROMEO

    Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
    On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
    As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
    And all combined, save what thou must combine
    By holy marriage: when and where and how
    We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
    I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
    That thou consent to marry us to-day.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
    Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
    So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
    Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
    Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
    Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
    How much salt water thrown away in waste,
    To season love, that of it doth not taste!
    The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
    Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
    Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
    Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
    If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
    Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
    And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
    Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.

ROMEO

    Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.

ROMEO

    And bad'st me bury love.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Not in a grave,
    To lay one in, another out to have.

ROMEO

    I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
    Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
    The other did not so.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    O, she knew well
    Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
    But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
    In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
    For this alliance may so happy prove,
    To turn your households' rancour to pure love.

ROMEO

    O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A street.

    Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO

MERCUTIO

    Where the devil should this Romeo be?
    Came he not home to-night?

BENVOLIO

    Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.

MERCUTIO

    Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
    Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.

BENVOLIO

    Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
    Hath sent a letter to his father's house.

MERCUTIO

    A challenge, on my life.

BENVOLIO

    Romeo will answer it.

MERCUTIO

    Any man that can write may answer a letter.

BENVOLIO

    Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
    dares, being dared.

MERCUTIO

    Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
    white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
    love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
    blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
    encounter Tybalt?

BENVOLIO

    Why, what is Tybalt?

MERCUTIO

    More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
    the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
    you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
    proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
    the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
    button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
    very first house, of the first and second cause:
    ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
    hai!

BENVOLIO

    The what?

MERCUTIO

    The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
    fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
    a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
    whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
    grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
    these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
    perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
    that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
    bones, their bones!

    Enter ROMEO

BENVOLIO

    Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.

MERCUTIO

    Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
    how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
    that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
    kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
    be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
    Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
    eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
    Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
    to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
    fairly last night.

ROMEO

    Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?

MERCUTIO

    The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?

ROMEO

    Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
    such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.

MERCUTIO

    That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
    constrains a man to bow in the hams.

ROMEO

    Meaning, to court'sy.

MERCUTIO

    Thou hast most kindly hit it.

ROMEO

    A most courteous exposition.

MERCUTIO

    Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.

ROMEO

    Pink for flower.

MERCUTIO

    Right.

ROMEO

    Why, then is my pump well flowered.

MERCUTIO

    Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
    worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
    is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.

ROMEO

    O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
    singleness.

MERCUTIO

    Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.

ROMEO

    Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.

MERCUTIO

    Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
    done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
    thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
    was I with you there for the goose?

ROMEO

    Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
    not there for the goose.

MERCUTIO

    I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.

ROMEO

    Nay, good goose, bite not.

MERCUTIO

    Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
    sharp sauce.

ROMEO

    And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?

MERCUTIO

    O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
    inch narrow to an ell broad!

ROMEO

    I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
    to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.

MERCUTIO

    Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
    now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
    thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
    for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
    that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.

BENVOLIO

    Stop there, stop there.

MERCUTIO

    Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.

BENVOLIO

    Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.

MERCUTIO

    O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
    for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
    meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.

ROMEO

    Here's goodly gear!

    Enter Nurse and PETER

MERCUTIO

    A sail, a sail!

BENVOLIO

    Two, two; a shirt and a smock.

Nurse

    Peter!

PETER

    Anon!

Nurse

    My fan, Peter.

MERCUTIO

    Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
    fairer face.

Nurse

    God ye good morrow, gentlemen.

MERCUTIO

    God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.

Nurse

    Is it good den?

MERCUTIO

    'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
    dial is now upon the prick of noon.

Nurse

    Out upon you! what a man are you!

ROMEO

    One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
    mar.

Nurse

    By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
    quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
    may find the young Romeo?

ROMEO

    I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
    you have found him than he was when you sought him:
    I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.

Nurse

    You say well.

MERCUTIO

    Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
    wisely, wisely.

Nurse

    if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
    you.

BENVOLIO

    She will indite him to some supper.

MERCUTIO

    A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!

ROMEO

    What hast thou found?

MERCUTIO

    No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
    that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.

    Sings
    An old hare hoar,
    And an old hare hoar,
    Is very good meat in lent
    But a hare that is hoar
    Is too much for a score,
    When it hoars ere it be spent.
    Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
    to dinner, thither.

ROMEO

    I will follow you.

MERCUTIO

    Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,

    Singing
    'lady, lady, lady.'

    Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

Nurse

    Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
    merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?

ROMEO

    A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
    and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
    to in a month.

Nurse

    An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
    down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
    Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
    Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
    none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
    too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?

PETER

    I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
    should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
    draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
    good quarrel, and the law on my side.

Nurse

    Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
    me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
    and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
    out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
    but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
    a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
    kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
    is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
    with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
    to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.

ROMEO

    Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
    protest unto thee--

Nurse

    Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
    Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.

ROMEO

    What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.

Nurse

    I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
    I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.

ROMEO

    Bid her devise
    Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
    And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
    Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.

Nurse

    No truly sir; not a penny.

ROMEO

    Go to; I say you shall.

Nurse

    This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.

ROMEO

    And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
    Within this hour my man shall be with thee
    And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
    Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
    Must be my convoy in the secret night.
    Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
    Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.

Nurse

    Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.

ROMEO

    What say'st thou, my dear nurse?

Nurse

    Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
    Two may keep counsel, putting one away?

ROMEO

    I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.

NURSE

    Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
    Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
    is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
    lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
    see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
    sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
    man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
    as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
    rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?

ROMEO

    Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.

Nurse

    Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
    the--No; I know it begins with some other
    letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
    it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
    to hear it.

ROMEO

    Commend me to thy lady.

Nurse

    Ay, a thousand times.

    Exit Romeo
    Peter!

PETER

    Anon!

Nurse

    Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.

    Enter JULIET

JULIET

    The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
    In half an hour she promised to return.
    Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
    O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
    Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
    Driving back shadows over louring hills:
    Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
    And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
    Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
    Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
    Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
    Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    And his to me:
    But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
    Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
    O God, she comes!

    Enter Nurse and PETER
    O honey nurse, what news?
    Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.

Nurse

    Peter, stay at the gate.

    Exit PETER

JULIET

    Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
    Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
    If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
    By playing it to me with so sour a face.

Nurse

    I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
    Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!

JULIET

    I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
    Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.

Nurse

    Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
    Do you not see that I am out of breath?

JULIET

    How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
    To say to me that thou art out of breath?
    The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
    Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
    Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
    Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
    Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?

Nurse

    Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
    how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
    face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
    all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
    though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
    past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
    but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
    ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?

JULIET

    No, no: but all this did I know before.
    What says he of our marriage? what of that?

Nurse

    Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
    It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
    My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
    Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
    To catch my death with jaunting up and down!

JULIET

    I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
    Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?

Nurse

    Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
    courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
    warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?

JULIET

    Where is my mother! why, she is within;
    Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
    'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
    Where is your mother?'

Nurse

    O God's lady dear!
    Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
    Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
    Henceforward do your messages yourself.

JULIET

    Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?

Nurse

    Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?

JULIET

    I have.

Nurse

    Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
    There stays a husband to make you a wife:
    Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
    They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
    Hie you to church; I must another way,
    To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
    Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
    I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
    But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
    Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.

JULIET

    Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

    Exeunt

SCENE VI. Friar Laurence's cell.

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO

FRIAR LAURENCE

    So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
    That after hours with sorrow chide us not!

ROMEO

    Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
    It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
    That one short minute gives me in her sight:
    Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
    Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
    It is enough I may but call her mine.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    These violent delights have violent ends
    And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
    Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
    Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
    And in the taste confounds the appetite:
    Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
    Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.

    Enter JULIET
    Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
    Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
    A lover may bestride the gossamer
    That idles in the wanton summer air,
    And yet not fall; so light is vanity.

JULIET

    Good even to my ghostly confessor.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.

JULIET

    As much to him, else is his thanks too much.

ROMEO

    Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
    Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
    To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
    This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
    Unfold the imagined happiness that both
    Receive in either by this dear encounter.

JULIET

    Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
    Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
    They are but beggars that can count their worth;
    But my true love is grown to such excess
    I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
    For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
    Till holy church incorporate two in one.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A public place.

    Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants

BENVOLIO

    I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
    The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
    And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
    For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.

MERCUTIO

    Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
    enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
    upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
    thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
    it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.

BENVOLIO

    Am I like such a fellow?

MERCUTIO

    Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
    any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
    soon moody to be moved.

BENVOLIO

    And what to?

MERCUTIO

    Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
    shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
    thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
    or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
    wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
    other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
    eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
    Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
    meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
    an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
    man for coughing in the street, because he hath
    wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
    didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
    his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
    tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
    wilt tutor me from quarrelling!

BENVOLIO

    An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
    should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.

MERCUTIO

    The fee-simple! O simple!

BENVOLIO

    By my head, here come the Capulets.

MERCUTIO

    By my heel, I care not.

    Enter TYBALT and others

TYBALT

    Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
    Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.

MERCUTIO

    And but one word with one of us? couple it with
    something; make it a word and a blow.

TYBALT

    You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
    will give me occasion.

MERCUTIO

    Could you not take some occasion without giving?

TYBALT

    Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--

MERCUTIO

    Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
    thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
    discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
    make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!

BENVOLIO

    We talk here in the public haunt of men:
    Either withdraw unto some private place,
    And reason coldly of your grievances,
    Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.

MERCUTIO

    Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
    I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.

    Enter ROMEO

TYBALT

    Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.

MERCUTIO

    But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
    Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
    Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'

TYBALT

    Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
    No better term than this,--thou art a villain.

ROMEO

    Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
    Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
    To such a greeting: villain am I none;
    Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.

TYBALT

    Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
    That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.

ROMEO

    I do protest, I never injured thee,
    But love thee better than thou canst devise,
    Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
    And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
    As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.

MERCUTIO

    O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
    Alla stoccata carries it away.

    Draws
    Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?

TYBALT

    What wouldst thou have with me?

MERCUTIO

    Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
    lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
    shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
    eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
    by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
    ears ere it be out.

TYBALT

    I am for you.

    Drawing

ROMEO

    Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.

MERCUTIO

    Come, sir, your passado.

    They fight

ROMEO

    Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
    Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
    Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
    Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
    Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!

    TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies with his followers

MERCUTIO

    I am hurt.
    A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
    Is he gone, and hath nothing?

BENVOLIO

    What, art thou hurt?

MERCUTIO

    Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
    Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.

    Exit Page

ROMEO

    Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

MERCUTIO

    No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
    church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
    me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
    am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
    both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
    cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
    rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
    arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
    was hurt under your arm.

ROMEO

    I thought all for the best.

MERCUTIO

    Help me into some house, Benvolio,
    Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
    They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
    And soundly too: your houses!

    Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO

ROMEO

    This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
    My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
    In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
    With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
    Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
    Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
    And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!

    Re-enter BENVOLIO

BENVOLIO

    O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
    That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
    Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.

ROMEO

    This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
    This but begins the woe, others must end.

BENVOLIO

    Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.

ROMEO

    Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
    Away to heaven, respective lenity,
    And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!

    Re-enter TYBALT
    Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
    That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
    Is but a little way above our heads,
    Staying for thine to keep him company:
    Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.

TYBALT

    Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
    Shalt with him hence.

ROMEO

    This shall determine that.

    They fight; TYBALT falls

BENVOLIO

    Romeo, away, be gone!
    The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
    Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
    If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!

ROMEO

    O, I am fortune's fool!

BENVOLIO

    Why dost thou stay?

    Exit ROMEO

    Enter Citizens, & c

First Citizen

    Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
    Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?

BENVOLIO

    There lies that Tybalt.

First Citizen

    Up, sir, go with me;
    I charge thee in the princes name, obey.

    Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their Wives, and others

PRINCE

    Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

BENVOLIO

    O noble prince, I can discover all
    The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
    There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
    That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.

LADY CAPULET

    Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
    O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
    O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
    For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
    O cousin, cousin!

PRINCE

    Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?

BENVOLIO

    Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
    Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
    How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
    Your high displeasure: all this uttered
    With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
    Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
    Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
    With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
    Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
    And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
    Cold death aside, and with the other sends
    It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
    Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
    'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
    his tongue,
    His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
    And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
    An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
    Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
    But by and by comes back to Romeo,
    Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
    And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
    Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
    And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
    This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.

LADY CAPULET

    He is a kinsman to the Montague;
    Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
    Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
    And all those twenty could but kill one life.
    I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
    Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.

PRINCE

    Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
    Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?

MONTAGUE

    Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
    His fault concludes but what the law should end,
    The life of Tybalt.

PRINCE

    And for that offence
    Immediately we do exile him hence:
    I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
    My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
    But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
    That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
    I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
    Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
    Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
    Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
    Bear hence this body and attend our will:
    Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Capulet's orchard.

    Enter JULIET

JULIET

    Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
    Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
    As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
    And bring in cloudy night immediately.
    Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
    That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
    Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
    Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
    By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
    It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
    Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
    And learn me how to lose a winning match,
    Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
    Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
    With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
    Think true love acted simple modesty.
    Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
    For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
    Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
    Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
    Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
    Take him and cut him out in little stars,
    And he will make the face of heaven so fine
    That all the world will be in love with night
    And pay no worship to the garish sun.
    O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
    But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
    Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
    As is the night before some festival
    To an impatient child that hath new robes
    And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
    And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
    But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.

    Enter Nurse, with cords
    Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
    That Romeo bid thee fetch?

Nurse

    Ay, ay, the cords.

    Throws them down

JULIET

    Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?

Nurse

    Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
    We are undone, lady, we are undone!
    Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!

JULIET

    Can heaven be so envious?

Nurse

    Romeo can,
    Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
    Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!

JULIET

    What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
    This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
    Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
    And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
    Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
    I am not I, if there be such an I;
    Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
    If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
    Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.

Nurse

    I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
    God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
    A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
    Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
    All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.

JULIET

    O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
    To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
    Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
    And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!

Nurse

    O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
    O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
    That ever I should live to see thee dead!

JULIET

    What storm is this that blows so contrary?
    Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
    My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
    Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
    For who is living, if those two are gone?

Nurse

    Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
    Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.

JULIET

    O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?

Nurse

    It did, it did; alas the day, it did!

JULIET

    O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
    Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
    Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
    Despised substance of divinest show!
    Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
    A damned saint, an honourable villain!
    O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
    When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
    In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
    Was ever book containing such vile matter
    So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
    In such a gorgeous palace!

Nurse

    There's no trust,
    No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
    All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
    Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
    These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
    Shame come to Romeo!

JULIET

    Blister'd be thy tongue
    For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
    Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
    For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
    Sole monarch of the universal earth.
    O, what a beast was I to chide at him!

Nurse

    Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?

JULIET

    Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
    Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
    When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
    But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
    That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
    Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
    Your tributary drops belong to woe,
    Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
    My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
    And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
    All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
    Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
    That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
    But, O, it presses to my memory,
    Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
    'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
    That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
    Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
    Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
    Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
    And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
    Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
    Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
    Which modern lamentations might have moved?
    But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
    'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
    Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
    All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
    There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
    In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
    Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?

Nurse

    Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
    Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.

JULIET

    Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
    When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
    Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
    Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
    He made you for a highway to my bed;
    But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
    Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
    And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!

Nurse

    Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
    To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
    Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
    I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.

JULIET

    O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
    And bid him come to take his last farewell.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Friar Laurence's cell.

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
    Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
    And thou art wedded to calamity.

    Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

    Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
    What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
    That I yet know not?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Too familiar
    Is my dear son with such sour company:
    I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.

ROMEO

    What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
    Not body's death, but body's banishment.

ROMEO

    Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
    For exile hath more terror in his look,
    Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hence from Verona art thou banished:
    Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.

ROMEO

    There is no world without Verona walls,
    But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
    Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
    And world's exile is death: then banished,
    Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
    Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
    And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
    Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
    Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
    And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
    This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.

ROMEO

    'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
    Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
    And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
    Live here in heaven and may look on her;
    But Romeo may not: more validity,
    More honourable state, more courtship lives
    In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
    On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
    And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
    Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
    Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
    But Romeo may not; he is banished:
    Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
    They are free men, but I am banished.
    And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
    Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
    No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
    But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
    O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
    Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
    Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
    A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
    To mangle me with that word 'banished'?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.

ROMEO

    O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
    Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
    To comfort thee, though thou art banished.

ROMEO

    Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
    Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
    Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
    It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    O, then I see that madmen have no ears.

ROMEO

    How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.

ROMEO

    Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
    Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
    An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
    Doting like me and like me banished,
    Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
    And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
    Taking the measure of an unmade grave.

    Knocking within

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.

ROMEO

    Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
    Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.

    Knocking

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
    Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;

    Knocking
    Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
    What simpleness is this! I come, I come!

    Knocking
    Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?

Nurse

    [Within] Let me come in, and you shall know
    my errand;
    I come from Lady Juliet.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Welcome, then.

    Enter Nurse

Nurse

    O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
    Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.

Nurse

    O, he is even in my mistress' case,
    Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
    Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
    Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
    Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
    For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
    Why should you fall into so deep an O?

ROMEO

    Nurse!

Nurse

    Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.

ROMEO

    Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
    Doth she not think me an old murderer,
    Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
    With blood removed but little from her own?
    Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
    My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?

Nurse

    O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
    And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
    And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
    And then down falls again.

ROMEO

    As if that name,
    Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
    Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
    Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
    In what vile part of this anatomy
    Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
    The hateful mansion.

    Drawing his sword

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hold thy desperate hand:
    Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
    Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
    The unreasonable fury of a beast:
    Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
    Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
    Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
    I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
    Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
    And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
    By doing damned hate upon thyself?
    Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
    Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
    In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
    Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
    Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
    And usest none in that true use indeed
    Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
    Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
    Digressing from the valour of a man;
    Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
    Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
    Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
    Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
    Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
    Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
    And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
    What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
    For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
    There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
    But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
    The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
    And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
    A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
    Happiness courts thee in her best array;
    But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
    Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
    Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
    Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
    Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
    But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
    For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
    Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
    To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
    Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
    With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
    Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
    Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
    And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
    Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
    Romeo is coming.

Nurse

    O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
    To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
    My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.

ROMEO

    Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.

Nurse

    Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
    Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.

    Exit

ROMEO

    How well my comfort is revived by this!

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
    Either be gone before the watch be set,
    Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
    Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
    And he shall signify from time to time
    Every good hap to you that chances here:
    Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.

ROMEO

    But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
    It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. A room in Capulet's house.

    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS

CAPULET

    Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
    That we have had no time to move our daughter:
    Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
    And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
    'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
    I promise you, but for your company,
    I would have been a-bed an hour ago.

PARIS

    These times of woe afford no time to woo.
    Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.

LADY CAPULET

    I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
    To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.

CAPULET

    Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
    Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
    In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
    Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
    Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
    And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
    But, soft! what day is this?

PARIS

    Monday, my lord,

CAPULET

    Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
    O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
    She shall be married to this noble earl.
    Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
    We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
    For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
    It may be thought we held him carelessly,
    Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
    Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
    And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?

PARIS

    My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.

CAPULET

    Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
    Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
    Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
    Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
    Afore me! it is so very very late,
    That we may call it early by and by.
    Good night.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Capulet's orchard.

    Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window

JULIET

    Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
    It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
    That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
    Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
    Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.

ROMEO

    It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
    No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
    Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
    Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
    Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
    I must be gone and live, or stay and die.

JULIET

    Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
    It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
    To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
    And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
    Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.

ROMEO

    Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
    I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
    I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
    'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
    Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
    The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
    I have more care to stay than will to go:
    Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
    How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.

JULIET

    It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
    It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
    Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
    Some say the lark makes sweet division;
    This doth not so, for she divideth us:
    Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
    O, now I would they had changed voices too!
    Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
    Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
    O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.

ROMEO

    More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!

    Enter Nurse, to the chamber

Nurse

    Madam!

JULIET

    Nurse?

Nurse

    Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
    The day is broke; be wary, look about.

    Exit

JULIET

    Then, window, let day in, and let life out.

ROMEO

    Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.

    He goeth down

JULIET

    Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
    I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
    For in a minute there are many days:
    O, by this count I shall be much in years
    Ere I again behold my Romeo!

ROMEO

    Farewell!
    I will omit no opportunity
    That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.

JULIET

    O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

ROMEO

    I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
    For sweet discourses in our time to come.

JULIET

    O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
    Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
    As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
    Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

ROMEO

    And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
    Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!

    Exit

JULIET

    O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
    If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
    That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
    For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
    But send him back.

LADY CAPULET

    [Within] Ho, daughter! are you up?

JULIET

    Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
    Is she not down so late, or up so early?
    What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?

    Enter LADY CAPULET

LADY CAPULET

    Why, how now, Juliet!

JULIET

    Madam, I am not well.

LADY CAPULET

    Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
    What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
    An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
    Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
    But much of grief shows still some want of wit.

JULIET

    Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.

LADY CAPULET

    So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
    Which you weep for.

JULIET

    Feeling so the loss,
    Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.

LADY CAPULET

    Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
    As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.

JULIET

    What villain madam?

LADY CAPULET

    That same villain, Romeo.

JULIET

    [Aside] Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
    God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
    And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.

LADY CAPULET

    That is, because the traitor murderer lives.

JULIET

    Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
    Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!

LADY CAPULET

    We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
    Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
    Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
    Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
    That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
    And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.

JULIET

    Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
    With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
    Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
    Madam, if you could find out but a man
    To bear a poison, I would temper it;
    That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
    Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
    To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
    To wreak the love I bore my cousin
    Upon his body that slaughter'd him!

LADY CAPULET

    Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
    But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.

JULIET

    And joy comes well in such a needy time:
    What are they, I beseech your ladyship?

LADY CAPULET

    Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
    One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
    Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
    That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.

JULIET

    Madam, in happy time, what day is that?

LADY CAPULET

    Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
    The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
    The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
    Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.

JULIET

    Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
    He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
    I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
    Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
    I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
    I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
    It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
    Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!

LADY CAPULET

    Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
    And see how he will take it at your hands.

    Enter CAPULET and Nurse

CAPULET

    When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
    But for the sunset of my brother's son
    It rains downright.
    How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
    Evermore showering? In one little body
    Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
    For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
    Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
    Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
    Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
    Without a sudden calm, will overset
    Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
    Have you deliver'd to her our decree?

LADY CAPULET

    Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
    I would the fool were married to her grave!

CAPULET

    Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
    How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
    Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
    Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
    So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?

JULIET

    Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
    Proud can I never be of what I hate;
    But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.

CAPULET

    How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
    'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
    And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
    Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
    But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
    To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
    Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
    Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
    You tallow-face!

LADY CAPULET

    Fie, fie! what, are you mad?

JULIET

    Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
    Hear me with patience but to speak a word.

CAPULET

    Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
    I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
    Or never after look me in the face:
    Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
    My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
    That God had lent us but this only child;
    But now I see this one is one too much,
    And that we have a curse in having her:
    Out on her, hilding!

Nurse

    God in heaven bless her!
    You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.

CAPULET

    And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
    Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.

Nurse

    I speak no treason.

CAPULET

    O, God ye god-den.

Nurse

    May not one speak?

CAPULET

    Peace, you mumbling fool!
    Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
    For here we need it not.

LADY CAPULET

    You are too hot.

CAPULET

    God's bread! it makes me mad:
    Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
    Alone, in company, still my care hath been
    To have her match'd: and having now provided
    A gentleman of noble parentage,
    Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
    Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
    Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
    And then to have a wretched puling fool,
    A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
    To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
    I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
    But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
    Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
    Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
    Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
    An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
    And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
    the streets,
    For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
    Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
    Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.

    Exit

JULIET

    Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
    That sees into the bottom of my grief?
    O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
    Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
    Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
    In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.

LADY CAPULET

    Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
    Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.

    Exit

JULIET

    O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
    My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
    How shall that faith return again to earth,
    Unless that husband send it me from heaven
    By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
    Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
    Upon so soft a subject as myself!
    What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
    Some comfort, nurse.

Nurse

    Faith, here it is.
    Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
    That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
    Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
    Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
    I think it best you married with the county.
    O, he's a lovely gentleman!
    Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
    Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
    As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
    I think you are happy in this second match,
    For it excels your first: or if it did not,
    Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
    As living here and you no use of him.

JULIET

    Speakest thou from thy heart?

Nurse

    And from my soul too;
    Or else beshrew them both.

JULIET

    Amen!

Nurse

    What?

JULIET

    Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
    Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
    Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
    To make confession and to be absolved.

Nurse

    Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.

    Exit

JULIET

    Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
    Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
    Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
    Which she hath praised him with above compare
    So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
    Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
    I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
    If all else fail, myself have power to die.

    Exit

ACT IV
SCENE I. Friar Laurence's cell.

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS

FRIAR LAURENCE

    On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.

PARIS

    My father Capulet will have it so;
    And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    You say you do not know the lady's mind:
    Uneven is the course, I like it not.

PARIS

    Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
    And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
    For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
    Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
    That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
    And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
    To stop the inundation of her tears;
    Which, too much minded by herself alone,
    May be put from her by society:
    Now do you know the reason of this haste.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    [Aside] I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
    Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.

    Enter JULIET

PARIS

    Happily met, my lady and my wife!

JULIET

    That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.

PARIS

    That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.

JULIET

    What must be shall be.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    That's a certain text.

PARIS

    Come you to make confession to this father?

JULIET

    To answer that, I should confess to you.

PARIS

    Do not deny to him that you love me.

JULIET

    I will confess to you that I love him.

PARIS

    So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.

JULIET

    If I do so, it will be of more price,
    Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.

PARIS

    Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.

JULIET

    The tears have got small victory by that;
    For it was bad enough before their spite.

PARIS

    Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.

JULIET

    That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
    And what I spake, I spake it to my face.

PARIS

    Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.

JULIET

    It may be so, for it is not mine own.
    Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
    Or shall I come to you at evening mass?

FRIAR LAURENCE

    My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
    My lord, we must entreat the time alone.

PARIS

    God shield I should disturb devotion!
    Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
    Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.

    Exit

JULIET

    O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
    Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
    It strains me past the compass of my wits:
    I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
    On Thursday next be married to this county.

JULIET

    Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
    Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
    If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
    Do thou but call my resolution wise,
    And with this knife I'll help it presently.
    God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
    And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
    Shall be the label to another deed,
    Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
    Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
    Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
    Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
    'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
    Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
    Which the commission of thy years and art
    Could to no issue of true honour bring.
    Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
    If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
    Which craves as desperate an execution.
    As that is desperate which we would prevent.
    If, rather than to marry County Paris,
    Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
    Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
    A thing like death to chide away this shame,
    That copest with death himself to scape from it:
    And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.

JULIET

    O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
    From off the battlements of yonder tower;
    Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
    Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
    Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
    O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
    With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
    Or bid me go into a new-made grave
    And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
    Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
    And I will do it without fear or doubt,
    To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
    To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
    To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
    Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
    Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
    And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
    When presently through all thy veins shall run
    A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
    Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
    No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
    The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
    To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
    Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
    Each part, deprived of supple government,
    Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
    And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
    Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
    And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
    Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
    To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
    Then, as the manner of our country is,
    In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
    Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
    Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
    In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
    Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
    And hither shall he come: and he and I
    Will watch thy waking, and that very night
    Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
    And this shall free thee from this present shame;
    If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
    Abate thy valour in the acting it.

JULIET

    Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
    In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
    To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.

JULIET

    Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
    Farewell, dear father!

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Hall in Capulet's house.

    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, Nurse, and two Servingmen

CAPULET

    So many guests invite as here are writ.

    Exit First Servant
    Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.

Second Servant

    You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
    can lick their fingers.

CAPULET

    How canst thou try them so?

Second Servant

    Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his
    own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his
    fingers goes not with me.

CAPULET

    Go, be gone.

    Exit Second Servant
    We shall be much unfurnished for this time.
    What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?

Nurse

    Ay, forsooth.

CAPULET

    Well, he may chance to do some good on her:
    A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.

Nurse

    See where she comes from shrift with merry look.

    Enter JULIET

CAPULET

    How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?

JULIET

    Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
    Of disobedient opposition
    To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
    By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
    And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
    Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.

CAPULET

    Send for the county; go tell him of this:
    I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.

JULIET

    I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
    And gave him what becomed love I might,
    Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.

CAPULET

    Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
    This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
    Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
    Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
    Our whole city is much bound to him.

JULIET

    Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
    To help me sort such needful ornaments
    As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?

LADY CAPULET

    No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.

CAPULET

    Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.

    Exeunt JULIET and Nurse

LADY CAPULET

    We shall be short in our provision:
    'Tis now near night.

CAPULET

    Tush, I will stir about,
    And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
    Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
    I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
    I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
    They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
    To County Paris, to prepare him up
    Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
    Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. Juliet's chamber.

    Enter JULIET and Nurse

JULIET

    Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
    I pray thee, leave me to my self to-night,
    For I have need of many orisons
    To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
    Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.

    Enter LADY CAPULET

LADY CAPULET

    What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?

JULIET

    No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
    As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
    So please you, let me now be left alone,
    And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
    For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
    In this so sudden business.

LADY CAPULET

    Good night:
    Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.

    Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

JULIET

    Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
    I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
    That almost freezes up the heat of life:
    I'll call them back again to comfort me:
    Nurse! What should she do here?
    My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
    Come, vial.
    What if this mixture do not work at all?
    Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
    No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.

    Laying down her dagger
    What if it be a poison, which the friar
    Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
    Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
    Because he married me before to Romeo?
    I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
    For he hath still been tried a holy man.
    How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
    I wake before the time that Romeo
    Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
    Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
    To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
    And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
    Or, if I live, is it not very like,
    The horrible conceit of death and night,
    Together with the terror of the place,--
    As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
    Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
    Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
    Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
    Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
    At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
    Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
    So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
    And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
    That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
    O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
    Environed with all these hideous fears?
    And madly play with my forefather's joints?
    And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
    And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
    As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
    O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
    Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
    Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
    Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

    She falls upon her bed, within the curtains

SCENE IV. Hall in Capulet's house.

    Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse

LADY CAPULET

    Hold, take these keys, and fetch more spices, nurse.

Nurse

    They call for dates and quinces in the pastry.

    Enter CAPULET

CAPULET

    Come, stir, stir, stir! the second cock hath crow'd,
    The curfew-bell hath rung, 'tis three o'clock:
    Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
    Spare not for the cost.

Nurse

    Go, you cot-quean, go,
    Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
    For this night's watching.

CAPULET

    No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
    All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.

LADY CAPULET

    Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;
    But I will watch you from such watching now.

    Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse

CAPULET

    A jealous hood, a jealous hood!

    Enter three or four Servingmen, with spits, logs, and baskets
    Now, fellow,
    What's there?

First Servant

    Things for the cook, sir; but I know not what.

CAPULET

    Make haste, make haste.

    Exit First Servant
    Sirrah, fetch drier logs:
    Call Peter, he will show thee where they are.

Second Servant

    I have a head, sir, that will find out logs,
    And never trouble Peter for the matter.

    Exit

CAPULET

    Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!
    Thou shalt be logger-head. Good faith, 'tis day:
    The county will be here with music straight,
    For so he said he would: I hear him near.

    Music within
    Nurse! Wife! What, ho! What, nurse, I say!

    Re-enter Nurse
    Go waken Juliet, go and trim her up;
    I'll go and chat with Paris: hie, make haste,
    Make haste; the bridegroom he is come already:
    Make haste, I say.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. Juliet's chamber.

    Enter Nurse

Nurse

    Mistress! what, mistress! Juliet! fast, I warrant her, she:
    Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
    Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
    What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
    Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
    The County Paris hath set up his rest,
    That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
    Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
    I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
    Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
    He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?

    Undraws the curtains
    What, dress'd! and in your clothes! and down again!
    I must needs wake you; Lady! lady! lady!
    Alas, alas! Help, help! my lady's dead!
    O, well-a-day, that ever I was born!
    Some aqua vitae, ho! My lord! my lady!

    Enter LADY CAPULET

LADY CAPULET

    What noise is here?

Nurse

    O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET

    What is the matter?

Nurse

    Look, look! O heavy day!

LADY CAPULET

    O me, O me! My child, my only life,
    Revive, look up, or I will die with thee!
    Help, help! Call help.

    Enter CAPULET

CAPULET

    For shame, bring Juliet forth; her lord is come.

Nurse

    She's dead, deceased, she's dead; alack the day!

LADY CAPULET

    Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!

CAPULET

    Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
    Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
    Life and these lips have long been separated:
    Death lies on her like an untimely frost
    Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.

Nurse

    O lamentable day!

LADY CAPULET

    O woful time!

CAPULET

    Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
    Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS, with Musicians

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Come, is the bride ready to go to church?

CAPULET

    Ready to go, but never to return.
    O son! the night before thy wedding-day
    Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
    Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
    Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
    My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
    And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.

PARIS

    Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
    And doth it give me such a sight as this?

LADY CAPULET

    Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
    Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
    In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
    But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
    But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
    And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!

Nurse

    O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
    Most lamentable day, most woful day,
    That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
    O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
    Never was seen so black a day as this:
    O woful day, O woful day!

PARIS

    Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
    Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
    By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
    O love! O life! not life, but love in death!

CAPULET

    Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
    Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
    To murder, murder our solemnity?
    O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
    Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
    And with my child my joys are buried.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
    In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
    Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
    And all the better is it for the maid:
    Your part in her you could not keep from death,
    But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
    The most you sought was her promotion;
    For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
    And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
    Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
    O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
    That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
    She's not well married that lives married long;
    But she's best married that dies married young.
    Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
    On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
    In all her best array bear her to church:
    For though fond nature bids us an lament,
    Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.

CAPULET

    All things that we ordained festival,
    Turn from their office to black funeral;
    Our instruments to melancholy bells,
    Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
    Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
    Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
    And all things change them to the contrary.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
    And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
    To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
    The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
    Move them no more by crossing their high will.

    Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE

First Musician

    Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.

Nurse

    Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;
    For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.

    Exit

First Musician

    Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.

    Enter PETER

PETER

    Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
    ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'

First Musician

    Why 'Heart's ease?'

PETER

    O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
    heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
    to comfort me.

First Musician

    Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.

PETER

    You will not, then?

First Musician

    No.

PETER

    I will then give it you soundly.

First Musician

    What will you give us?

PETER

    No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
    I will give you the minstrel.

First Musician

    Then I will give you the serving-creature.

PETER

    Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
    your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
    I'll fa you; do you note me?

First Musician

    An you re us and fa us, you note us.

Second Musician

    Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.

PETER

    Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
    with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
    me like men:
    'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
    And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
    Then music with her silver sound'--
    why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
    sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?

Musician

    Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.

PETER

    Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?

Second Musician

    I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.

PETER

    Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?

Third Musician

    Faith, I know not what to say.

PETER

    O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
    for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
    because musicians have no gold for sounding:
    'Then music with her silver sound
    With speedy help doth lend redress.'

    Exit

First Musician

    What a pestilent knave is this same!

Second Musician

    Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the
    mourners, and stay dinner.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Mantua. A street.

    Enter ROMEO

ROMEO

    If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
    My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
    My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
    And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
    Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
    I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
    Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
    to think!--
    And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
    That I revived, and was an emperor.
    Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
    When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!

    Enter BALTHASAR, booted
    News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
    Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
    How doth my lady? Is my father well?
    How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
    For nothing can be ill, if she be well.

BALTHASAR

    Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
    Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
    And her immortal part with angels lives.
    I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
    And presently took post to tell it you:
    O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
    Since you did leave it for my office, sir.

ROMEO

    Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
    Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
    And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.

BALTHASAR

    I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
    Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
    Some misadventure.

ROMEO

    Tush, thou art deceived:
    Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
    Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?

BALTHASAR

    No, my good lord.

ROMEO

    No matter: get thee gone,
    And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.

    Exit BALTHASAR
    Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
    Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
    To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
    I do remember an apothecary,--
    And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
    In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
    Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
    Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
    And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
    An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
    Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
    A beggarly account of empty boxes,
    Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
    Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
    Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
    Noting this penury, to myself I said
    'An if a man did need a poison now,
    Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
    Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
    O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
    And this same needy man must sell it me.
    As I remember, this should be the house.
    Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
    What, ho! apothecary!

    Enter Apothecary

Apothecary

    Who calls so loud?

ROMEO

    Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
    Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
    A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
    As will disperse itself through all the veins
    That the life-weary taker may fall dead
    And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
    As violently as hasty powder fired
    Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.

Apothecary

    Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
    Is death to any he that utters them.

ROMEO

    Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
    And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
    Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
    Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
    The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
    The world affords no law to make thee rich;
    Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.

Apothecary

    My poverty, but not my will, consents.

ROMEO

    I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.

Apothecary

    Put this in any liquid thing you will,
    And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
    Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.

ROMEO

    There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
    Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
    Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
    I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
    Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
    Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
    To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Friar Laurence's cell.

    Enter FRIAR JOHN

FRIAR JOHN

    Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!

    Enter FRIAR LAURENCE

FRIAR LAURENCE

    This same should be the voice of Friar John.
    Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
    Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

FRIAR JOHN

    Going to find a bare-foot brother out
    One of our order, to associate me,
    Here in this city visiting the sick,
    And finding him, the searchers of the town,
    Suspecting that we both were in a house
    Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
    Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
    So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?

FRIAR JOHN

    I could not send it,--here it is again,--
    Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
    So fearful were they of infection.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
    The letter was not nice but full of charge
    Of dear import, and the neglecting it
    May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
    Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
    Unto my cell.

FRIAR JOHN

    Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.

    Exit

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Now must I to the monument alone;
    Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
    She will beshrew me much that Romeo
    Hath had no notice of these accidents;
    But I will write again to Mantua,
    And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
    Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!

    Exit

SCENE III. A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.

    Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch

PARIS

    Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
    Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
    Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
    Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
    So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
    Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
    But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
    As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
    Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.

PAGE

    [Aside] I am almost afraid to stand alone
    Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.

    Retires

PARIS

    Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
    O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
    Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
    Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
    The obsequies that I for thee will keep
    Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.

    The Page whistles
    The boy gives warning something doth approach.
    What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
    To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
    What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.

    Retires

    Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch, mattock, & c

ROMEO

    Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
    Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
    See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
    Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
    Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
    And do not interrupt me in my course.
    Why I descend into this bed of death,
    Is partly to behold my lady's face;
    But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
    A precious ring, a ring that I must use
    In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
    But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
    In what I further shall intend to do,
    By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
    And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
    The time and my intents are savage-wild,
    More fierce and more inexorable far
    Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.

BALTHASAR

    I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.

ROMEO

    So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
    Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.

BALTHASAR

    [Aside] For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
    His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.

    Retires

ROMEO

    Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
    Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
    Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
    And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!

    Opens the tomb

PARIS

    This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
    That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
    It is supposed, the fair creature died;
    And here is come to do some villanous shame
    To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.

    Comes forward
    Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
    Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
    Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
    Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.

ROMEO

    I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
    Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
    Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
    Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
    Put not another sin upon my head,
    By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
    By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
    For I come hither arm'd against myself:
    Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
    A madman's mercy bade thee run away.

PARIS

    I do defy thy conjurations,
    And apprehend thee for a felon here.

ROMEO

    Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!

    They fight

PAGE

    O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.

    Exit

PARIS

    O, I am slain!

    Falls
    If thou be merciful,
    Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.

    Dies

ROMEO

    In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
    Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
    What said my man, when my betossed soul
    Did not attend him as we rode? I think
    He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
    Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
    Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
    To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
    One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
    I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
    A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
    For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
    This vault a feasting presence full of light.
    Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.

    Laying PARIS in the tomb
    How oft when men are at the point of death
    Have they been merry! which their keepers call
    A lightning before death: O, how may I
    Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
    Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
    Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
    Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
    Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
    And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
    Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
    O, what more favour can I do to thee,
    Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
    To sunder his that was thine enemy?
    Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
    Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
    That unsubstantial death is amorous,
    And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
    Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
    For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
    And never from this palace of dim night
    Depart again: here, here will I remain
    With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
    Will I set up my everlasting rest,
    And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
    From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
    Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
    The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
    A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
    Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
    Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
    The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
    Here's to my love!

    Drinks
    O true apothecary!
    Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.

    Dies

    Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
    Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?

BALTHASAR

    Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
    What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
    To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
    It burneth in the Capel's monument.

BALTHASAR

    It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
    One that you love.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Who is it?

BALTHASAR

    Romeo.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    How long hath he been there?

BALTHASAR

    Full half an hour.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Go with me to the vault.

BALTHASAR

    I dare not, sir
    My master knows not but I am gone hence;
    And fearfully did menace me with death,
    If I did stay to look on his intents.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
    O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.

BALTHASAR

    As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
    I dreamt my master and another fought,
    And that my master slew him.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    Romeo!

    Advances
    Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
    The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
    What mean these masterless and gory swords
    To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?

    Enters the tomb
    Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
    And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
    Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
    The lady stirs.

    JULIET wakes

JULIET

    O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
    I do remember well where I should be,
    And there I am. Where is my Romeo?

    Noise within

FRIAR LAURENCE

    I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
    Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
    A greater power than we can contradict
    Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
    Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
    And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
    Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
    Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
    Come, go, good Juliet,

    Noise again
    I dare no longer stay.

JULIET

    Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.

    Exit FRIAR LAURENCE
    What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
    Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
    O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
    To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
    Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
    To make die with a restorative.

    Kisses him
    Thy lips are warm.

First Watchman

    [Within] Lead, boy: which way?

JULIET

    Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!

    Snatching ROMEO's dagger
    This is thy sheath;

    Stabs herself
    there rust, and let me die.

    Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies

    Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS

PAGE

    This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.

First Watchman

    The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
    Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
    Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
    And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
    Who here hath lain these two days buried.
    Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
    Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
    We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
    But the true ground of all these piteous woes
    We cannot without circumstance descry.

    Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR

Second Watchman

    Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.

First Watchman

    Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.

    Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE

Third Watchman

    Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
    We took this mattock and this spade from him,
    As he was coming from this churchyard side.

First Watchman

    A great suspicion: stay the friar too.

    Enter the PRINCE and Attendants

PRINCE

    What misadventure is so early up,
    That calls our person from our morning's rest?

    Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others

CAPULET

    What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?

LADY CAPULET

    The people in the street cry Romeo,
    Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
    With open outcry toward our monument.

PRINCE

    What fear is this which startles in our ears?

First Watchman

    Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
    And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
    Warm and new kill'd.

PRINCE

    Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.

First Watchman

    Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
    With instruments upon them, fit to open
    These dead men's tombs.

CAPULET

    O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
    This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
    Is empty on the back of Montague,--
    And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!

LADY CAPULET

    O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
    That warns my old age to a sepulchre.

    Enter MONTAGUE and others

PRINCE

    Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
    To see thy son and heir more early down.

MONTAGUE

    Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
    Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
    What further woe conspires against mine age?

PRINCE

    Look, and thou shalt see.

MONTAGUE

    O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
    To press before thy father to a grave?

PRINCE

    Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
    Till we can clear these ambiguities,
    And know their spring, their head, their
    true descent;
    And then will I be general of your woes,
    And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
    And let mischance be slave to patience.
    Bring forth the parties of suspicion.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    I am the greatest, able to do least,
    Yet most suspected, as the time and place
    Doth make against me of this direful murder;
    And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
    Myself condemned and myself excused.

PRINCE

    Then say at once what thou dost know in this.

FRIAR LAURENCE

    I will be brief, for my short date of breath
    Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
    Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
    And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
    I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
    Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
    Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
    For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
    You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
    Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
    To County Paris: then comes she to me,
    And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
    To rid her from this second marriage,
    Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
    A sleeping potion; which so took effect
    As I intended, for it wrought on her
    The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
    That he should hither come as this dire night,
    To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
    Being the time the potion's force should cease.
    But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
    Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
    At the prefixed hour of her waking,
    Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
    Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
    Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
    But when I came, some minute ere the time
    Of her awaking, here untimely lay
    The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
    She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
    And bear this work of heaven with patience:
    But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
    And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
    But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
    All this I know; and to the marriage
    Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
    Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
    Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
    Unto the rigour of severest law.

PRINCE

    We still have known thee for a holy man.
    Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?

BALTHASAR

    I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
    And then in post he came from Mantua
    To this same place, to this same monument.
    This letter he early bid me give his father,
    And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
    I departed not and left him there.

PRINCE

    Give me the letter; I will look on it.
    Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
    Sirrah, what made your master in this place?

PAGE

    He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
    And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
    Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
    And by and by my master drew on him;
    And then I ran away to call the watch.

PRINCE

    This letter doth make good the friar's words,
    Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
    And here he writes that he did buy a poison
    Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
    Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
    Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
    See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
    That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
    And I for winking at your discords too
    Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.

CAPULET

    O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
    This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
    Can I demand.

MONTAGUE

    But I can give thee more:
    For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
    That while Verona by that name is known,
    There shall no figure at such rate be set
    As that of true and faithful Juliet.

CAPULET

    As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
    Poor sacrifices of our enmity!

PRINCE

    A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
    The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
    Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
    Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
    For never was a story of more woe
    Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

    Exeunt


Timon of Athens

ACT I
SCENE I. Athens. A hall in Timon's house.

    Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and others, at several doors

Poet

    Good day, sir.

Painter

    I am glad you're well.

Poet

    I have not seen you long: how goes the world?

Painter

    It wears, sir, as it grows.

Poet

    Ay, that's well known:
    But what particular rarity? what strange,
    Which manifold record not matches? See,
    Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power
    Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.

Painter

    I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.

Merchant

    O, 'tis a worthy lord.

Jeweller

    Nay, that's most fix'd.

Merchant

    A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,
    To an untirable and continuate goodness:
    He passes.
    Jeweller: I have a jewel here--

Merchant

    O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?
    Jeweller: If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--

Poet

    [Reciting to himself] 'When we for recompense have
    praised the vile,
    It stains the glory in that happy verse
    Which aptly sings the good.'

Merchant

    'Tis a good form.

    Looking at the jewel

Jeweller

    And rich: here is a water, look ye.

Painter

    You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
    To the great lord.

Poet

    A thing slipp'd idly from me.
    Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
    From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
    Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
    Provokes itself and like the current flies
    Each bound it chafes. What have you there?

Painter

    A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?

Poet

    Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
    Let's see your piece.

Painter

    'Tis a good piece.

Poet

    So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.

Painter

    Indifferent.

Poet

    Admirable: how this grace
    Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
    This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
    Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture
    One might interpret.

Painter

    It is a pretty mocking of the life.
    Here is a touch; is't good?

Poet

    I will say of it,
    It tutors nature: artificial strife
    Lives in these touches, livelier than life.

    Enter certain Senators, and pass over

Painter

    How this lord is follow'd!

Poet

    The senators of Athens: happy man!

Painter

    Look, more!

Poet

    You see this confluence, this great flood
    of visitors.
    I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,
    Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
    With amplest entertainment: my free drift
    Halts not particularly, but moves itself
    In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
    Infects one comma in the course I hold;
    But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
    Leaving no tract behind.

Painter

    How shall I understand you?

Poet

    I will unbolt to you.
    You see how all conditions, how all minds,
    As well of glib and slippery creatures as
    Of grave and austere quality, tender down
    Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
    Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
    Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
    All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer
    To Apemantus, that few things loves better
    Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
    The knee before him, and returns in peace
    Most rich in Timon's nod.

Painter

    I saw them speak together.

Poet

    Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
    Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount
    Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,
    That labour on the bosom of this sphere
    To propagate their states: amongst them all,
    Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,
    One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
    Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
    Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
    Translates his rivals.

Painter

    'Tis conceived to scope.
    This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
    With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
    Bowing his head against the sleepy mount
    To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
    In our condition.

Poet

    Nay, sir, but hear me on.
    All those which were his fellows but of late,
    Some better than his value, on the moment
    Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
    Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
    Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
    Drink the free air.

Painter

    Ay, marry, what of these?

Poet

    When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
    Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants
    Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
    Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
    Not one accompanying his declining foot.

Painter

    'Tis common:
    A thousand moral paintings I can show
    That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
    More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
    To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
    The foot above the head.

    Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other servants following

TIMON

    Imprison'd is he, say you?

Messenger

    Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,
    His means most short, his creditors most strait:
    Your honourable letter he desires
    To those have shut him up; which failing,
    Periods his comfort.

TIMON

    Noble Ventidius! Well;
    I am not of that feather to shake off
    My friend when he must need me. I do know him
    A gentleman that well deserves a help:
    Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,
    and free him.

Messenger

    Your lordship ever binds him.

TIMON

    Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;
    And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.
    'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
    But to support him after. Fare you well.

Messenger

    All happiness to your honour!

    Exit

    Enter an old Athenian

Old Athenian

    Lord Timon, hear me speak.

TIMON

    Freely, good father.

Old Athenian

    Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.

TIMON

    I have so: what of him?

Old Athenian

    Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.

TIMON

    Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!

LUCILIUS

    Here, at your lordship's service.

Old Athenian

    This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
    By night frequents my house. I am a man
    That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
    And my estate deserves an heir more raised
    Than one which holds a trencher.

TIMON

    Well; what further?

Old Athenian

    One only daughter have I, no kin else,
    On whom I may confer what I have got:
    The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,
    And I have bred her at my dearest cost
    In qualities of the best. This man of thine
    Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,
    Join with me to forbid him her resort;
    Myself have spoke in vain.

TIMON

    The man is honest.

Old Athenian

    Therefore he will be, Timon:
    His honesty rewards him in itself;
    It must not bear my daughter.

TIMON

    Does she love him?

Old Athenian

    She is young and apt:
    Our own precedent passions do instruct us
    What levity's in youth.

TIMON

    [To LUCILIUS] Love you the maid?

LUCILIUS

    Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.

Old Athenian

    If in her marriage my consent be missing,
    I call the gods to witness, I will choose
    Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
    And dispossess her all.

TIMON

    How shall she be endow'd,
    if she be mated with an equal husband?

Old Athenian

    Three talents on the present; in future, all.

TIMON

    This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
    To build his fortune I will strain a little,
    For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
    What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
    And make him weigh with her.

Old Athenian

    Most noble lord,
    Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.

TIMON

    My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.

LUCILIUS

    Humbly I thank your lordship: never may
    The state or fortune fall into my keeping,
    Which is not owed to you!

    Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian

Poet

    Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!

TIMON

    I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
    Go not away. What have you there, my friend?

Painter

    A piece of painting, which I do beseech
    Your lordship to accept.

TIMON

    Painting is welcome.
    The painting is almost the natural man;
    or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
    He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
    Even such as they give out. I like your work;
    And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
    Till you hear further from me.

Painter

    The gods preserve ye!

TIMON

    Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;
    We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
    Hath suffer'd under praise.

Jeweller

    What, my lord! dispraise?

TIMON

    A more satiety of commendations.
    If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
    It would unclew me quite.

Jeweller

    My lord, 'tis rated
    As those which sell would give: but you well know,
    Things of like value differing in the owners
    Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,
    You mend the jewel by the wearing it.

TIMON

    Well mock'd.

Merchant

    No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
    Which all men speak with him.

TIMON

    Look, who comes here: will you be chid?

    Enter APEMANTUS
    Jeweller: We'll bear, with your lordship.

Merchant

    He'll spare none.

TIMON

    Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!

APEMANTUS

    Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
    When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.

TIMON

    Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.

APEMANTUS

    Are they not Athenians?

TIMON

    Yes.

APEMANTUS

    Then I repent not.
    Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS

    Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.

TIMON

    Thou art proud, Apemantus.

APEMANTUS

    Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.

TIMON

    Whither art going?

APEMANTUS

    To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.

TIMON

    That's a deed thou'lt die for.

APEMANTUS

    Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.

TIMON

    How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS

    The best, for the innocence.

TIMON

    Wrought he not well that painted it?

APEMANTUS

    He wrought better that made the painter; and yet
    he's but a filthy piece of work.

Painter

    You're a dog.

APEMANTUS

    Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?

TIMON

    Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS

    No; I eat not lords.

TIMON

    An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.

APEMANTUS

    O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.

TIMON

    That's a lascivious apprehension.

APEMANTUS

    So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.

TIMON

    How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS

    Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a
    man a doit.

TIMON

    What dost thou think 'tis worth?

APEMANTUS

    Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!

Poet

    How now, philosopher!

APEMANTUS

    Thou liest.

Poet

    Art not one?

APEMANTUS

    Yes.

Poet

    Then I lie not.

APEMANTUS

    Art not a poet?

Poet

    Yes.

APEMANTUS

    Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou
    hast feigned him a worthy fellow.

Poet

    That's not feigned; he is so.

APEMANTUS

    Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
    labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'
    the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!

TIMON

    What wouldst do then, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS

    E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.

TIMON

    What, thyself?

APEMANTUS

    Ay.

TIMON

    Wherefore?

APEMANTUS

    That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
    Art not thou a merchant?

Merchant

    Ay, Apemantus.

APEMANTUS

    Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!

Merchant

    If traffic do it, the gods do it.

APEMANTUS

    Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!

    Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger

TIMON

    What trumpet's that?

Messenger

    'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
    All of companionship.

TIMON

    Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.

    Exeunt some Attendants
    You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
    Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,
    Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.

    Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest
    Most welcome, sir!

APEMANTUS

    So, so, there!
    Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
    That there should be small love 'mongst these
    sweet knaves,
    And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
    Into baboon and monkey.

ALCIBIADES

    Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed
    Most hungerly on your sight.

TIMON

    Right welcome, sir!
    Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time
    In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.

    Exeunt all except APEMANTUS

    Enter two Lords

First Lord

    What time o' day is't, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS

    Time to be honest.

First Lord

    That time serves still.

APEMANTUS

    The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.

Second Lord

    Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?

APEMANTUS

    Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.

Second Lord

    Fare thee well, fare thee well.

APEMANTUS

    Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.

Second Lord

    Why, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS

    Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to
    give thee none.

First Lord

    Hang thyself!

APEMANTUS

    No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy
    requests to thy friend.

Second Lord

    Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!

APEMANTUS

    I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.

    Exit

First Lord

    He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,
    And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes
    The very heart of kindness.

Second Lord

    He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
    Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays
    Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,
    But breeds the giver a return exceeding
    All use of quittance.

First Lord

    The noblest mind he carries
    That ever govern'd man.

Second Lord

    Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?

First Lord

    I'll keep you company.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.

    Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS. Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS, discontentedly, like himself

VENTIDIUS

    Most honour'd Timon,
    It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,
    And call him to long peace.
    He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
    Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
    To your free heart, I do return those talents,
    Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
    I derived liberty.

TIMON

    O, by no means,
    Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:
    I gave it freely ever; and there's none
    Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
    If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
    To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.

VENTIDIUS

    A noble spirit!

TIMON

    Nay, my lords,

    They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON
    Ceremony was but devised at first
    To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
    Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
    But where there is true friendship, there needs none.
    Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes
    Than my fortunes to me.

    They sit

First Lord

    My lord, we always have confess'd it.

APEMANTUS

    Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?

TIMON

    O, Apemantus, you are welcome.

APEMANTUS

    No;
    You shall not make me welcome:
    I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.

TIMON

    Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there
    Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.
    They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond
    man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by
    himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is
    he fit for't, indeed.

APEMANTUS

    Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to
    observe; I give thee warning on't.

TIMON

    I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,
    therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;
    prithee, let my meat make thee silent.

APEMANTUS

    I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should
    ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of
    men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me
    to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;
    and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.
    I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
    Methinks they should invite them without knives;
    Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
    There's much example for't; the fellow that sits
    next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the
    breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest
    man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a
    huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;
    Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
    Great men should drink with harness on their throats.

TIMON

    My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.

Second Lord

    Let it flow this way, my good lord.

APEMANTUS

    Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides
    well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
    look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to
    be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:
    This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
    Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
    Apemantus' grace.
    Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
    I pray for no man but myself:
    Grant I may never prove so fond,
    To trust man on his oath or bond;
    Or a harlot, for her weeping;
    Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:
    Or a keeper with my freedom;
    Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
    Amen. So fall to't:
    Rich men sin, and I eat root.

    Eats and drinks
    Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!

TIMON

    Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.

ALCIBIADES

    My heart is ever at your service, my lord.

TIMON

    You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
    dinner of friends.

ALCIBIADES

    So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat
    like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.

APEMANTUS

    Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,
    that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!

First Lord

    Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
    would once use our hearts, whereby we might express
    some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves
    for ever perfect.

TIMON

    O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods
    themselves have provided that I shall have much help
    from you: how had you been my friends else? why
    have you that charitable title from thousands, did
    not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
    more of you to myself than you can with modesty
    speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm
    you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any
    friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they
    were the most needless creatures living, should we
    ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble
    sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
    sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished
    myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
    are born to do benefits: and what better or
    properer can we can our own than the riches of our
    friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have
    so many, like brothers, commanding one another's
    fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!
    Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to
    forget their faults, I drink to you.

APEMANTUS

    Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.

Second Lord

    Joy had the like conception in our eyes
    And at that instant like a babe sprung up.

APEMANTUS

    Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.

Third Lord

    I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.

APEMANTUS

    Much!

    Tucket, within

TIMON

    What means that trump?

    Enter a Servant
    How now?

Servant

    Please you, my lord, there are certain
    ladies most desirous of admittance.

TIMON

    Ladies! what are their wills?

Servant

    There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which
    bears that office, to signify their pleasures.

TIMON

    I pray, let them be admitted.

    Enter Cupid

Cupid

    Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all
    That of his bounties taste! The five best senses
    Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely
    To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,
    Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;
    They only now come but to feast thine eyes.

TIMON

    They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:
    Music, make their welcome!

    Exit Cupid

First Lord

    You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.

    Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies as Amazons, with lutes in their hands, dancing and playing

APEMANTUS

    Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!
    They dance! they are mad women.
    Like madness is the glory of this life.
    As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
    We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;
    And spend our flatteries, to drink those men
    Upon whose age we void it up again,
    With poisonous spite and envy.
    Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
    Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves
    Of their friends' gift?
    I should fear those that dance before me now
    Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;
    Men shut their doors against a setting sun.

    The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of TIMON; and to show their loves, each singles out an Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty strain or two to the hautboys, and cease

TIMON

    You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,
    Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,
    Which was not half so beautiful and kind;
    You have added worth unto 't and lustre,
    And entertain'd me with mine own device;
    I am to thank you for 't.

First Lady

    My lord, you take us even at the best.

APEMANTUS

    'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold
    taking, I doubt me.

TIMON

    Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:
    Please you to dispose yourselves.

All Ladies

    Most thankfully, my lord.

    Exeunt Cupid and Ladies

TIMON

    Flavius.

FLAVIUS

    My lord?

TIMON

    The little casket bring me hither.

FLAVIUS

    Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!
    There is no crossing him in 's humour;

    Aside
    Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
    When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could.
    'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
    That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.

    Exit

First Lord

    Where be our men?

Servant

    Here, my lord, in readiness.

Second Lord

    Our horses!

    Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket

TIMON

    O my friends,
    I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,
    I must entreat you, honour me so much
    As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,
    Kind my lord.

First Lord

    I am so far already in your gifts,--

All

    So are we all.

    Enter a Servant

Servant

    My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate
    Newly alighted, and come to visit you.

TIMON

    They are fairly welcome.

FLAVIUS

    I beseech your honour,
    Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.

TIMON

    Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:
    I prithee, let's be provided to show them
    entertainment.

FLAVIUS

    [Aside] I scarce know how.

    Enter a Second Servant

Second Servant

    May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,
    Out of his free love, hath presented to you
    Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.

TIMON

    I shall accept them fairly; let the presents
    Be worthily entertain'd.

    Enter a third Servant
    How now! what news?

Third Servant

    Please you, my lord, that honourable
    gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company
    to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour
    two brace of greyhounds.

TIMON

    I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,
    Not without fair reward.

FLAVIUS

    [Aside] What will this come to?
    He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,
    And all out of an empty coffer:
    Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
    To show him what a beggar his heart is,
    Being of no power to make his wishes good:
    His promises fly so beyond his state
    That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
    For every word: he is so kind that he now
    Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.
    Well, would I were gently put out of office
    Before I were forced out!
    Happier is he that has no friend to feed
    Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
    I bleed inwardly for my lord.

    Exit

TIMON

    You do yourselves
    Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:
    Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.

Second Lord

    With more than common thanks I will receive it.

Third Lord

    O, he's the very soul of bounty!

TIMON

    And now I remember, my lord, you gave
    Good words the other day of a bay courser
    I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.

Second Lord

    O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.

TIMON

    You may take my word, my lord; I know, no man
    Can justly praise but what he does affect:
    I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;
    I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.

All Lords

    O, none so welcome.

TIMON

    I take all and your several visitations
    So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
    Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,
    And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,
    Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;
    It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living
    Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
    Lie in a pitch'd field.

ALCIBIADES

    Ay, defiled land, my lord.

First Lord

    We are so virtuously bound--

TIMON

    And so
    Am I to you.

Second Lord

    So infinitely endear'd--

TIMON

    All to you. Lights, more lights!

First Lord

    The best of happiness,
    Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!

TIMON

    Ready for his friends.

    Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON

APEMANTUS

    What a coil's here!
    Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
    I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
    That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:
    Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,
    Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.

TIMON

    Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be
    good to thee.

APEMANTUS

    No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,
    there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then
    thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,
    Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in
    paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and
    vain-glories?

TIMON

    Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am
    sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come
    with better music.

    Exit

APEMANTUS

    So:
    Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:
    I'll lock thy heaven from thee.
    O, that men's ears should be
    To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!

    Exit

ACT II
SCENE I. A Senator's house.

    Enter Senator, with papers in his hand

Senator

    And late, five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore
    He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,
    Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
    Of raging waste? It cannot hold; it will not.
    If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,
    And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
    If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more
    Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,
    Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,
    And able horses. No porter at his gate,
    But rather one that smiles and still invites
    All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason
    Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!
    Caphis, I say!

    Enter CAPHIS

CAPHIS

    Here, sir; what is your pleasure?

Senator

    Get on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon;
    Importune him for my moneys; be not ceased
    With slight denial, nor then silenced when--
    'Commend me to your master'--and the cap
    Plays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,
    My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn
    Out of mine own; his days and times are past
    And my reliances on his fracted dates
    Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,
    But must not break my back to heal his finger;
    Immediate are my needs, and my relief
    Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,
    But find supply immediate. Get you gone:
    Put on a most importunate aspect,
    A visage of demand; for, I do fear,
    When every feather sticks in his own wing,
    Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
    Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.

CAPHIS

    I go, sir.

Senator

    'I go, sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,
    And have the dates in contempt.

CAPHIS

    I will, sir.

Senator

    Go.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. The same. A hall in Timon's house.

    Enter FLAVIUS, with many bills in his hand

FLAVIUS

    No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
    That he will neither know how to maintain it,
    Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account
    How things go from him, nor resumes no care
    Of what is to continue: never mind
    Was to be so unwise, to be so kind.
    What shall be done? he will not hear, till feel:
    I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.
    Fie, fie, fie, fie!

    Enter CAPHIS, and the Servants of Isidore and Varro

CAPHIS

    Good even, Varro: what,
    You come for money?
    Varro's Servant Is't not your business too?

CAPHIS

    It is: and yours too, Isidore?
    Isidore's Servant It is so.

CAPHIS

    Would we were all discharged!
    Varro's Servant I fear it.

CAPHIS

    Here comes the lord.

    Enter TIMON, ALCIBIADES, and Lords, & c

TIMON

    So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,
    My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?

CAPHIS

    My lord, here is a note of certain dues.

TIMON

    Dues! Whence are you?

CAPHIS

    Of Athens here, my lord.

TIMON

    Go to my steward.

CAPHIS

    Please it your lordship, he hath put me off
    To the succession of new days this month:
    My master is awaked by great occasion
    To call upon his own, and humbly prays you
    That with your other noble parts you'll suit
    In giving him his right.

TIMON

    Mine honest friend,
    I prithee, but repair to me next morning.

CAPHIS

    Nay, good my lord,--

TIMON

    Contain thyself, good friend.
    Varro's Servant One Varro's servant, my good lord,--
    Isidore's Servant From Isidore;
    He humbly prays your speedy payment.

CAPHIS

    If you did know, my lord, my master's wants--
    Varro's Servant 'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks And past.
    Isidore's Servant Your steward puts me off, my lord;
    And I am sent expressly to your lordship.

TIMON

    Give me breath.
    I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;
    I'll wait upon you instantly.

    Exeunt ALCIBIADES and Lords

    To FLAVIUS
    Come hither: pray you,
    How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd
    With clamourous demands of date-broke bonds,
    And the detention of long-since-due debts,
    Against my honour?

FLAVIUS

    Please you, gentlemen,
    The time is unagreeable to this business:
    Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
    That I may make his lordship understand
    Wherefore you are not paid.

TIMON

    Do so, my friends. See them well entertain'd.

    Exit

FLAVIUS

    Pray, draw near.

    Exit

    Enter APEMANTUS and Fool

CAPHIS

    Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus:
    let's ha' some sport with 'em.
    Varro's Servant Hang him, he'll abuse us.
    Isidore's Servant A plague upon him, dog!
    Varro's Servant How dost, fool?

APEMANTUS

    Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
    Varro's Servant I speak not to thee.

APEMANTUS

    No,'tis to thyself.

    To the Fool
    Come away.
    Isidore's Servant There's the fool hangs on your back already.

APEMANTUS

    No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.

CAPHIS

    Where's the fool now?

APEMANTUS

    He last asked the question. Poor rogues, and
    usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!

All Servants

    What are we, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS

    Asses.

All Servants

    Why?

APEMANTUS

    That you ask me what you are, and do not know
    yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.

Fool

    How do you, gentlemen?

All Servants

    Gramercies, good fool: how does your mistress?

Fool

    She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens
    as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!

APEMANTUS

    Good! gramercy.

    Enter Page

Fool

    Look you, here comes my mistress' page.

Page

    [To the Fool] Why, how now, captain! what do you
    in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS

    Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer
    thee profitably.

Page

    Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of
    these letters: I know not which is which.

APEMANTUS

    Canst not read?

Page

    No.

APEMANTUS

    There will little learning die then, that day thou
    art hanged. This is to Lord Timon; this to
    Alcibiades. Go; thou wast born a bastard, and thou't
    die a bawd.

Page

    Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a
    dog's death. Answer not; I am gone.

    Exit

APEMANTUS

    E'en so thou outrunnest grace. Fool, I will go with
    you to Lord Timon's.

Fool

    Will you leave me there?

APEMANTUS

    If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?

All Servants

    Ay; would they served us!

APEMANTUS

    So would I,--as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.

Fool

    Are you three usurers' men?

All Servants

    Ay, fool.

Fool

    I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my
    mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come
    to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and
    go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house
    merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?
    Varro's Servant I could render one.

APEMANTUS

    Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster
    and a knave; which not-withstanding, thou shalt be
    no less esteemed.
    Varro's Servant What is a whoremaster, fool?

Fool

    A fool in good clothes, and something like thee.
    'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord;
    sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher,
    with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is
    very often like a knight; and, generally, in all
    shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore
    to thirteen, this spirit walks in.
    Varro's Servant Thou art not altogether a fool.

Fool

    Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as
    I have, so much wit thou lackest.

APEMANTUS

    That answer might have become Apemantus.

All Servants

    Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.

    Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS

APEMANTUS

    Come with me, fool, come.

Fool

    I do not always follow lover, elder brother and
    woman; sometime the philosopher.

    Exeunt APEMANTUS and Fool

FLAVIUS

    Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.

    Exeunt Servants

TIMON

    You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time
    Had you not fully laid my state before me,
    That I might so have rated my expense,
    As I had leave of means?

FLAVIUS

    You would not hear me,
    At many leisures I proposed.

TIMON

    Go to:
    Perchance some single vantages you took.
    When my indispos ition put you back:
    And that unaptness made your minister,
    Thus to excuse yourself.

FLAVIUS

    O my good lord,
    At many times I brought in my accounts,
    Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
    And say, you found them in mine honesty.
    When, for some trifling present, you have bid me
    Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;
    Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you
    To hold your hand more close: I did endure
    Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have
    Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
    And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,
    Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--
    The greatest of your having lacks a half
    To pay your present debts.

TIMON

    Let all my land be sold.

FLAVIUS

    'Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone;
    And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
    Of present dues: the future comes apace:
    What shall defend the interim? and at length
    How goes our reckoning?

TIMON

    To Lacedaemon did my land extend.

FLAVIUS

    O my good lord, the world is but a word:
    Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
    How quickly were it gone!

TIMON

    You tell me true.

FLAVIUS

    If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
    Call me before the exactest auditors
    And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
    When all our offices have been oppress'd
    With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
    With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
    Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
    I have retired me to a wasteful cock,
    And set mine eyes at flow.

TIMON

    Prithee, no more.

FLAVIUS

    Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!
    How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
    This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?
    What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is
    Lord Timon's?
    Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!
    Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,
    The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:
    Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,
    These flies are couch'd.

TIMON

    Come, sermon me no further:
    No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
    Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
    Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,
    To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
    If I would broach the vessels of my love,
    And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
    Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
    As I can bid thee speak.

FLAVIUS

    Assurance bless your thoughts!

TIMON

    And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,
    That I account them blessings; for by these
    Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you
    Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.
    Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!

    Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and other Servants

Servants

    My lord? my lord?

TIMON

    I will dispatch you severally; you to Lord Lucius;
    to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour
    to-day: you, to Sempronius: commend me to their
    loves, and, I am proud, say, that my occasions have
    found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let
    the request be fifty talents.

FLAMINIUS

    As you have said, my lord.

FLAVIUS

    [Aside] Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!

TIMON

    Go you, sir, to the senators--
    Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have
    Deserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instant
    A thousand talents to me.

FLAVIUS

    I have been bold--
    For that I knew it the most general way--
    To them to use your signet and your name;
    But they do shake their heads, and I am here
    No richer in return.

TIMON

    Is't true? can't be?

FLAVIUS

    They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,
    That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot
    Do what they would; are sorry--you are honourable,--
    But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--
    Something hath been amiss--a noble nature
    May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity;--
    And so, intending other serious matters,
    After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,
    With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
    They froze me into silence.

TIMON

    You gods, reward them!
    Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
    Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:
    Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;
    'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
    And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
    Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.

    To a Servant
    Go to Ventidius.

    To FLAVIUS
    Prithee, be not sad,
    Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak.
    No blame belongs to thee.

    To Servant
    Ventidius lately
    Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd
    Into a great estate: when he was poor,
    Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,
    I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me;
    Bid him suppose some good necessity
    Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd
    With those five talents.

    Exit Servant

    To FLAVIUS
    That had, give't these fellows
    To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,
    That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.

FLAVIUS

    I would I could not think it: that thought is
    bounty's foe;
    Being free itself, it thinks all others so.

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. A room in Lucullus' house.

    FLAMINIUS waiting. Enter a Servant to him

Servant

    I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.

FLAMINIUS

    I thank you, sir.

    Enter LUCULLUS

Servant

    Here's my lord.

LUCULLUS

    [Aside] One of Lord Timon's men? a gift, I
    warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver
    basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest
    Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome, sir.
    Fill me some wine.

    Exit Servants
    And how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted
    gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord
    and master?

FLAMINIUS

    His health is well sir.

LUCULLUS

    I am right glad that his health is well, sir: and
    what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?

FLAMINIUS

    'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir; which, in my
    lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to
    supply; who, having great and instant occasion to
    use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to
    furnish him, nothing doubting your present
    assistance therein.

LUCULLUS

    La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas,
    good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not
    keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'
    dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to
    supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,
    and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning
    by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty
    is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get
    him from't.

    Re-enter Servant, with wine

Servant

    Please your lordship, here is the wine.

LUCULLUS

    Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.

FLAMINIUS

    Your lordship speaks your pleasure.

LUCULLUS

    I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt
    spirit--give thee thy due--and one that knows what
    belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if
    the time use thee well: good parts in thee.

    To Servant
    Get you gone, sirrah.

    Exit Servant
    Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a
    bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou
    knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,
    that this is no time to lend money, especially upon
    bare friendship, without security. Here's three
    solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say
    thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.

FLAMINIUS

    Is't possible the world should so much differ,
    And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,
    To him that worships thee!

    Throwing the money back

LUCULLUS

    Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.

    Exit

FLAMINIUS

    May these add to the number that may scald thee!
    Let moulten coin be thy damnation,
    Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!
    Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,
    It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,
    I feel master's passion! this slave,
    Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him:
    Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,
    When he is turn'd to poison?
    O, may diseases only work upon't!
    And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
    Which my lord paid for, be of any power
    To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!

    Exit

SCENE II. A public place.

    Enter LUCILIUS, with three Strangers

LUCILIUS

    Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and
    an honourable gentleman.

First Stranger

    We know him for no less, though we are but strangers
    to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and
    which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's
    happy hours are done and past, and his estate
    shrinks from him.

LUCILIUS

    Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.

Second Stranger

    But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,
    one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
    so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and
    showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.

LUCILIUS

    How!

Second Stranger

    I tell you, denied, my lord.

LUCILIUS

    What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,
    I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!
    there was very little honour showed in't. For my own
    part, I must needs confess, I have received some
    small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels
    and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;
    yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should
    ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.

    Enter SERVILIUS

SERVILIUS

    See, by good hap, yonder's my lord;
    I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,--

    To LUCIUS

LUCILIUS

    Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:
    commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very
    exquisite friend.

SERVILIUS

    May it please your honour, my lord hath sent--

LUCILIUS

    Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to
    that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank
    him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?

SERVILIUS

    Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;
    requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
    with so many talents.

LUCILIUS

    I know his lordship is but merry with me;
    He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.

SERVILIUS

    But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
    If his occasion were not virtuous,
    I should not urge it half so faithfully.

LUCILIUS

    Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?

SERVILIUS

    Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.

LUCILIUS

    What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself
    against such a good time, when I might ha' shown
    myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I
    should purchase the day before for a little part,
    and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,
    before the gods, I am not able to do,--the more
    beast, I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timon
    myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would
    not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.
    Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I
    hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,
    because I have no power to be kind: and tell him
    this from me, I count it one of my greatest
    afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an
    honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you
    befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?

SERVILIUS

    Yes, sir, I shall.

LUCILIUS

    I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.

    Exit SERVILIUS
    True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;
    And he that's once denied will hardly speed.

    Exit

First Stranger

    Do you observe this, Hostilius?

Second Stranger

    Ay, too well.

First Stranger

    Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the
    same piece
    Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
    His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
    My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,
    And kept his credit with his purse,
    Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money
    Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,
    But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;
    And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man
    When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
    He does deny him, in respect of his,
    What charitable men afford to beggars.

Third Stranger

    Religion groans at it.

First Stranger

    For mine own part,
    I never tasted Timon in my life,
    Nor came any of his bounties over me,
    To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,
    For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue
    And honourable carriage,
    Had his necessity made use of me,
    I would have put my wealth into donation,
    And the best half should have return'd to him,
    So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,
    Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
    For policy sits above conscience.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A room in Sempronius' house.

    Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON's

SEMPRONIUS

    Must he needs trouble me in 't,--hum!--'bove
    all others?
    He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;
    And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
    Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these
    Owe their estates unto him.

Servant

    My lord,
    They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
    They have au denied him.

SEMPRONIUS

    How! have they denied him?
    Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
    And does he send to me? Three? hum!
    It shows but little love or judgment in him:
    Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like
    physicians,
    Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?
    Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,
    That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,
    But his occasion might have woo'd me first;
    For, in my conscience, I was the first man
    That e'er received gift from him:
    And does he think so backwardly of me now,
    That I'll requite its last? No:
    So it may prove an argument of laughter
    To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.
    I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,
    Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
    I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
    And with their faint reply this answer join;
    Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.

    Exit

Servant

    Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The
    devil knew not what he did when he made man
    politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot
    think but, in the end, the villainies of man will
    set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
    appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,
    like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
    whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his
    politic love.
    This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,
    Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,
    Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
    Many a bounteous year must be employ'd
    Now to guard sure their master.
    And this is all a liberal course allows;
    Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.

    Exit

SCENE IV. The same. A hall in Timon's house.

    Enter two Servants of Varro, and the Servant of LUCIUS, meeting TITUS, HORTENSIUS, and other Servants of TIMON's creditors, waiting his coming out

    Varro's

First Servant

    Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.

TITUS

    The like to you kind Varro.

HORTENSIUS

    Lucius!
    What, do we meet together?
    Lucilius' Servant Ay, and I think
    One business does command us all; for mine Is money.

TITUS

    So is theirs and ours.

    Enter PHILOTUS
    Lucilius' Servant And Sir Philotus too!

PHILOTUS

    Good day at once.
    Lucilius' Servant Welcome, good brother.
    What do you think the hour?

PHILOTUS

    Labouring for nine.
    Lucilius' Servant So much?

PHILOTUS

    Is not my lord seen yet?
    Lucilius' Servant Not yet.

PHILOTUS

    I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.
    Lucilius' Servant Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:
    You must consider that a prodigal course
    Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.
    I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
    That is one may reach deep enough, and yet
    Find little.

PHILOTUS

    I am of your fear for that.

TITUS

    I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
    Your lord sends now for money.

HORTENSIUS

    Most true, he does.

TITUS

    And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,
    For which I wait for money.

HORTENSIUS

    It is against my heart.
    Lucilius' Servant Mark, how strange it shows,
    Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
    And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,
    And send for money for 'em.

HORTENSIUS

    I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:
    I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,
    And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
    Varro's

First Servant

    Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?
    Lucilius' Servant Five thousand mine.
    Varro's

First Servant

    'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,
    Your master's confidence was above mine;
    Else, surely, his had equall'd.
    Enter FLAMINIUS.

TITUS

    One of Lord Timon's men.
    Lucilius' Servant Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready to
    come forth?

FLAMINIUS

    No, indeed, he is not.

TITUS

    We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.

FLAMINIUS

    I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.

    Exit

    Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak, muffled
    Lucilius' Servant Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?
    He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.

TITUS

    Do you hear, sir?
    Varro's

Second Servant

    By your leave, sir,--

FLAVIUS

    What do ye ask of me, my friend?

TITUS

    We wait for certain money here, sir.

FLAVIUS

    Ay,
    If money were as certain as your waiting,
    'Twere sure enough.
    Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,
    When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
    Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
    And take down the interest into their
    gluttonous maws.
    You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;
    Let me pass quietly:
    Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;
    I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
    Lucilius' Servant Ay, but this answer will not serve.

FLAVIUS

    If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;
    For you serve knaves.

    Exit
    Varro's

First Servant

    How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?
    Varro's

Second Servant

    No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge
    enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no
    house to put his head in? such may rail against
    great buildings.

    Enter SERVILIUS

TITUS

    O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.

SERVILIUS

    If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some
    other hour, I should derive much from't; for,
    take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to
    discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;
    he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.
    Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:
    And, if it be so far beyond his health,
    Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,
    And make a clear way to the gods.

SERVILIUS

    Good gods!

TITUS

    We cannot take this for answer, sir.

FLAMINIUS

    [Within] Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!

    Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following

TIMON

    What, are my doors opposed against my passage?
    Have I been ever free, and must my house
    Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?
    The place which I have feasted, does it now,
    Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
    Lucilius' Servant Put in now, Titus.

TITUS

    My lord, here is my bill.
    Lucilius' Servant Here's mine.

HORTENSIUS

    And mine, my lord.
    Both
    Varro's Servants And ours, my lord.

PHILOTUS

    All our bills.

TIMON

    Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
    Lucilius' Servant Alas, my lord,-

TIMON

    Cut my heart in sums.

TITUS

    Mine, fifty talents.

TIMON

    Tell out my blood.
    Lucilius' Servant Five thousand crowns, my lord.

TIMON

    Five thousand drops pays that.
    What yours?--and yours?
    Varro's

First Servant

    My lord,--
    Varro's

Second Servant

    My lord,--

TIMON

    Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!

    Exit

HORTENSIUS

    'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps
    at their money: these debts may well be called
    desperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.

    Exeunt

    Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS

TIMON

    They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
    Creditors? devils!

FLAVIUS

    My dear lord,--

TIMON

    What if it should be so?

FLAVIUS

    My lord,--

TIMON

    I'll have it so. My steward!

FLAVIUS

    Here, my lord.

TIMON

    So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,
    Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:
    All, sirrah, all:
    I'll once more feast the rascals.

FLAVIUS

    O my lord,
    You only speak from your distracted soul;
    There is not so much left, to furnish out
    A moderate table.

TIMON

    Be't not in thy care; go,
    I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide
    Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.

    Exeunt

SCENE V. The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.
First Senator

    My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's
    Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:
    Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.

Second Senator

    Most true; the law shall bruise him.

    Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants

ALCIBIADES

    Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!

First Senator

    Now, captain?

ALCIBIADES

    I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
    For pity is the virtue of the law,
    And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
    It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
    Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,
    Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
    To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.
    He is a man, setting his fate aside,
    Of comely virtues:
    Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
    An honour in him which buys out his fault--
    But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
    Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
    He did oppose his foe:
    And with such sober and unnoted passion
    He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
    As if he had but proved an argument.

First Senator

    You undergo too strict a paradox,
    Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:
    Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
    To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
    Upon the head of valour; which indeed
    Is valour misbegot and came into the world
    When sects and factions were newly born:
    He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
    The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
    His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,
    carelessly,
    And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
    To bring it into danger.
    If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
    What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!

ALCIBIADES

    My lord,--

First Senator

    You cannot make gross sins look clear:
    To revenge is no valour, but to bear.

ALCIBIADES

    My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,
    If I speak like a captain.
    Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
    And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,
    And let the foes quietly cut their throats,
    Without repugnancy? If there be
    Such valour in the bearing, what make we
    Abroad? why then, women are more valiant
    That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
    And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
    Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
    If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,
    As you are great, be pitifully good:
    Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
    To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;
    But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.
    To be in anger is impiety;
    But who is man that is not angry?
    Weigh but the crime with this.

Second Senator

    You breathe in vain.

ALCIBIADES

    In vain! his service done
    At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
    Were a sufficient briber for his life.

First Senator

    What's that?

ALCIBIADES

    I say, my lords, he has done fair service,
    And slain in fight many of your enemies:
    How full of valour did he bear himself
    In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!

Second Senator

    He has made too much plenty with 'em;
    He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
    Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:
    If there were no foes, that were enough
    To overcome him: in that beastly fury
    He has been known to commit outrages,
    And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,
    His days are foul and his drink dangerous.

First Senator

    He dies.

ALCIBIADES

    Hard fate! he might have died in war.
    My lords, if not for any parts in him--
    Though his right arm might purchase his own time
    And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,
    Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:
    And, for I know your reverend ages love
    Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
    My honours to you, upon his good returns.
    If by this crime he owes the law his life,
    Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore
    For law is strict, and war is nothing more.

First Senator

    We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,
    On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,
    He forfeits his own blood that spills another.

ALCIBIADES

    Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,
    I do beseech you, know me.

Second Senator

    How!

ALCIBIADES

    Call me to your remembrances.

Third Senator

    What!

ALCIBIADES

    I cannot think but your age has forgot me;
    It could not else be, I should prove so base,
    To sue, and be denied such common grace:
    My wounds ache at you.

First Senator

    Do you dare our anger?
    'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;
    We banish thee for ever.

ALCIBIADES

    Banish me!
    Banish your dotage; banish usury,
    That makes the senate ugly.

First Senator

    If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,
    Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell
    our spirit,
    He shall be executed presently.

    Exeunt Senators

ALCIBIADES

    Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live
    Only in bone, that none may look on you!
    I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,
    While they have told their money and let out
    Their coin upon large interest, I myself
    Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
    Is this the balsam that the usuring senate
    Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!
    It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;
    It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,
    That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up
    My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.
    'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
    Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.

    Exit

SCENE VI. The same. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.

    Music. Tables set out: Servants attending. Enter divers Lords, Senators and others, at several doors

First Lord

    The good time of day to you, sir.

Second Lord

    I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord
    did but try us this other day.

First Lord

    Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we
    encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as
    he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.

Second Lord

    It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.

First Lord

    I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest
    inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me
    to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and
    I must needs appear.

Second Lord

    In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
    business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am
    sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my
    provision was out.

First Lord

    I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all
    things go.

Second Lord

    Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of
    you?

First Lord

    A thousand pieces.

Second Lord

    A thousand pieces!

First Lord

    What of you?

Second Lord

    He sent to me, sir,--Here he comes.

    Enter TIMON and Attendants

TIMON

    With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?

First Lord

    Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.

Second Lord

    The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
    your lordship.

TIMON

    [Aside] Nor more willingly leaves winter; such
    summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not
    recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the
    music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the
    trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.

First Lord

    I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
    that I returned you an empty messenger.

TIMON

    O, sir, let it not trouble you.

Second Lord

    My noble lord,--

TIMON

    Ah, my good friend, what cheer?

Second Lord

    My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,
    that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,
    I was so unfortunate a beggar.

TIMON

    Think not on 't, sir.

Second Lord

    If you had sent but two hours before,--

TIMON

    Let it not cumber your better remembrance.

    The banquet brought in
    Come, bring in all together.

Second Lord

    All covered dishes!

First Lord

    Royal cheer, I warrant you.

Third Lord

    Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield
    it.

First Lord

    How do you? What's the news?

Third Lord

    Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?

First Lord Second Lord

    Alcibiades banished!

Third Lord

    'Tis so, be sure of it.

First Lord

    How! how!

Second Lord

    I pray you, upon what?

TIMON

    My worthy friends, will you draw near?

Third Lord

    I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.

Second Lord

    This is the old man still.

Third Lord

    Will 't hold? will 't hold?

Second Lord

    It does: but time will--and so--

Third Lord

    I do conceive.

TIMON

    Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to
    the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all
    places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let
    the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:
    sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
    You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with
    thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves
    praised: but reserve still to give, lest your
    deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that
    one need not lend to another; for, were your
    godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the
    gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man
    that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without
    a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at
    the table, let a dozen of them be--as they are. The
    rest of your fees, O gods--the senators of Athens,
    together with the common lag of people--what is
    amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for
    destruction. For these my present friends, as they
    are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to
    nothing are they welcome.
    Uncover, dogs, and lap.

    The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of warm water

Some Speak

    What does his lordship mean?

Some Others

    I know not.

TIMON

    May you a better feast never behold,
    You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water
    Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;
    Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,
    Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces
    Your reeking villany.

    Throwing the water in their faces
    Live loathed and long,
    Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,
    Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,
    You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,
    Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!
    Of man and beast the infinite malady
    Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?
    Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--
    Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.

    Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out
    What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,
    Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.
    Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be
    Of Timon man and all humanity!

    Exit

    Re-enter the Lords, Senators, & c

First Lord

    How now, my lords!

Second Lord

    Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?

Third Lord

    Push! did you see my cap?

Fourth Lord

    I have lost my gown.

First Lord

    He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.
    He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has
    beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?

Third Lord

    Did you see my cap?

Second Lord

    Here 'tis.

Fourth Lord

    Here lies my gown.

First Lord

    Let's make no stay.

Second Lord

    Lord Timon's mad.

Third Lord

    I feel 't upon my bones.

Fourth Lord

    One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Without the walls of Athens.

    Enter TIMON

TIMON

    Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,
    That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,
    And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!
    Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,
    Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,
    And minister in their steads! to general filths
    Convert o' the instant, green virginity,
    Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;
    Rather than render back, out with your knives,
    And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!
    Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,
    And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
    Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,
    pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,
    With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,
    Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
    Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,
    Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
    Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,
    Decline to your confounding contraries,
    And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,
    Your potent and infectious fevers heap
    On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,
    Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
    As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty
    Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
    That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
    And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,
    Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop
    Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,
    at their society, as their friendship, may
    merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,
    But nakedness, thou detestable town!
    Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
    Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
    The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
    The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--
    The Athenians both within and out that wall!
    And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
    To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.

    Exit

SCENE II. Athens. A room in Timon's house.

    Enter FLAVIUS, with two or three Servants

First Servant

    Hear you, master steward, where's our master?
    Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?

FLAVIUS

    Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
    Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,
    I am as poor as you.

First Servant

    Such a house broke!
    So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not
    One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
    And go along with him!

Second Servant

    As we do turn our backs
    From our companion thrown into his grave,
    So his familiars to his buried fortunes
    Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,
    Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,
    A dedicated beggar to the air,
    With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,
    Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.

    Enter other Servants

FLAVIUS

    All broken implements of a ruin'd house.

Third Servant

    Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;
    That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,
    Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,
    And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
    Hearing the surges threat: we must all part
    Into this sea of air.

FLAVIUS

    Good fellows all,
    The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
    Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,
    Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,
    As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,
    'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;
    Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:
    Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.

    Servants embrace, and part several ways
    O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
    Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
    Since riches point to misery and contempt?
    Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live
    But in a dream of friendship?
    To have his pomp and all what state compounds
    But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
    Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
    Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,
    When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!
    Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?
    For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.
    My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
    Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
    Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!
    He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
    Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to
    Supply his life, or that which can command it.
    I'll follow and inquire him out:
    I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;
    Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.

    Exit

SCENE III. Woods and cave, near the seashore.

    Enter TIMON, from the cave

    O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
    Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb
    Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,
    Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
    Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;
    The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,
    To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,
    But by contempt of nature.
    Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;
    The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
    The beggar native honour.
    It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
    The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
    In purity of manhood stand upright,
    And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,
    So are they all; for every grise of fortune
    Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
    Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
    There's nothing level in our cursed natures,
    But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd
    All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
    His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:
    Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!

    Digging
    Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
    With thy most operant poison! What is here?
    Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,
    I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!
    Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
    Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
    Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this
    Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
    Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:
    This yellow slave
    Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,
    Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
    And give them title, knee and approbation
    With senators on the bench: this is it
    That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
    She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
    Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
    To the April day again. Come, damned earth,
    Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds
    Among the route of nations, I will make thee
    Do thy right nature.

    March afar off
    Ha! a drum ? Thou'rt quick,
    But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,
    When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
    Nay, stay thou out for earnest.

    Keeping some gold

    Enter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA

ALCIBIADES

    What art thou there? speak.

TIMON

    A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,
    For showing me again the eyes of man!

ALCIBIADES

    What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,
    That art thyself a man?

TIMON

    I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
    For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
    That I might love thee something.

ALCIBIADES

    I know thee well;
    But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.

TIMON

    I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,
    I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;
    With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:
    Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;
    Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
    Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
    For all her cherubim look.

PHRYNIA

    Thy lips rot off!

TIMON

    I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
    To thine own lips again.

ALCIBIADES

    How came the noble Timon to this change?

TIMON

    As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
    But then renew I could not, like the moon;
    There were no suns to borrow of.

ALCIBIADES

    Noble Timon,
    What friendship may I do thee?

TIMON

    None, but to
    Maintain my opinion.

ALCIBIADES

    What is it, Timon?

TIMON

    Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou
    wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art
    a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for
    thou art a man!

ALCIBIADES

    I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.

TIMON

    Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.

ALCIBIADES

    I see them now; then was a blessed time.

TIMON

    As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.

TIMANDRA

    Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world
    Voiced so regardfully?

TIMON

    Art thou Timandra?

TIMANDRA

    Yes.

TIMON

    Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;
    Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
    Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves
    For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth
    To the tub-fast and the diet.

TIMANDRA

    Hang thee, monster!

ALCIBIADES

    Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits
    Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.
    I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
    The want whereof doth daily make revolt
    In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,
    How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
    Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,
    But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--

TIMON

    I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.

ALCIBIADES

    I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.

TIMON

    How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
    I had rather be alone.

ALCIBIADES

    Why, fare thee well:
    Here is some gold for thee.

TIMON

    Keep it, I cannot eat it.

ALCIBIADES

    When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,--

TIMON

    Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?

ALCIBIADES

    Ay, Timon, and have cause.

TIMON

    The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
    And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!

ALCIBIADES

    Why me, Timon?

TIMON

    That, by killing of villains,
    Thou wast born to conquer my country.
    Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;
    Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
    Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison
    In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:
    Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;
    He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;
    It is her habit only that is honest,
    Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
    Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,
    That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
    Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
    But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,
    Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
    Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
    Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
    And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;
    Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
    Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
    Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
    Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:
    Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,
    Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.

ALCIBIADES

    Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou
    givest me,
    Not all thy counsel.

TIMON

    Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse
    upon thee!

PHRYNIA TIMANDRA

    Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?

TIMON

    Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
    And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
    Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,
    Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear
    Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
    The immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths,
    I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;
    And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
    Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
    Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
    And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,
    Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs
    With burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd,
    No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still;
    Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,
    A pox of wrinkles!

PHRYNIA TIMANDRA

    Well, more gold: what then?
    Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold.

TIMON

    Consumptions sow
    In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
    And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,
    That he may never more false title plead,
    Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,
    That scolds against the quality of flesh,
    And not believes himself: down with the nose,
    Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away
    Of him that, his particular to foresee,
    Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate
    ruffians bald;
    And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
    Derive some pain from you: plague all;
    That your activity may defeat and quell
    The source of all erection. There's more gold:
    Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
    And ditches grave you all!

PHRYNIA TIMANDRA

    More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.

TIMON

    More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.

ALCIBIADES

    Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:
    If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.

TIMON

    If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.

ALCIBIADES

    I never did thee harm.

TIMON

    Yes, thou spokest well of me.

ALCIBIADES

    Call'st thou that harm?

TIMON

    Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take
    Thy beagles with thee.

ALCIBIADES

    We but offend him. Strike!

    Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES, PHRYNIA, and TIMANDRA

TIMON

    That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,
    Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,

    Digging
    Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,
    Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,
    Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,
    Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
    The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
    With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
    Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;
    Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,
    From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!
    Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,
    Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!
    Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
    Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face
    Hath to the marbled mansion all above
    Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--
    Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
    Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts
    And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,
    That from it all consideration slips!

    Enter APEMANTUS
    More man? plague, plague!

APEMANTUS

    I was directed hither: men report
    Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.

TIMON

    'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
    Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!

APEMANTUS

    This is in thee a nature but infected;
    A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
    From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
    This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
    Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;
    Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot
    That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
    By putting on the cunning of a carper.
    Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive
    By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
    And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
    Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
    And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;
    Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
    To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
    That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,
    Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.

TIMON

    Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.

APEMANTUS

    Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;
    A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
    That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,
    Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,
    That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,
    And skip where thou point'st out? will the
    cold brook,
    Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
    To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures
    Whose naked natures live in an the spite
    Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,
    To the conflicting elements exposed,
    Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;
    O, thou shalt find--

TIMON

    A fool of thee: depart.

APEMANTUS

    I love thee better now than e'er I did.

TIMON

    I hate thee worse.

APEMANTUS

    Why?

TIMON

    Thou flatter'st misery.

APEMANTUS

    I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.

TIMON

    Why dost thou seek me out?

APEMANTUS

    To vex thee.

TIMON

    Always a villain's office or a fool's.
    Dost please thyself in't?

APEMANTUS

    Ay.

TIMON

    What! a knave too?

APEMANTUS

    If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
    To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou
    Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,
    Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
    Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:
    The one is filling still, never complete;
    The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,
    Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
    Worse than the worst, content.
    Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.

TIMON

    Not by his breath that is more miserable.
    Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm
    With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.
    Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded
    The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
    To such as may the passive drugs of it
    Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself
    In general riot; melted down thy youth
    In different beds of lust; and never learn'd
    The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd
    The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,
    Who had the world as my confectionary,
    The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men
    At duty, more than I could frame employment,
    That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
    Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush
    Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare
    For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,
    That never knew but better, is some burden:
    Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
    Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
    They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?
    If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
    Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
    To some she beggar and compounded thee
    Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
    If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
    Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.

APEMANTUS

    Art thou proud yet?

TIMON

    Ay, that I am not thee.

APEMANTUS

    I, that I was
    No prodigal.

TIMON

    I, that I am one now:
    Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,
    I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
    That the whole life of Athens were in this!
    Thus would I eat it.

    Eating a root

APEMANTUS

    Here; I will mend thy feast.

    Offering him a root

TIMON

    First mend my company, take away thyself.

APEMANTUS

    So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.

TIMON

    'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;
    if not, I would it were.

APEMANTUS

    What wouldst thou have to Athens?

TIMON

    Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
    Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.

APEMANTUS

    Here is no use for gold.

TIMON

    The best and truest;
    For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.

APEMANTUS

    Where liest o' nights, Timon?

TIMON

    Under that's above me.
    Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?

APEMANTUS

    Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eat
    it.

TIMON

    Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!

APEMANTUS

    Where wouldst thou send it?

TIMON

    To sauce thy dishes.

APEMANTUS

    The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the
    extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt
    and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much
    curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art
    despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for
    thee, eat it.

TIMON

    On what I hate I feed not.

APEMANTUS

    Dost hate a medlar?

TIMON

    Ay, though it look like thee.

APEMANTUS

    An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst
    have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou
    ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?

TIMON

    Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou
    ever know beloved?

APEMANTUS

    Myself.

TIMON

    I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep a
    dog.

APEMANTUS

    What things in the world canst thou nearest compare
    to thy flatterers?

TIMON

    Women nearest; but men, men are the things
    themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,
    Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?

APEMANTUS

    Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.

TIMON

    Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
    men, and remain a beast with the beasts?

APEMANTUS

    Ay, Timon.

TIMON

    A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'
    attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would
    beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would
    eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would
    suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by
    the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would
    torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a
    breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy
    greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst
    hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the
    unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and
    make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert
    thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:
    wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the
    leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to
    the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
    thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy
    defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that
    were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art
    thou already, that seest not thy loss in
    transformation!

APEMANTUS

    If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou
    mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of
    Athens is become a forest of beasts.

TIMON

    How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?

APEMANTUS

    Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of
    company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it
    and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll
    see thee again.

TIMON

    When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be
    welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.

APEMANTUS

    Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.

TIMON

    Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!

APEMANTUS

    A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.

TIMON

    All villains that do stand by thee are pure.

APEMANTUS

    There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.

TIMON

    If I name thee.
    I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.

APEMANTUS

    I would my tongue could rot them off!

TIMON

    Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
    Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
    I swound to see thee.

APEMANTUS

    Would thou wouldst burst!

TIMON

    Away,
    Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose
    A stone by thee.

    Throws a stone at him

APEMANTUS

    Beast!

TIMON

    Slave!

APEMANTUS

    Toad!

TIMON

    Rogue, rogue, rogue!
    I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
    But even the mere necessities upon 't.
    Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
    Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
    Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
    That death in me at others' lives may laugh.

    To the gold
    O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
    'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
    Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
    Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
    Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
    That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
    That solder'st close impossibilities,
    And makest them kiss! that speak'st with
    every tongue,
    To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
    Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
    Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
    May have the world in empire!

APEMANTUS

    Would 'twere so!
    But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:
    Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.

TIMON

    Throng'd to!

APEMANTUS

    Ay.

TIMON

    Thy back, I prithee.

APEMANTUS

    Live, and love thy misery.

TIMON

    Long live so, and so die.

    Exit APEMANTUS
    I am quit.
    Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.

    Enter Banditti

First Bandit

    Where should he have this gold? It is some poor
    fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the
    mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his
    friends, drove him into this melancholy.

Second Bandit

    It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.

Third Bandit

    Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not
    for't, he will supply us easily; if he covetously
    reserve it, how shall's get it?

Second Bandit

    True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.

First Bandit

    Is not this he?

Banditti

    Where?

Second Bandit

    'Tis his description.

Third Bandit

    He; I know him.

Banditti

    Save thee, Timon.

TIMON

    Now, thieves?

Banditti

    Soldiers, not thieves.

TIMON

    Both too; and women's sons.

Banditti

    We are not thieves, but men that much do want.

TIMON

    Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
    Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;
    Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
    The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;
    The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush
    Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?

First Bandit

    We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,
    As beasts and birds and fishes.

TIMON

    Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
    You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
    That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
    In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
    In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
    Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
    Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
    And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;
    His antidotes are poison, and he slays
    Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
    Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,
    Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.
    The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
    Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
    And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
    The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
    The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
    That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
    From general excrement: each thing's a thief:
    The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
    Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,
    Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
    All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,
    Break open shops; nothing can you steal,
    But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
    I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.

Third Bandit

    Has almost charmed me from my profession, by
    persuading me to it.

First Bandit

    'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
    us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.

Second Bandit

    I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.

First Bandit

    Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time
    so miserable but a man may be true.

    Exeunt Banditti

    Enter FLAVIUS

FLAVIUS

    O you gods!
    Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
    Full of decay and failing? O monument
    And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
    What an alteration of honour
    Has desperate want made!
    What viler thing upon the earth than friends
    Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
    How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
    When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
    Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
    Those that would mischief me than those that do!
    Has caught me in his eye: I will present
    My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,
    Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!

TIMON

    Away! what art thou?

FLAVIUS

    Have you forgot me, sir?

TIMON

    Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
    Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.

FLAVIUS

    An honest poor servant of yours.

TIMON

    Then I know thee not:
    I never had honest man about me, I; all
    I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.

FLAVIUS

    The gods are witness,
    Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
    For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.

TIMON

    What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I
    love thee,
    Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
    Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give
    But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
    Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!

FLAVIUS

    I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
    To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
    To entertain me as your steward still.

TIMON

    Had I a steward
    So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
    It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
    Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
    Was born of woman.
    Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
    You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
    One honest man--mistake me not--but one;
    No more, I pray,--and he's a steward.
    How fain would I have hated all mankind!
    And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
    I fell with curses.
    Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
    For, by oppressing and betraying me,
    Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
    For many so arrive at second masters,
    Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
    For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--
    Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
    If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,
    Expecting in return twenty for one?

FLAVIUS

    No, my most worthy master; in whose breast
    Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:
    You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:
    Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
    That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
    Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,
    Care of your food and living; and, believe it,
    My most honour'd lord,
    For any benefit that points to me,
    Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
    For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
    To requite me, by making rich yourself.

TIMON

    Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,
    Here, take: the gods out of my misery
    Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;
    But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
    Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
    But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,
    Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs
    What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
    Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
    blasted woods,
    And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
    And so farewell and thrive.

FLAVIUS

    O, let me stay,
    And comfort you, my master.

TIMON

    If thou hatest curses,
    Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:
    Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.

    Exit FLAVIUS. TIMON retires to his cave

ACT V
SCENE I. The woods. Before Timon's cave.

    Enter Poet and Painter; TIMON watching them from his cave

Painter

    As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where
    he abides.

Poet

    What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold
    for true, that he's so full of gold?

Painter

    Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and
    Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor
    straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said
    he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.

Poet

    Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.

Painter

    Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens
    again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore
    'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this
    supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
    us; and is very likely to load our purposes with
    what they travail for, if it be a just true report
    that goes of his having.

Poet

    What have you now to present unto him?

Painter

    Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will
    promise him an excellent piece.

Poet

    I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent
    that's coming toward him.

Painter

    Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the
    time: it opens the eyes of expectation:
    performance is ever the duller for his act; and,
    but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the
    deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is
    most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind
    of will or testament which argues a great sickness
    in his judgment that makes it.

    TIMON comes from his cave, behind

TIMON

    [Aside] Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a
    man so bad as is thyself.

Poet

    I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for
    him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire
    against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery
    of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.

TIMON

    [Aside] Must thou needs stand for a villain in
    thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in
    other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.

Poet

    Nay, let's seek him:
    Then do we sin against our own estate,
    When we may profit meet, and come too late.

Painter

    True;
    When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,
    Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.

TIMON

    [Aside] I'll meet you at the turn. What a
    god's gold,
    That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
    Than where swine feed!
    'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
    Settlest admired reverence in a slave:
    To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye
    Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!
    Fit I meet them.

    Coming forward

Poet

    Hail, worthy Timon!

Painter

    Our late noble master!

TIMON

    Have I once lived to see two honest men?

Poet

    Sir,
    Having often of your open bounty tasted,
    Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,
    Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits!--
    Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:
    What! to you,
    Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
    To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover
    The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
    With any size of words.

TIMON

    Let it go naked, men may see't the better:
    You that are honest, by being what you are,
    Make them best seen and known.

Painter

    He and myself
    Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,
    And sweetly felt it.

TIMON

    Ay, you are honest men.

Painter

    We are hither come to offer you our service.

TIMON

    Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
    Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.

Both

    What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.

TIMON

    Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;
    I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.

Painter

    So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore
    Came not my friend nor I.

TIMON

    Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
    Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;
    Thou counterfeit'st most lively.

Painter

    So, so, my lord.

TIMON

    E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,
    Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
    That thou art even natural in thine art.
    But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,
    I must needs say you have a little fault:
    Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I
    You take much pains to mend.

Both

    Beseech your honour
    To make it known to us.

TIMON

    You'll take it ill.

Both

    Most thankfully, my lord.

TIMON

    Will you, indeed?

Both

    Doubt it not, worthy lord.

TIMON

    There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,
    That mightily deceives you.

Both

    Do we, my lord?

TIMON

    Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,
    Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
    Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured
    That he's a made-up villain.

Painter

    I know none such, my lord.

Poet

    Nor I.

TIMON

    Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
    Rid me these villains from your companies:
    Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
    Confound them by some course, and come to me,
    I'll give you gold enough.

Both

    Name them, my lord, let's know them.

TIMON

    You that way and you this, but two in company;
    Each man apart, all single and alone,
    Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
    If where thou art two villains shall not be,
    Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside
    But where one villain is, then him abandon.
    Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:

    To Painter
    You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!

    To Poet
    You are an alchemist; make gold of that.
    Out, rascal dogs!

    Beats them out, and then retires to his cave

    Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators

FLAVIUS

    It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;
    For he is set so only to himself
    That nothing but himself which looks like man
    Is friendly with him.

First Senator

    Bring us to his cave:
    It is our part and promise to the Athenians
    To speak with Timon.

Second Senator

    At all times alike
    Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs
    That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,
    Offering the fortunes of his former days,
    The former man may make him. Bring us to him,
    And chance it as it may.

FLAVIUS

    Here is his cave.
    Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!
    Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,
    By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:
    Speak to them, noble Timon.

    TIMON comes from his cave

TIMON

    Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and
    be hang'd:
    For each true word, a blister! and each false
    Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,
    Consuming it with speaking!

First Senator

    Worthy Timon,--

TIMON

    Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.

First Senator

    The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.

TIMON

    I thank them; and would send them back the plague,
    Could I but catch it for them.

First Senator

    O, forget
    What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
    The senators with one consent of love
    Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
    On special dignities, which vacant lie
    For thy best use and wearing.

Second Senator

    They confess
    Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:
    Which now the public body, which doth seldom
    Play the recanter, feeling in itself
    A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
    Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;
    And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,
    Together with a recompense more fruitful
    Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
    Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
    As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
    And write in thee the figures of their love,
    Ever to read them thine.

TIMON

    You witch me in it;
    Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
    Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
    And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.

First Senator

    Therefore, so please thee to return with us
    And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take
    The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
    Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
    Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back
    Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
    Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up
    His country's peace.

Second Senator

    And shakes his threatening sword
    Against the walls of Athens.

First Senator

    Therefore, Timon,--

TIMON

    Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:
    If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
    Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
    That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,
    And take our goodly aged men by the beards,
    Giving our holy virgins to the stain
    Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,
    Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,
    In pity of our aged and our youth,
    I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,
    And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,
    While you have throats to answer: for myself,
    There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
    But I do prize it at my love before
    The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
    To the protection of the prosperous gods,
    As thieves to keepers.

FLAVIUS

    Stay not, all's in vain.

TIMON

    Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
    it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness
    Of health and living now begins to mend,
    And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;
    Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
    And last so long enough!

First Senator

    We speak in vain.

TIMON

    But yet I love my country, and am not
    One that rejoices in the common wreck,
    As common bruit doth put it.

First Senator

    That's well spoke.

TIMON

    Commend me to my loving countrymen,--

First Senator

    These words become your lips as they pass
    thorough them.

Second Senator

    And enter in our ears like great triumphers
    In their applauding gates.

TIMON

    Commend me to them,
    And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
    Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
    Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
    That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
    In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:
    I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.

First Senator

    I like this well; he will return again.

TIMON

    I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
    That mine own use invites me to cut down,
    And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,
    Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree
    From high to low throughout, that whoso please
    To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
    Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
    And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.

FLAVIUS

    Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.

TIMON

    Come not to me again: but say to Athens,
    Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
    Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;
    Who once a day with his embossed froth
    The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,
    And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
    Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
    What is amiss plague and infection mend!
    Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
    Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.

    Retires to his cave

First Senator

    His discontents are unremoveably
    Coupled to nature.

Second Senator

    Our hope in him is dead: let us return,
    And strain what other means is left unto us
    In our dear peril.

First Senator

    It requires swift foot.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Before the walls of Athens.

    Enter two Senators and a Messenger

First Senator

    Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
    As full as thy report?

Messenger

    have spoke the least:
    Besides, his expedition promises
    Present approach.

Second Senator

    We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.

Messenger

    I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;
    Whom, though in general part we were opposed,
    Yet our old love made a particular force,
    And made us speak like friends: this man was riding
    From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,
    With letters of entreaty, which imported
    His fellowship i' the cause against your city,
    In part for his sake moved.

First Senator

    Here come our brothers.

    Enter the Senators from TIMON

Third Senator

    No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
    The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring
    Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:
    Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. The woods. Timon's cave, and a rude tomb seen.

    Enter a Soldier, seeking TIMON

Soldier

    By all description this should be the place.
    Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?
    Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:
    Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.
    Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
    I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:
    Our captain hath in every figure skill,
    An aged interpreter, though young in days:
    Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
    Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.

    Exit

SCENE IV. Before the walls of Athens.

    Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers

ALCIBIADES

    Sound to this coward and lascivious town
    Our terrible approach.

    A parley sounded

    Enter Senators on the walls
    Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
    With all licentious measure, making your wills
    The scope of justice; till now myself and such
    As slept within the shadow of your power
    Hav e wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
    Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,
    When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
    Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong
    Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
    And pursy insolence shall break his wind
    With fear and horrid flight.

First Senator

    Noble and young,
    When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
    Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
    We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,
    To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
    Above their quantity.

Second Senator

    So did we woo
    Transformed Timon to our city's love
    By humble message and by promised means:
    We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
    The common stroke of war.

First Senator

    These walls of ours
    Were not erected by their hands from whom
    You have received your griefs; nor are they such
    That these great towers, trophies and schools
    should fall
    For private faults in them.

Second Senator

    Nor are they living
    Who were the motives that you first went out;
    Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess
    Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
    Into our city with thy banners spread:
    By decimation, and a tithed death--
    If thy revenges hunger for that food
    Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,
    And by the hazard of the spotted die
    Let die the spotted.

First Senator

    All have not offended;
    For those that were, it is not square to take
    On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
    Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
    Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:
    Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
    Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
    With those that have offended: like a shepherd,
    Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,
    But kill not all together.

Second Senator

    What thou wilt,
    Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
    Than hew to't with thy sword.

First Senator

    Set but thy foot
    Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;
    So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
    To say thou'lt enter friendly.

Second Senator

    Throw thy glove,
    Or any token of thine honour else,
    That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
    And not as our confusion, all thy powers
    Shall make their harbour in our town, till we
    Have seal'd thy full desire.

ALCIBIADES

    Then there's my glove;
    Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
    Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
    Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
    Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears
    With my more noble meaning, not a man
    Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
    Of regular justice in your city's bounds,
    But shall be render'd to your public laws
    At heaviest answer.

Both

    'Tis most nobly spoken.

ALCIBIADES

    Descend, and keep your words.

    The Senators descend, and open the gates

    Enter Soldier

Soldier

    My noble general, Timon is dead;
    Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;
    And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
    With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
    Interprets for my poor ignorance.

ALCIBIADES

    [Reads the epitaph] 'Here lies a
    wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:
    Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
    caitiffs left!
    Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:
    Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay
    not here thy gait.'
    These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
    Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,
    Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our
    droplets which
    From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
    Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
    On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
    Is noble Timon: of whose memory
    Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,
    And I will use the olive with my sword,
    Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
    Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
    Let our drums strike.

    Exeunt


Titus Andronicus

ACT I
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Capitol.

    The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing; the Tribunes and Senators aloft. Enter, below, from one side, SATURNINUS and his Followers; and, from the other side, BASSIANUS and his Followers; with drum and colours

SATURNINUS

    Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
    Defend the justice of my cause with arms,
    And, countrymen, my loving followers,
    Plead my successive title with your swords:
    I am his first-born son, that was the last
    That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
    Then let my father's honours live in me,
    Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.

BASSIANUS

    Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,
    If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,
    Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
    Keep then this passage to the Capitol
    And suffer not dishonour to approach
    The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
    To justice, continence and nobility;
    But let desert in pure election shine,
    And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.

    Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS, aloft, with the crown

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
    Ambitiously for rule and empery,
    Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
    A special party, have, by common voice,
    In election for the Roman empery,
    Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius
    For many good and great deserts to Rome:
    A nobler man, a braver warrior,
    Lives not this day within the city walls:
    He by the senate is accit'd home
    From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;
    That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,
    Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.
    Ten years are spent since first he undertook
    This cause of Rome and chastised with arms
    Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd
    Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
    In coffins from the field;
    And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,
    Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
    Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
    Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
    Whom worthily you would have now succeed.
    And in the Capitol and senate's right,
    Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
    That you withdraw you and abate your strength;
    Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,
    Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.

SATURNINUS

    How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!

BASSIANUS

    Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally
    In thy uprightness and integrity,
    And so I love and honour thee and thine,
    Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
    And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
    Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
    That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
    And to my fortunes and the people's favor
    Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.

    Exeunt the followers of BASSIANUS

SATURNINUS

    Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
    I thank you all and here dismiss you all,
    And to the love and favor of my country
    Commit myself, my person and the cause.

    Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS
    Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
    As I am confident and kind to thee.
    Open the gates, and let me in.

BASSIANUS

    Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.

    Flourish. SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS go up into the Capitol

    Enter a Captain

Captain

    Romans, make way: the good Andronicus.
    Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
    Successful in the battles that he fights,
    With honour and with fortune is return'd
    From where he circumscribed with his sword,
    And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.

    Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and MUTIUS; After them, two Men bearing a coffin covered with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After them, TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA, with ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths, prisoners; Soldiers and people following. The Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
    Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
    Returns with precious jading to the bay
    From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
    Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
    To re-salute his country with his tears,
    Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
    Thou great defender of this Capitol,
    Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
    Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
    Half of the number that King Priam had,
    Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
    These that survive let Rome reward with love;
    These that I bring unto their latest home,
    With burial amongst their ancestors:
    Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
    Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,
    Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,
    To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
    Make way to lay them by their brethren.

    The tomb is opened
    There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
    And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!
    O sacred receptacle of my joys,
    Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
    How many sons of mine hast thou in store,
    That thou wilt never render to me more!

LUCIUS

    Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
    That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
    Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,
    Before this earthy prison of their bones;
    That so the shadows be not unappeased,
    Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    I give him you, the noblest that survives,
    The eldest son of this distressed queen.

TAMORA

    Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,
    Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
    A mother's tears in passion for her son:
    And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
    O, think my son to be as dear to me!
    Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
    To beautify thy triumphs and return,
    Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,
    But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,
    For valiant doings in their country's cause?
    O, if to fight for king and commonweal
    Were piety in thine, it is in these.
    Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:
    Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
    Draw near them then in being merciful:
    Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
    Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
    These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld
    Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain
    Religiously they ask a sacrifice:
    To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,
    To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.

LUCIUS

    Away with him! and make a fire straight;
    And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
    Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.

    Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and MUTIUS, with ALARBUS

TAMORA

    O cruel, irreligious piety!

CHIRON

    Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?

DEMETRIUS

    Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
    Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive
    To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.
    Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal
    The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
    With opportunity of sharp revenge
    Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,
    May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths--
    When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--
    To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.

    Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with their swords bloody

LUCIUS

    See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
    Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
    And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
    Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.
    Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,
    And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Let it be so; and let Andronicus
    Make this his latest farewell to their souls.

    Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb
    In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
    Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
    Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
    Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
    Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,
    No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
    In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!

    Enter LAVINIA

LAVINIA

    In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
    My noble lord and father, live in fame!
    Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
    I render, for my brethren's obsequies;
    And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,
    Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:
    O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,
    Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved
    The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
    Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
    And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!

    Enter, below, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes; re-enter SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS, attended

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
    Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
    You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!
    Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,
    That in your country's service drew your swords:
    But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,
    That hath aspired to Solon's happiness
    And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
    Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
    Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
    Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,
    This palliament of white and spotless hue;
    And name thee in election for the empire,
    With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:
    Be candidatus then, and put it on,
    And help to set a head on headless Rome.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    A better head her glorious body fits
    Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:
    What should I don this robe, and trouble you?
    Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
    To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
    And set abroad new business for you all?
    Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
    And led my country's strength successfully,
    And buried one and twenty valiant sons,
    Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
    In right and service of their noble country
    Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
    But not a sceptre to control the world:
    Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.

SATURNINUS

    Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Patience, Prince Saturninus.

SATURNINUS

    Romans, do me right:
    Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not
    Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.
    Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,
    Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!

LUCIUS

    Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
    That noble-minded Titus means to thee!

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee
    The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.

BASSIANUS

    Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
    But honour thee, and will do till I die:
    My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
    I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
    Of noble minds is honourable meed.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,
    I ask your voices and your suffrages:
    Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?

Tribunes

    To gratify the good Andronicus,
    And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
    The people will accept whom he admits.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,
    That you create your emperor's eldest son,
    Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
    Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
    And ripen justice in this commonweal:
    Then, if you will elect by my advice,
    Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!'

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    With voices and applause of every sort,
    Patricians and plebeians, we create
    Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,
    And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'

    A long flourish till they come down

SATURNINUS

    Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done
    To us in our election this day,
    I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
    And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:
    And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
    Thy name and honourable family,
    Lavinia will I make my empress,
    Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
    And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:
    Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match
    I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:
    And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,
    King and commander of our commonweal,
    The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate
    My sword, my chariot and my prisoners;
    Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:
    Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
    Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.

SATURNINUS

    Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
    How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
    Rome shall record, and when I do forget
    The least of these unspeakable deserts,
    Romans, forget your fealty to me.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    [To TAMORA] Now, madam, are you prisoner to
    an emperor;
    To him that, for your honour and your state,
    Will use you nobly and your followers.

SATURNINUS

    A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue
    That I would choose, were I to choose anew.
    Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:
    Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
    Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:
    Princely shall be thy usage every way.
    Rest on my word, and let not discontent
    Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you
    Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
    Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?

LAVINIA

    Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
    Warrants these words in princely courtesy.

SATURNINUS

    Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;
    Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:
    Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.

    Flourish. SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show

BASSIANUS

    Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.

    Seizing LAVINIA

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?

BASSIANUS

    Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal
    To do myself this reason and this right.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:
    This prince in justice seizeth but his own.

LUCIUS

    And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?
    Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!

SATURNINUS

    Surprised! by whom?

BASSIANUS

    By him that justly may
    Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.

    Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA

MUTIUS

    Brothers, help to convey her hence away,
    And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.

    Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.

MUTIUS

    My lord, you pass not here.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    What, villain boy!
    Barr'st me my way in Rome?

    Stabbing MUTIUS

MUTIUS

    Help, Lucius, help!

    Dies

    During the fray, SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON go out and re-enter, above

    Re-enter LUCIUS

LUCIUS

    My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so,
    In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;
    My sons would never so dishonour me:
    Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.

LUCIUS

    Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,
    That is another's lawful promised love.

    Exit

SATURNINUS

    No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,
    Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
    I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once;
    Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
    Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
    Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,
    But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
    Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,
    That said'st I begg'd the empire at thy hands.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?

SATURNINUS

    But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
    To him that flourish'd for her with his sword
    A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
    One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
    To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    These words are razors to my wounded heart.

SATURNINUS

    And therefore, lovely Tamora, queen of Goths,
    That like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs
    Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
    If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,
    Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,
    And will create thee empress of Rome,
    Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
    And here I swear by all the Roman gods,
    Sith priest and holy water are so near
    And tapers burn so bright and every thing
    In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,
    I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
    Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
    I lead espoused my bride along with me.

TAMORA

    And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,
    If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,
    She will a handmaid be to his desires,
    A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.

SATURNINUS

    Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany
    Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,
    Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,
    Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:
    There shall we consummate our spousal rites.

    Exeunt all but TITUS

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
    Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
    Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?

    Re-enter MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
    In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,
    Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed
    That hath dishonour'd all our family;
    Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!

LUCIUS

    But let us give him burial, as becomes;
    Give Mutius burial with our brethren.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:
    This monument five hundred years hath stood,
    Which I have sumptuously re-edified:
    Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
    Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
    Bury him where you can; he comes not here.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    My lord, this is impiety in you:
    My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him
    He must be buried with his brethren.

QUINTUS MARTIUS

    And shall, or him we will accompany.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    'And shall!' what villain was it that spake
    that word?

QUINTUS

    He that would vouch it in any place but here.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    What, would you bury him in my despite?

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee
    To pardon Mutius and to bury him.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,
    And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded:
    My foes I do repute you every one;
    So, trouble me no more, but get you gone.

MARTIUS

    He is not with himself; let us withdraw.

QUINTUS

    Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.

    MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,--

QUINTUS

    Father, and in that name doth nature speak,--

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,--

LUCIUS

    Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
    His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
    That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.
    Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:
    The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax
    That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son
    Did graciously plead for his funerals:
    Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy
    Be barr'd his entrance here.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Rise, Marcus, rise.
    The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,
    To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!
    Well, bury him, and bury me the next.

    MUTIUS is put into the tomb

LUCIUS

    There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,
    Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.

All

    [Kneeling] No man shed tears for noble Mutius;
    He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,
    How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
    Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    I know not, Marcus; but I know it is,
    Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell:
    Is she not then beholding to the man
    That brought her for this high good turn so far?
    Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.

    Flourish. Re-enter, from one side, SATURNINUS attended, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON; from the other, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, and others

SATURNINUS

    So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
    God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!

BASSIANUS

    And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,
    Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.

SATURNINUS

    Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,
    Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.

BASSIANUS

    Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
    My truth-betrothed love and now my wife?
    But let the laws of Rome determine all;
    Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.

SATURNINUS

    'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;
    But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.

BASSIANUS

    My lord, what I have done, as best I may,
    Answer I must and shall do with my life.
    Only thus much I give your grace to know:
    By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
    This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,
    Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;
    That in the rescue of Lavinia
    With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
    In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
    To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:
    Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine,
    That hath express'd himself in all his deeds
    A father and a friend to thee and Rome.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
    'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.
    Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
    How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine!

TAMORA

    My worthy lord, if ever Tamora
    Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
    Then hear me speak in indifferently for all;
    And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.

SATURNINUS

    What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,
    And basely put it up without revenge?

TAMORA

    Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend
    I should be author to dishonour you!
    But on mine honour dare I undertake
    For good Lord Titus' innocence in all;
    Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:
    Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;
    Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,
    Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.

    Aside to SATURNINUS
    be won at last;
    Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
    You are but newly planted in your throne;
    Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,
    Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,
    And so supplant you for ingratitude,
    Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,
    Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:
    I'll find a day to massacre them all
    And raze their faction and their family,
    The cruel father and his traitorous sons,
    To whom I sued for my dear son's life,
    And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
    Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.

    Aloud
    Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;
    Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart
    That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.

SATURNINUS

    Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    I thank your majesty, and her, my lord:
    These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.

TAMORA

    Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,
    A Roman now adopted happily,
    And must advise the emperor for his good.
    This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;
    And let it be mine honour, good my lord,
    That I have reconciled your friends and you.
    For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd
    My word and promise to the emperor,
    That you will be more mild and tractable.
    And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia;
    By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
    You shall ask pardon of his majesty.

LUCIUS

    We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness,
    That what we did was mildly as we might,
    Tendering our sister's honour and our own.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    That, on mine honour, here I do protest.

SATURNINUS

    Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.

TAMORA

    Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:
    The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;
    I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.

SATURNINUS

    Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,
    And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
    I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up.
    Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
    I found a friend, and sure as death I swore
    I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
    Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides,
    You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
    This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    To-morrow, an it please your majesty
    To hunt the panther and the hart with me,
    With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.

SATURNINUS

    Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.

    Flourish. Exeunt

ACT II
SCENE I. Rome. Before the Palace.

    Enter AARON

AARON

    Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
    Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,
    Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;
    Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.
    As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
    And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
    Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,
    And overlooks the highest-peering hills;
    So Tamora:
    Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
    And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
    Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,
    To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
    And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long
    Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains
    And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
    Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
    Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
    I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,
    To wait upon this new-made empress.
    To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,
    This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
    This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
    And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
    Holloa! what storm is this?

    Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, braving

DEMETRIUS

    Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,
    And manners, to intrude where I am graced;
    And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.

CHIRON

    Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;
    And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
    'Tis not the difference of a year or two
    Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
    I am as able and as fit as thou
    To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;
    And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
    And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.

AARON

    [Aside] Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep
    the peace.

DEMETRIUS

    Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,
    Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
    Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?
    Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath
    Till you know better how to handle it.

CHIRON

    Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,
    Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.

DEMETRIUS

    Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?

    They draw

AARON

    [Coming forward] Why, how now, lords!
    So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,
    And maintain such a quarrel openly?
    Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
    I would not for a million of gold
    The cause were known to them it most concerns;
    Nor would your noble mother for much more
    Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.
    For shame, put up.

DEMETRIUS

    Not I, till I have sheathed
    My rapier in his bosom and withal
    Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat
    That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.

CHIRON

    For that I am prepared and full resolved.
    Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,
    And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!

AARON

    Away, I say!
    Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
    This petty brabble will undo us all.
    Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous
    It is to jet upon a prince's right?
    What, is Lavinia then become so loose,
    Or Bassianus so degenerate,
    That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
    Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
    Young lords, beware! and should the empress know
    This discord's ground, the music would not please.

CHIRON

    I care not, I, knew she and all the world:
    I love Lavinia more than all the world.

DEMETRIUS

    Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
    Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.

AARON

    Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome
    How furious and impatient they be,
    And cannot brook competitors in love?
    I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
    By this device.

CHIRON

    Aaron, a thousand deaths
    Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.

AARON

    To achieve her! how?

DEMETRIUS

    Why makest thou it so strange?
    She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
    She is a woman, therefore may be won;
    She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
    What, man! more water glideth by the mill
    Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
    Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:
    Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.
    Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.

AARON

    [Aside] Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.

DEMETRIUS

    Then why should he despair that knows to court it
    With words, fair looks and liberality?
    What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,
    And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?

AARON

    Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so
    Would serve your turns.

CHIRON

    Ay, so the turn were served.

DEMETRIUS

    Aaron, thou hast hit it.

AARON

    Would you had hit it too!
    Then should not we be tired with this ado.
    Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools
    To square for this? would it offend you, then
    That both should speed?

CHIRON

    Faith, not me.

DEMETRIUS

    Nor me, so I were one.

AARON

    For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:
    'Tis policy and stratagem must do
    That you affect; and so must you resolve,
    That what you cannot as you would achieve,
    You must perforce accomplish as you may.
    Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
    Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
    A speedier course than lingering languishment
    Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
    My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
    There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
    The forest walks are wide and spacious;
    And many unfrequented plots there are
    Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
    Single you thither then this dainty doe,
    And strike her home by force, if not by words:
    This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
    Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit
    To villany and vengeance consecrate,
    Will we acquaint with all that we intend;
    And she shall file our engines with advice,
    That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
    But to your wishes' height advance you both.
    The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,
    The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:
    The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;
    There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take
    your turns;
    There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,
    And revel in Lavinia's treasury.

CHIRON

    Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,

DEMETRIUS

    Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
    To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.
    Per Styga, per manes vehor.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. A forest near Rome. Horns and cry of hounds heard.

    Enter TITUS ANDRONICUS, with Hunters, & c., MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,
    The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:
    Uncouple here and let us make a bay
    And wake the emperor and his lovely bride
    And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,
    That all the court may echo with the noise.
    Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
    To attend the emperor's person carefully:
    I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
    But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.

    A cry of hounds and horns, winded in a peal. Enter SATURNINUS, TAMORA, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, and Attendants
    Many good morrows to your majesty;
    Madam, to you as many and as good:
    I promised your grace a hunter's peal.

SATURNINUS

    And you have rung it lustily, my lord;
    Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.

BASSIANUS

    Lavinia, how say you?

LAVINIA

    I say, no;
    I have been broad awake two hours and more.

SATURNINUS

    Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have,
    And to our sport.

    To TAMORA
    Madam, now shall ye see
    Our Roman hunting.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    I have dogs, my lord,
    Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,
    And climb the highest promontory top.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    And I have horse will follow where the game
    Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.

DEMETRIUS

    Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
    But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.

    Exeunt

SCENE III. A lonely part of the forest.

    Enter AARON, with a bag of gold

AARON

    He that had wit would think that I had none,
    To bury so much gold under a tree,
    And never after to inherit it.
    Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
    Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,
    Which, cunningly effected, will beget
    A very excellent piece of villany:
    And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest

    Hides the gold
    That have their alms out of the empress' chest.

    Enter TAMORA

TAMORA

    My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,
    When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?
    The birds chant melody on every bush,
    The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,
    The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
    And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:
    Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
    And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
    Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,
    As if a double hunt were heard at once,
    Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
    And, after conflict such as was supposed
    The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,
    When with a happy storm they were surprised
    And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,
    We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,
    Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;
    Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
    Be unto us as is a nurse's song
    Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.

AARON

    Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
    Saturn is dominator over mine:
    What signifies my deadly-standing eye,
    My silence and my cloudy melancholy,
    My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
    Even as an adder when she doth unroll
    To do some fatal execution?
    No, madam, these are no venereal signs:
    Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
    Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
    Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,
    Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,
    This is the day of doom for Bassianus:
    His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
    Thy sons make pillage of her chastity
    And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
    Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,
    And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.
    Now question me no more; we are espied;
    Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
    Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.

TAMORA

    Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!

AARON

    No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:
    Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons
    To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.

    Exit

    Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA

BASSIANUS

    Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,
    Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
    Or is it Dian, habited like her,
    Who hath abandoned her holy groves
    To see the general hunting in this forest?

TAMORA

    Saucy controller of our private steps!
    Had I the power that some say Dian had,
    Thy temples should be planted presently
    With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds
    Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
    Unmannerly intruder as thou art!

LAVINIA

    Under your patience, gentle empress,
    'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;
    And to be doubted that your Moor and you
    Are singled forth to try experiments:
    Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
    'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.

BASSIANUS

    Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian
    Doth make your honour of his body's hue,
    Spotted, detested, and abominable.
    Why are you sequester'd from all your train,
    Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
    And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,
    Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,
    If foul desire had not conducted you?

LAVINIA

    And, being intercepted in your sport,
    Great reason that my noble lord be rated
    For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,
    And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;
    This valley fits the purpose passing well.

BASSIANUS

    The king my brother shall have note of this.

LAVINIA

    Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:
    Good king, to be so mightily abused!

TAMORA

    Why have I patience to endure all this?

    Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON

DEMETRIUS

    How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
    Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?

TAMORA

    Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
    These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:
    A barren detested vale, you see it is;
    The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
    O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:
    Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
    Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:
    And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,
    They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
    A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
    Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
    Would make such fearful and confused cries
    As any mortal body hearing it
    Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.
    No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
    But straight they told me they would bind me here
    Unto the body of a dismal yew,
    And leave me to this miserable death:
    And then they call'd me foul adulteress,
    Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
    That ever ear did hear to such effect:
    And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,
    This vengeance on me had they executed.
    Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
    Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.

DEMETRIUS

    This is a witness that I am thy son.

    Stabs BASSIANUS

CHIRON

    And this for me, struck home to show my strength.

    Also stabs BASSIANUS, who dies

LAVINIA

    Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,
    For no name fits thy nature but thy own!

TAMORA

    Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys
    Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.

DEMETRIUS

    Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;
    First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:
    This minion stood upon her chastity,
    Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
    And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:
    And shall she carry this unto her grave?

CHIRON

    An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
    Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
    And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.

TAMORA

    But when ye have the honey ye desire,
    Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.

CHIRON

    I warrant you, madam, we wil l make that sure.
    Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
    That nice-preserved honesty of yours.

LAVINIA

    O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--

TAMORA

    I will not hear her speak; away with her!

LAVINIA

    Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.

DEMETRIUS

    Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
    To see her tears; but be your heart to them
    As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.

LAVINIA

    When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
    O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;
    The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;
    Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
    Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:

    To CHIRON
    Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.

CHIRON

    What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?

LAVINIA

    'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:
    Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
    The lion moved with pity did endure
    To have his princely paws pared all away:
    Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
    The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
    O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
    Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!

TAMORA

    I know not what it means; away with her!

LAVINIA

    O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
    That gave thee life, when well he might have
    slain thee,
    Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.

TAMORA

    Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
    Even for his sake am I pitiless.
    Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
    To save your brother from the sacrifice;
    But fierce Andronicus would not relent;
    Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,
    The worse to her, the better loved of me.

LAVINIA

    O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,
    And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
    For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;
    Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.

TAMORA

    What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go.

LAVINIA

    'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more
    That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
    O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
    And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
    Where never man's eye may behold my body:
    Do this, and be a charitable murderer.

TAMORA

    So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:
    No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.

DEMETRIUS

    Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.

LAVINIA

    No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!
    The blot and enemy to our general name!
    Confusion fall--

CHIRON

    Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:
    This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.

    DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the pit; then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, dragging off LAVINIA

TAMORA

    Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.
    Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,
    Till all the Andronici be made away.
    Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
    And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.

    Exit

    Re-enter AARON, with QUINTUS and MARTIUS

AARON

    Come on, my lords, the better foot before:
    Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
    Where I espied the panther fast asleep.

QUINTUS

    My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.

MARTIUS

    And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame,
    Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.

    Falls into the pit

QUINTUS

    What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,
    Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,
    Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
    As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?
    A very fatal place it seems to me.
    Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?

MARTIUS

    O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt
    That ever eye with sight made heart lament!

AARON

    [Aside] Now will I fetch the king to find them here,
    That he thereby may give a likely guess
    How these were they that made away his brother.

    Exit

MARTIUS

    Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
    From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?

QUINTUS

    I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
    A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:
    My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.

MARTIUS

    To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,
    Aaron and thou look down into this den,
    And see a fearful sight of blood and death.

QUINTUS

    Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart
    Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
    The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;
    O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till now
    Was I a child to fear I know not what.

MARTIUS

    Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,
    All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,
    In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.

QUINTUS

    If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?

MARTIUS

    Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
    A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,
    Which, like a taper in some monument,
    Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
    And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:
    So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
    When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.
    O brother, help me with thy fainting hand--
    If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--
    Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
    As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.

QUINTUS

    Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
    Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
    I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
    Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
    I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.

MARTIUS

    Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.

QUINTUS

    Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
    Till thou art here aloft, or I below:
    Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.

    Falls in

    Enter SATURNINUS with AARON

SATURNINUS

    Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,
    And what he is that now is leap'd into it.
    Say who art thou that lately didst descend
    Into this gaping hollow of the earth?

MARTIUS

    The unhappy son of old Andronicus:
    Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
    To find thy brother Bassianus dead.

SATURNINUS

    My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
    He and his lady both are at the lodge
    Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
    'Tis not an hour since I left him there.

MARTIUS

    We know not where you left him all alive;
    But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.

    Re-enter TAMORA, with Attendants; TITUS ANDRONICUS, and Lucius

TAMORA

    Where is my lord the king?

SATURNINUS

    Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.

TAMORA

    Where is thy brother Bassianus?

SATURNINUS

    Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
    Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.

TAMORA

    Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
    The complot of this timeless tragedy;
    And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
    In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.

    She giveth SATURNINUS a letter

SATURNINUS

    [Reads] 'An if we miss to meet him handsomely--
    Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--
    Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:
    Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward
    Among the nettles at the elder-tree
    Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
    Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.
    Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
    O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
    This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.
    Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
    That should have murdered Bassianus here.

AARON

    My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.

SATURNINUS

    [To TITUS] Two of thy whelps, fell curs of
    bloody kind,
    Have here bereft my brother of his life.
    Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:
    There let them bide until we have devised
    Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.

TAMORA

    What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
    How easily murder is discovered!

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    High emperor, upon my feeble knee
    I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
    That this fell fault of my accursed sons,
    Accursed if the fault be proved in them,--

SATURNINUS

    If it be proved! you see it is apparent.
    Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?

TAMORA

    Andronicus himself did take it up.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;
    For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow
    They shall be ready at your highness' will
    To answer their suspicion with their lives.

SATURNINUS

    Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.
    Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:
    Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;
    For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
    That end upon them should be executed.

TAMORA

    Andronicus, I will entreat the king;
    Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. Another part of the forest.

    Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON with LAVINIA, ravished; her hands cut off, and her tongue cut out

DEMETRIUS

    So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,
    Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee.

CHIRON

    Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,
    An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.

DEMETRIUS

    See, how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.

CHIRON

    Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.

DEMETRIUS

    She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;
    And so let's leave her to her silent walks.

CHIRON

    An 'twere my case, I should go hang myself.

DEMETRIUS

    If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.

    Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON

    Enter MARCUS

MARCUS

    Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast!
    Cousin, a word; where is your husband?
    If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
    If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
    That I may slumber in eternal sleep!
    Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
    Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
    Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,
    Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
    And might not gain so great a happiness
    As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
    Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
    Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
    Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
    Coming and going with thy honey breath.
    But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
    And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
    Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
    And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,
    As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,
    Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
    Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.
    Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?
    O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
    That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!
    Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
    Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
    Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,
    And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:
    But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;
    A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
    And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,
    That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
    O, had the monster seen those lily hands
    Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,
    And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
    He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
    Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony
    Which that sweet tongue hath made,
    He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep
    As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
    Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;
    For such a sight will blind a father's eye:
    One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
    What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
    Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee
    O, could our mourning ease thy misery!

    Exeunt

ACT III
SCENE I. Rome. A street.

    Enter Judges, Senators and Tribunes, with MARTIUS and QUINTUS, bound, passing on to the place of execution; TITUS going before, pleading

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!
    For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
    In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;
    For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;
    For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;
    And for these bitter tears, which now you see
    Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;
    Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
    Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
    For two and twenty sons I never wept,
    Because they died in honour's lofty bed.

    Lieth down; the Judges, & c., pass by him, and Exeunt
    For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write
    My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:
    Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
    My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
    O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,
    That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
    Than youthful April shall with all his showers:
    In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
    In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
    And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
    So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.

    Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn
    O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!
    Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;
    And let me say, that never wept before,
    My tears are now prevailing orators.

LUCIUS

    O noble father, you lament in vain:
    The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;
    And you recount your sorrows to a stone.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.
    Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,--

LUCIUS

    My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,
    They would not mark me, or if they did mark,
    They would not pity me, yet plead I must;
    Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;
    Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
    Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,
    For that they will not intercept my tale:
    When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
    Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;
    And, were they but attired in grave weeds,
    Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
    A stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones;
    A stone is silent, and offendeth not,
    And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.

    Rises
    But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?

LUCIUS

    To rescue my two brothers from their death:
    For which attempt the judges have pronounced
    My everlasting doom of banishment.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    O happy man! they have befriended thee.
    Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
    That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
    Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
    But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,
    From these devourers to be banished!
    But who comes with our brother Marcus here?

    Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;
    Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:
    I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Will it consume me? let me see it, then.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    This was thy daughter.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Why, Marcus, so she is.

LUCIUS

    Ay me, this object kills me!

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
    Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
    Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
    What fool hath added water to the sea,
    Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
    My grief was at the height before thou camest,
    And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.
    Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;
    For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
    And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;
    In bootless prayer have they been held up,
    And they have served me to effectless use:
    Now all the service I require of them
    Is that the one will help to cut the other.
    'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
    For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.

LUCIUS

    Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
    That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,
    Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,
    Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung
    Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!

LUCIUS

    O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    O, thus I found her, straying in the park,
    Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer
    That hath received some unrecuring wound.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    It was my deer; and he that wounded her
    Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:
    For now I stand as one upon a rock
    Environed with a wilderness of sea,
    Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
    Expecting ever when some envious surge
    Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
    This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
    Here stands my other son, a banished man,
    And here my brother, weeping at my woes.
    But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,
    Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
    Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
    It would have madded me: what shall I do
    Now I behold thy lively body so?
    Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:
    Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:
    Thy husband he is dead: and for his death
    Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.
    Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!
    When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
    Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew
    Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
    Perchance because she knows them innocent.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful
    Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
    No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
    Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
    Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
    Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:
    Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,
    And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,
    Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
    How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,
    With miry slime left on them by a flood?
    And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
    Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
    And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
    Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?
    Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
    Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
    What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,
    Plot some deuce of further misery,
    To make us wonder'd at in time to come.

LUCIUS

    Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,
    See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot
    Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,
    For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.

LUCIUS

    Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:
    Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
    That to her brother which I said to thee:
    His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
    Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
    O, what a sympathy of woe is this,
    As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!

    Enter AARON

AARON

    Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor
    Sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,
    Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
    Or any one of you, chop off your hand,
    And send it to the king: he for the same
    Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;
    And that shall be the ransom for their fault.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
    Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
    That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
    With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:
    Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?

LUCIUS

    Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
    That hath thrown down so many enemies,
    Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:
    My youth can better spare my blood than you;
    And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,
    And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,
    Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
    O, none of both but are of high desert:
    My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
    To ransom my two nephews from their death;
    Then have I kept it to a worthy end.

AARON

    Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
    For fear they die before their pardon come.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    My hand shall go.

LUCIUS

    By heaven, it shall not go!

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these
    Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.

LUCIUS

    Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
    Let me redeem my brothers both from death.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    And, for our father's sake and mother's care,
    Now let me show a brother's love to thee.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Agree between you; I will spare my hand.

LUCIUS

    Then I'll go fetch an axe.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    But I will use the axe.

    Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:
    Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.

AARON

    [Aside] If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
    And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:
    But I'll deceive you in another sort,
    And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass.

    Cuts off TITUS's hand

    Re-enter LUCIUS and MARCUS

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd.
    Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:
    Tell him it was a hand that warded him
    From thousand dangers; bid him bury it
    More hath it merited; that let it have.
    As for my sons, say I account of them
    As jewels purchased at an easy price;
    And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.

AARON

    I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand
    Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.

    Aside
    Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany
    Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
    Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.
    Aaron will have his soul black like his face.

    Exit

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
    And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:
    If any power pities wretched tears,
    To that I call!

    To LAVINIA
    What, wilt thou kneel with me?
    Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers;
    Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim,
    And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
    When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    O brother, speak with possibilities,
    And do not break into these deep extremes.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
    Then be my passions bottomless with them.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    But yet let reason govern thy lament.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    If there were reason for these miseries,
    Then into limits could I bind my woes:
    When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
    If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
    Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?
    And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
    I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!
    She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:
    Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
    Then must my earth with her continual tears
    Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
    For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
    But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
    Then give me leave, for losers will have leave
    To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.

    Enter a Messenger, with two heads and a hand

Messenger

    Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
    For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.
    Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
    And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back;
    Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock'd;
    That woe is me to think upon thy woes
    More than remembrance of my father's death.

    Exit

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily,
    And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
    These miseries are more than may be borne.
    To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;
    But sorrow flouted at is double death.

LUCIUS

    Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
    And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
    That ever death should let life bear his name,
    Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!

    LAVINIA kisses TITUS

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
    As frozen water to a starved snake.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    When will this fearful slumber have an end?

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus;
    Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons' heads,
    Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here:
    Thy other banish'd son, with this dear sight
    Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,
    Even like a stony image, cold and numb.
    Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:
    Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand
    Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight
    The closing up of our most wretched eyes;
    Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Ha, ha, ha!

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Why, I have not another tear to shed:
    Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
    And would usurp upon my watery eyes
    And make them blind with tributary tears:
    Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
    For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
    And threat me I shall never come to bliss
    Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
    Even in their throats that have committed them.
    Come, let me see what task I have to do.
    You heavy people, circle me about,
    That I may turn me to each one of you,
    And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
    The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;
    And in this hand the other I will bear.
    Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!
    Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
    As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;
    Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:
    Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:
    And, if you love me, as I think you do,
    Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.

    Exeunt TITUS, MARCUS, and LAVINIA

LUCIUS

    Farewell Andronicus, my noble father,
    The wofull'st man that ever lived in Rome:
    Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
    He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:
    Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;
    O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
    But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
    But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
    If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;
    And make proud Saturnine and his empress
    Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen.
    Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power,
    To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.

    Exit

SCENE II. A room in Titus's house. A banquet set out.

    Enter TITUS, MARCUS, LAVINIA and Young LUCIUS, a boy

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more
    Than will preserve just so much strength in us
    As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
    Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:
    Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,
    And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
    With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
    Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;
    Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,
    Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
    Then thus I thump it down.

    To LAVINIA
    Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!
    When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,
    Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.
    Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;
    Or get some little knife between thy teeth,
    And just against thy heart make thou a hole;
    That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
    May run into that sink, and soaking in
    Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay
    Such violent hands upon her tender life.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?
    Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
    What violent hands can she lay on her life?
    Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;
    To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er,
    How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
    O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
    Lest we remember still that we have none.
    Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
    As if we should forget we had no hands,
    If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
    Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
    Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
    I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
    She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
    Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:
    Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
    In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
    As begging hermits in their holy prayers:
    Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
    Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
    But I of these will wrest an alphabet
    And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.

Young LUCIUS

    Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:
    Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
    Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
    And tears will quickly melt thy life away.

    MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife
    What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    At that that I have kill'd, my lord; a fly.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart;
    Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:
    A deed of death done on the innocent
    Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:
    I see thou art not for my company.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    But how, if that fly had a father and mother?
    How would he hang his slender gilded wings,
    And buzz lamenting doings in the air!
    Poor harmless fly,
    That, with his pretty buzzing melody,
    Came here to make us merry! and thou hast
    kill'd him.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favor'd fly,
    Like to the empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    O, O, O,
    Then pardon me for reprehending thee,
    For thou hast done a charitable deed.
    Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;
    Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor
    Come hither purposely to poison me.--
    There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.
    Ah, sirrah!
    Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,
    But that between us we can kill a fly
    That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
    He takes false shadows for true substances.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:
    I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee
    Sad stories chanced in the times of old.
    Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
    And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.

    Exeunt

ACT IV
SCENE I. Rome. Titus's garden.

    Enter young LUCIUS, and LAVINIA running after him, and the boy flies from her, with books under his arm. Then enter TITUS and MARCUS

Young LUCIUS

    Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
    Follows me every where, I know not why:
    Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
    Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.

Young LUCIUS

    Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:
    See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:
    Somewhither would she have thee go with her.
    Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care
    Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
    Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?

Young LUCIUS

    My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
    Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:
    For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,
    Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
    And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
    Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
    Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
    Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,
    And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:
    Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--
    Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:
    And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
    I will most willingly attend your ladyship.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Lucius, I will.

    LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which LUCIUS has let fall

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
    Some book there is that she desires to see.
    Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.
    But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd
    Come, and take choice of all my library,
    And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
    Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
    Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    I think she means that there was more than one
    Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was;
    Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?

Young LUCIUS

    Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
    My mother gave it me.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    For love of her that's gone,
    Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!

    Helping her
    What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?
    This is the tragic tale of Philomel,
    And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:
    And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
    Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
    Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!
    Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--
    O, had we never, never hunted there!--
    Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,
    By nature made for murders and for rapes.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    O, why should nature build so foul a den,
    Unless the gods delight in tragedies?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none
    but friends,
    What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:
    Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
    That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.
    Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,
    Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
    My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:
    This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst
    This after me, when I have writ my name
    Without the help of any hand at all.

    He writes his name with his staff, and guides it with feet and mouth
    Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
    Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,
    What God will have discover'd for revenge;
    Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,
    That we may know the traitors and the truth!

    She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it with her stumps, and writes

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?
    'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora
    Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Magni Dominator poli,
    Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know
    There is enough written upon this earth
    To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
    And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
    My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;
    And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;
    And swear with me, as, with the woful fere
    And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,
    Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,
    That we will prosecute by good advice
    Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,
    And see their blood, or die with this reproach.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.
    But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:
    The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,
    She's with the lion deeply still in league,
    And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,
    And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
    You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;
    And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
    And with a gad of steel will write these words,
    And lay it by: the angry northern wind
    Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,
    And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?

Young LUCIUS

    I say, my lord, that if I were a man,
    Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe
    For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oft
    For his ungrateful country done the like.

Young LUCIUS

    And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Come, go with me into mine armoury;
    Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
    Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons
    Presents that I intend to send them both:
    Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?

Young LUCIUS

    Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
    Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:
    Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:
    Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.

    Exeunt TITUS, LAVINIA, and Young LUCIUS

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,
    And not relent, or not compassion him?
    Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,
    That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
    Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;
    But yet so just that he will not revenge.
    Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!

    Exit

SCENE II. The same. A room in the palace.

    Enter, from one side, AARON, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON; from the other side, Young LUCIUS, and an Attendant, with a bundle of weapons, and verses writ upon them

CHIRON

    Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
    He hath some message to deliver us.

AARON

    Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.

Young LUCIUS

    My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
    I greet your honours from Andronicus.

    Aside
    And pray the Roman gods confound you both!

DEMETRIUS

    Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?

Young LUCIUS

    [Aside] That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
    For villains mark'd with rape.--May it please you,
    My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me
    The goodliest weapons of his armoury
    To gratify your honourable youth,
    The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say;
    And so I do, and with his gifts present
    Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,
    You may be armed and appointed well:
    And so I leave you both:

    Aside
    like bloody villains.

    Exeunt Young LUCIUS, and Attendant

DEMETRIUS

    What's here? A scroll; and written round about?
    Let's see;

    Reads
    'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,
    Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'

CHIRON

    O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:
    I read it in the grammar long ago.

AARON

    Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.

    Aside
    Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
    Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;
    And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,
    That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
    But were our witty empress well afoot,
    She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:
    But let her rest in her unrest awhile.
    And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
    Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
    Captives, to be advanced to this height?
    It did me good, before the palace gate
    To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.

DEMETRIUS

    But me more good, to see so great a lord
    Basely insinuate and send us gifts.

AARON

    Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
    Did you not use his daughter very friendly?

DEMETRIUS

    I would we had a thousand Roman dames
    At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.

CHIRON

    A charitable wish and full of love.

AARON

    Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.

CHIRON

    And that would she for twenty thousand more.

DEMETRIUS

    Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods
    For our beloved mother in her pains.

AARON

    [Aside] Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.

    Trumpets sound within

DEMETRIUS

    Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?

CHIRON

    Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.

DEMETRIUS

    Soft! who comes here?

    Enter a Nurse, with a blackamoor Child in her arms

Nurse

    Good morr ow, lords:
    O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?

AARON

    Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
    Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?

Nurse

    O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
    Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!

AARON

    Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
    What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?

Nurse

    O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,
    Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!
    She is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd.

AARON

    To whom?

Nurse

    I mean, she is brought a-bed.

AARON

    Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?

Nurse

    A devil.

AARON

    Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.

Nurse

    A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue:
    Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
    Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:
    The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
    And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.

AARON

    'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?
    Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.

DEMETRIUS

    Villain, what hast thou done?

AARON

    That which thou canst not undo.

CHIRON

    Thou hast undone our mother.

AARON

    Villain, I have done thy mother.

DEMETRIUS

    And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.
    Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!
    Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!

CHIRON

    It shall not live.

AARON

    It shall not die.

Nurse

    Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.

AARON

    What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I
    Do execution on my flesh and blood.

DEMETRIUS

    I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:
    Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.

AARON

    Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.

    Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws
    Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?
    Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
    That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
    He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
    That touches this my first-born son and heir!
    I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,
    With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,
    Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,
    Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
    What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
    Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
    Coal-black is better than another hue,
    In that it scorns to bear another hue;
    For all the water in the ocean
    Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,
    Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
    Tell the empress from me, I am of age
    To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.

DEMETRIUS

    Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?

AARON

    My mistress is my mistress; this myself,
    The vigour and the picture of my youth:
    This before all the world do I prefer;
    This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
    Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.

DEMETRIUS

    By this our mother is forever shamed.

CHIRON

    Rome will despise her for this foul escape.

Nurse

    The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death.

CHIRON

    I blush to think upon this ignomy.

AARON

    Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
    Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
    The close enacts and counsels of the heart!
    Here's a young lad framed of another leer:
    Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,
    As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'
    He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
    Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,
    And from that womb where you imprison'd were
    He is enfranchised and come to light:
    Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,
    Although my seal be stamped in his face.

Nurse

    Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?

DEMETRIUS

    Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
    And we will all subscribe to thy advice:
    Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.

AARON

    Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
    My son and I will have the wind of you:
    Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.

    They sit

DEMETRIUS

    How many women saw this child of his?

AARON

    Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,
    I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
    The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
    The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
    But say, again; how many saw the child?

Nurse

    Cornelia the midwife and myself;
    And no one else but the deliver'd empress.

AARON

    The empress, the midwife, and yourself:
    Two may keep counsel when the third's away:
    Go to the empress, tell her this I said.

    He kills the nurse
    Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.

DEMETRIUS

    What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?

AARON

    O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:
    Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,
    A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:
    And now be it known to you my full intent.
    Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;
    His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
    His child is like to her, fair as you are:
    Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
    And tell them both the circumstance of all;
    And how by this their child shall be advanced,
    And be received for the emperor's heir,
    And substituted in the place of mine,
    To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
    And let the emperor dandle him for his own.
    Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,

    Pointing to the nurse
    And you must needs bestow her funeral;
    The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:
    This done, see that you take no longer days,
    But send the midwife presently to me.
    The midwife and the nurse well made away,
    Then let the ladies tattle what they please.

CHIRON

    Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
    With secrets.

DEMETRIUS

    For this care of Tamora,
    Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.

    Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the Nurse's body

AARON

    Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;
    There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
    And secretly to greet the empress' friends.
    Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
    For it is you that puts us to our shifts:
    I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
    And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
    And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
    To be a warrior, and command a camp.

    Exit

SCENE III. The same. A public place.

    Enter TITUS, bearing arrows with letters at the ends of them; with him, MARCUS, Young LUCIUS, PUBLIUS, SEMPRONIUS, CAIUS, and other Gentlemen, with bows

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.
    Sir boy, now let me see your archery;
    Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
    Terras Astraea reliquit:
    Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.
    Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall
    Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;
    Happily you may catch her in the sea;
    Yet there's as little justice as at land:
    No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;
    'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
    And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:
    Then, when you come to Pluto's region,
    I pray you, deliver him this petition;
    Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,
    And that it comes from old Andronicus,
    Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
    Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable
    What time I threw the people's suffrages
    On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.
    Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,
    And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:
    This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;
    And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
    To see thy noble uncle thus distract?

PUBLIUS

    Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns
    By day and night to attend him carefully,
    And feed his humour kindly as we may,
    Till time beget some careful remedy.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
    Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war
    Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,
    And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Publius, how now! how now, my masters!
    What, have you met with her?

PUBLIUS

    No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
    If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:
    Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,
    He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,
    So that perforce you must needs stay a time.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
    I'll dive into the burning lake below,
    And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
    Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we
    No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;
    But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,
    Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:
    And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,
    We will solicit heaven and move the gods
    To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.
    Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;

    He gives them the arrows
    'Ad Jovem,' that's for you: here, 'Ad Apollinem:'
    'Ad Martem,' that's for myself:
    Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury:
    To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine;
    You were as good to shoot against the wind.
    To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid.
    Of my word, I have written to effect;
    There's not a god left unsolicited.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:
    We will afflict the emperor in his pride.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Now, masters, draw.

    They shoot
    O, well said, Lucius!
    Good boy, in Virgo's lap; give it Pallas.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
    Your letter is with Jupiter by this.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Ha, ha!
    Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?
    See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,
    The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock
    That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;
    And who should find them but the empress' villain?
    She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose
    But give them to his master for a present.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!

    Enter a Clown, with a basket, and two pigeons in it
    News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.
    Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?
    Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?

Clown

    O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken
    them down again, for the man must not be hanged till
    the next week.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?

Clown

    Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him
    in all my life.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?

Clown

    Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Why, didst thou not come from heaven?

Clown

    From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there God
    forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my
    young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the
    tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl
    betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for
    your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to
    the emperor from you.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor
    with a grace?

Clown

    Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,
    But give your pigeons to the emperor:
    By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
    Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges.
    Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace
    deliver a supplication?

Clown

    Ay, sir.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Then here is a supplication for you. And when you
    come to him, at the first approach you must kneel,
    then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and
    then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see
    you do it bravely.

Clown

    I warrant you, sir, let me alone.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it.
    Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
    For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.
    And when thou hast given it the emperor,
    Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.

Clown

    God be with you, sir; I will.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.

    Exeunt

SCENE IV. The same. Before the palace.

    Enter SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, Lords, and others; SATURNINUS with the arrows in his hand that TITUS shot

SATURNINUS

    Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen
    An emperor in Rome thus overborne,
    Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent
    Of egal justice, used in such contempt?
    My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
    However these disturbers of our peace
    Buz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd,
    But even with law, against the willful sons
    Of old Andronicus. And what an if
    His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
    Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
    His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
    And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
    See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;
    This to Apollo; this to the god of war;
    Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
    What's this but libelling against the senate,
    And blazoning our injustice every where?
    A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
    As who would say, in Rome no justice were.
    But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
    Shall be no shelter to these outrages:
    But he and his shall know that justice lives
    In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,
    He'll so awake as she in fury shall
    Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.

TAMORA

    My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
    Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
    Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
    The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,
    Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;
    And rather comfort his distressed plight
    Than prosecute the meanest or the best
    For these contempts.

    Aside
    Why, thus it shall become
    High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:
    But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,
    Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,
    Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.

    Enter Clown
    How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?

Clown

    Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.

TAMORA

    Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.

Clown

    'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:
    I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.

    SATURNINUS reads the letter

SATURNINUS

    Go, take him away, and hang him presently.

Clown

    How much money must I have?

TAMORA

    Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.

Clown

    Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to
    a fair end.

    Exit, guarded

SATURNINUS

    Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
    Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
    I know from whence this same device proceeds:
    May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons,
    That died by law for murder of our brother,
    Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!
    Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;
    Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:
    For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;
    Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
    In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.

    Enter AEMILIUS
    What news with thee, AEmilius?

AEMILIUS

    Arm, arm, my lord;--Rome never had more cause.
    The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power
    high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,
    They hither march amain, under conduct
    Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;
    Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do
    As much as ever Coriolanus did.

SATURNINUS

    Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
    These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
    As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:
    Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:
    'Tis he the common people love so much;
    Myself hath often over-heard them say,
    When I have walked like a private man,
    That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,
    And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.

TAMORA

    Why should you fear? is not your city strong?

SATURNINUS

    Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,
    And will revolt from me to succor him.

TAMORA

    King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.
    Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?
    The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
    And is not careful what they mean thereby,
    Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
    He can at pleasure stint their melody:
    Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
    Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,
    I will enchant the old Andronicus
    With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,
    Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,
    When as the one is wounded with the bait,
    The other rotted with delicious feed.

SATURNINUS

    But he will not entreat his son for us.

TAMORA

    If Tamora entreat him, then he will:
    For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
    With golden promises; that, were his heart
    Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,
    Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.

    To AEmilius
    Go thou before, be our ambassador:
    Say that the emperor requests a parley
    Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting
    Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.

SATURNINUS

    AEmilius, do this message honourably:
    And if he stand on hostage for his safety,
    Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.

AEMILIUS

    Your bidding shall I do effectually.

    Exit

TAMORA

    Now will I to that old Andronicus;
    And temper him with all the art I have,
    To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.
    And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,
    And bury all thy fear in my devices.

SATURNINUS

    Then go successantly, and plead to him.

    Exeunt

ACT V
SCENE I. Plains near Rome.

    Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours

LUCIUS

    Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
    I have received letters from great Rome,
    Which signify what hate they bear their emperor
    And how desirous of our sight they are.
    Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,
    Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,
    And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
    Let him make treble satisfaction.

First Goth

    Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
    Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;
    Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
    Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,
    Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,
    Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
    Led by their master to the flowered fields,
    And be avenged on cursed Tamora.

All the Goths

    And as he saith, so say we all with him.

LUCIUS

    I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
    But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?

    Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms

Second Goth

    Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd
    To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
    And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye
    Upon the wasted building, suddenly
    I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
    I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
    The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
    'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
    Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
    Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
    Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:
    But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
    They never do beget a coal-black calf.
    Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates
    the babe,--
    'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;
    Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,
    Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
    With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,
    Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,
    To use as you think needful of the man.

LUCIUS

    O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
    That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;
    This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,
    And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
    Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey
    This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
    Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?
    A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.
    And by his side his fruit of bastardy.

AARON

    Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.

LUCIUS

    Too like the sire for ever being good.
    First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;
    A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
    Get me a ladder.

    A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend

AARON

    Lucius, save the child,
    And bear it from me to the empress.
    If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,
    That highly may advantage thee to hear:
    If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
    I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'

LUCIUS

    Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st
    Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.

AARON

    An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,
    'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
    For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,
    Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
    Complots of mischief, treason, villanies
    Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:
    And this shall all be buried by my death,
    Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.

LUCIUS

    Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.

AARON

    Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.

LUCIUS

    Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:
    That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?

AARON

    What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;
    Yet, for I know thou art religious
    And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
    With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
    Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
    Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
    An idiot holds his bauble for a god
    And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
    To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
    By that same god, what god soe'er it be,
    That thou adorest and hast in reverence,
    To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;
    Or else I will discover nought to thee.

LUCIUS

    Even by my god I swear to thee I will.

AARON

    First know thou, I begot him on the empress.

LUCIUS

    O most insatiate and luxurious woman!

AARON

    Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
    To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
    'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;
    They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
    And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.

LUCIUS

    O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?

AARON

    Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas
    Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.

LUCIUS

    O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!

AARON

    Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:
    That codding spirit had they from their mother,
    As sure a card as ever won the set;
    That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,
    As true a dog as ever fought at head.
    Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
    I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
    Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
    I wrote the letter that thy father found
    And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,
    Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
    And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
    Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
    I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,
    And, when I had it, drew myself apart
    And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
    I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
    When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
    Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,
    That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
    And when I told the empress of this sport,
    She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
    And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.

First Goth

    What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?

AARON

    Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.

LUCIUS

    Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?

AARON

    Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
    Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
    Few come within the compass of my curse,--
    Wherein I did not some notorious ill,
    As kill a man, or else devise his death,
    Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,
    Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,
    Set deadly enmity between two friends,
    Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
    Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
    And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
    Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
    And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
    Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;
    And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
    Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
    'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
    Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
    As willingly as one would kill a fly,
    And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
    But that I cannot do ten thousand more.

LUCIUS

    Bring down the devil; for he must not die
    So sweet a death as hanging presently.

AARON

    If there be devils, would I were a devil,
    To live and burn in everlasting fire,
    So I might have your company in hell,
    But to torment you with my bitter tongue!

LUCIUS

    Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.

    Enter a Goth

Third Goth

    My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
    Desires to be admitted to your presence.

LUCIUS

    Let him come near.

    Enter AEMILIUS
    Welcome, AEmilius what's the news from Rome?

AEMILIUS

    Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,
    The Roman emperor greets you all by me;
    And, for he understands you are in arms,
    He craves a parley at your father's house,
    Willing you to demand your hostages,
    And they shall be immediately deliver'd.

First Goth

    What says our general?

LUCIUS

    AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges
    Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,
    And we will come. March away.

    Exeunt

SCENE II. Rome. Before TITUS's house.

    Enter TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, disguised

TAMORA

    Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
    I will encounter with Andronicus,
    And say I am Revenge, sent from below
    To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
    Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,
    To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;
    Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,
    And work confusion on his enemies.

    They knock

    Enter TITUS, above

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Who doth molest my contemplation?
    Is it your trick to make me ope the door,
    That so my sad decrees may fly away,
    And all my study be to no effect?
    You are deceived: for what I mean to do
    See here in bloody lines I have set down;
    And what is written shall be executed.

TAMORA

    Titus, I am come to talk with thee.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,
    Wanting a hand to give it action?
    Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.

TAMORA

    If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    I am not mad; I know thee well enough:
    Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;
    Witness these trenches made by grief and care,
    Witness the tiring day and heavy night;
    Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well
    For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:
    Is not thy coming for my other hand?

TAMORA

    Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;
    She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:
    I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,
    To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,
    By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
    Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;
    Confer with me of murder and of death:
    There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
    No vast obscurity or misty vale,
    Where bloody murder or detested rape
    Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;
    And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,
    Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,
    To be a torment to mine enemies?

TAMORA

    I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Do me some service, ere I come to thee.
    Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
    Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,
    Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;
    And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,
    And whirl along with thee about the globe.
    Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,
    To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,
    And find out murderers in their guilty caves:
    And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
    I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel
    Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,
    Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
    Until his very downfall in the sea:
    And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
    So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.

TAMORA

    These are my ministers, and come with me.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?

TAMORA

    Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,
    Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!
    And you, the empress! but we worldly men
    Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.
    O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;
    And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,
    I will embrace thee in it by and by.

    Exit above

TAMORA

    This closing with him fits his lunacy
    Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,
    Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
    For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
    And, being credulous in this mad thought,
    I'll make him send for Lucius his son;
    And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
    I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,
    To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
    Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
    See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.

    Enter TITUS below

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:
    Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house:
    Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
    How like the empress and her sons you are!
    Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:
    Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
    For well I wot the empress never wags
    But in her company there is a Moor;
    And, would you represent our queen aright,
    It were convenient you had such a devil:
    But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?

TAMORA

    What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?

DEMETRIUS

    Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.

CHIRON

    Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
    And I am sent to be revenged on him.

TAMORA

    Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,
    And I will be revenged on them all.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;
    And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself.
    Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.
    Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap
    To find another that is like to thee,
    Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.
    Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court
    There is a queen, attended by a Moor;
    Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,
    for up and down she doth resemble thee:
    I pray thee, do on them some violent death;
    They have been violent to me and mine.

TAMORA

    Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
    But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
    To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,
    Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,
    And bid him come and banquet at thy house;
    When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,
    I will bring in the empress and her sons,
    The emperor himself and all thy foes;
    And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,
    And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
    What says Andronicus to this device?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.

    Enter MARCUS
    Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;
    Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:
    Bid him repair to me, and bring with him
    Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;
    Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:
    Tell him the emperor and the empress too
    Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.
    This do thou for my love; and so let him,
    As he regards his aged father's life.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    This will I do, and soon return again.

    Exit

TAMORA

    Now will I hence about thy business,
    And take my ministers along with me.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;
    Or else I'll call my brother back again,
    And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.

TAMORA

    [Aside to her sons] What say you, boys? will you
    bide with him,
    Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
    How I have govern'd our determined jest?
    Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
    And tarry with him till I turn again.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    [Aside] I know them all, though they suppose me mad,
    And will o'erreach them in their own devices:
    A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!

DEMETRIUS

    Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.

TAMORA

    Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes
    To lay a complot to betray thy foes.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.

    Exit TAMORA

CHIRON

    Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Tut, I have work enough for you to do.
    Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!

    Enter PUBLIUS and others

PUBLIUS

    What is your will?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Know you these two?

PUBLIUS

    The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived;
    The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;
    And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.
    Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.
    Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,
    And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,
    And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.

    Exit

    PUBLIUS, & c. lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS

CHIRON

    Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.

PUBLIUS

    And therefore do we what we are commanded.
    Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
    Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.

    Re-enter TITUS, with LAVINIA; he bearing a knife, and she a basin

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
    Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;
    But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
    O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
    Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
    This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.
    You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault
    Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,
    My hand cut off and made a merry jest;
    Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
    Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
    Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced.
    What would you say, if I should let you speak?
    Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
    Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.
    This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
    Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
    The basin that receives your guilty blood.
    You know your mother means to feast with me,
    And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:
    Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust
    And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,
    And of the paste a coffin I will rear
    And make two pasties of your shameful heads,
    And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,
    Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
    This is the feast that I have bid her to,
    And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
    For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,
    And worse than Progne I will be revenged:
    And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,

    He cuts their throats
    Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
    Let me go grind their bones to powder small
    And with this hateful liquor temper it;
    And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.
    Come, come, be every one officious
    To make this banquet; which I wish may prove
    More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
    So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,
    And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.

    Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies

SCENE III. Court of TITUS's house. A banquet set out.

    Enter LUCIUS, MARCUS, and Goths, with AARON prisoner

LUCIUS

    Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind
    That I repair to Rome, I am content.

First Goth

    And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.

LUCIUS

    Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
    This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;
    Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him
    Till he be brought unto the empress' face,
    For testimony of her foul proceedings:
    And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
    I fear the emperor means no good to us.

AARON

    Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,
    And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth
    The venomous malice of my swelling heart!

LUCIUS

    Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!
    Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.

    Exeunt Goths, with AARON. Flourish within
    The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.

    Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA, with AEMILIUS, Tribunes, Senators, and others

SATURNINUS

    What, hath the firmament more suns than one?

LUCIUS

    What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;
    These quarrels must be quietly debated.
    The feast is ready, which the careful Titus
    Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,
    For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:
    Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.

SATURNINUS

    Marcus, we will.

    Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table

    Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook, LAVINIA veiled, Young LUCIUS, and others. TITUS places the dishes on the table

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;
    Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;
    And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,
    'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.

SATURNINUS

    Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Because I would be sure to have all well,
    To entertain your highness and your empress.

TAMORA

    We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    An if your highness knew my heart, you were.
    My lord the emperor, resolve me this:
    Was it well done of rash Virginius
    To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
    Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?

SATURNINUS

    It was, Andronicus.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Your reason, mighty lord?

SATURNINUS

    Because the girl should not survive her shame,
    And by her presence still renew his sorrows.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
    A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,
    For me, most wretched, to perform the like.
    Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;

    Kills LAVINIA
    And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!

SATURNINUS

    What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
    I am as woful as Virginius was,
    And have a thousand times more cause than he
    To do this outrage: and it now is done.

SATURNINUS

    What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Will't please you eat? will't please your
    highness feed?

TAMORA

    Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:
    They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;
    And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.

SATURNINUS

    Go fetch them hither to us presently.

TITUS ANDRONICUS

    Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;
    Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
    Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
    'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.

    Kills TAMORA

SATURNINUS

    Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!

    Kills TITUS

LUCIUS

    Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
    There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!

    Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS, MARCUS, and others go up into the balcony

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
    By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl
    Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,
    O, let me teach you how to knit again
    This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,
    These broken limbs again into one body;
    Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
    And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,
    Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
    Do shameful execution on herself.
    But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
    Grave witnesses of true experience,
    Cannot induce you to attend my words,

    To LUCIUS
    Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
    When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
    To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
    The story of that baleful burning night
    When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,
    Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,
    Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
    That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
    My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
    Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
    But floods of tears will drown my oratory,
    And break my utterance, even in the time
    When it should move you to attend me most,
    Lending your kind commiseration.
    Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
    Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.

LUCIUS

    Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,
    That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
    Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;
    And they it were that ravished our sister:
    For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;
    Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd
    Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
    And sent her enemies unto the grave.
    Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
    The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,
    To beg relief among Rome's enemies:
    Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.
    And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
    I am the turned forth, be it known to you,
    That have preserved her welfare in my blood;
    And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
    Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.
    Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;
    My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
    That my report is just and full of truth.
    But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
    Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;
    For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:

    Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant
    Of this was Tamora delivered;
    The issue of an irreligious Moor,
    Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
    The villain is alive in Titus' house,
    And as he is, to witness this is true.
    Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
    These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,
    Or more than any living man could bear.
    Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?
    Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,
    And, from the place where you behold us now,
    The poor remainder of Andronici
    Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.
    And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,
    And make a mutual closure of our house.
    Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,
    Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.

AEMILIUS

    Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
    And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
    Lucius our emperor; for well I know
    The common voice do cry it shall be so.

All

    Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,

    To Attendants
    And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,
    To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,
    As punishment for his most wicked life.

    Exeunt Attendants

    LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend

All

    Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!

LUCIUS

    Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,
    To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!
    But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
    For nature puts me to a heavy task:
    Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,
    To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
    O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,

    Kissing TITUS
    These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,
    The last true duties of thy noble son!

MARCUS ANDRONICUS

    Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
    Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
    O were the sum of these that I should pay
    Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!

LUCIUS

    Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
    To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:
    Many a time he danced thee on his knee,
    Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:
    Many a matter hath he told to thee,
    Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;
    In that respect, then, like a loving child,
    Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
    Because kind nature doth require it so:
    Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:
    Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
    Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.

Young LUCIUS

    O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart
    Would I were dead, so you did live again!
    O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;
    My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.

    Re-enter Attendants with AARON

AEMILIUS

    You sad Andronici, have done with woes:
    Give sentence on this execrable wretch,
    That hath been breeder of these dire events.

LUCIUS

    Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
    There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;
    If any one relieves or pities him,
    For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
    Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.

AARON

    O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
    I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
    I should repent the evils I have done:
    Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
    Would I perform, if I might have my will;
    If one good deed in all my life I did,
    I do repent it from my very soul.

LUCIUS

    Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,
    And give him burial in his father's grave:
    My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
    Be closed in our household's monument.
    As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,
    No funeral rite, nor man in mourning weeds,
    No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
    But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:
    Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;
    And, being so, shall have like want of pity.
    See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
    By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:
    Then, afterwards, to order well the state,
    That like events may ne'er it ruinate.

    Exeunt
