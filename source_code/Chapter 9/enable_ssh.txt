# Log in at the console, the default credentials are:
# bitnami:bitnami
# you will be prompted to change your password the first
# time you log in. You should change it, as everyone on your
# local network will be able to access your VM and hence
# able to SSH into it once SSH is enabled.

# We need to move the SSH config into place

sudo mv /etc/init/ssh.conf.back /etc/init/ssh.conf

# and then start SSH.

sudo start ssh

# SSH will now be started automatically each time the VM is
# started.
